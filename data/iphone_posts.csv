First click on the “+” symbol. This will start a new shortcut for you to use. Click on open app, and then once your shortcut is created, click on “App.” Now you can choose whichever app you want to decorate and change the photo or name of your choice. Once it’s added, you can click on the icon to the top right, and then at home screen where you can change the name and the photo. I think this only works on the later models I’m on my IPad 10th Gen for this, but I’m able to do it on my IPhone 14 as well. ",2025-04-08 01:12:55+00:00,1,0

1ju1m1w,techsupport,Trouble with bluetooth headphones,"Hi all,

At the end of last year i upgraded to the iphone 16 and my earphones (powerbeats x) which were working fine on my iphone 13 had a weird issue. I would connect the earphones and they would work completely normally with no issues but the next day they would just not be picked up by my phone. It would say not connected even though they were charged, i would try disconnecting them and reconnecting but they wouldnt be able to connect until I restarted my phone. I at first thought that it might be the earphones as they are old but i have some soundcore earphones now but they have the exact same issue. It is really annoying have to restart my phone everyday just to use my earphones. 

Any and all help would be much appreciated, if you have any further questions let me know.",2025-04-08 01:12:22+00:00,1,1

1ju1ig4,sennheiser,Secondhand purchases and upgrades.,"Hi Sennheiser Reddit. 

A little over a year ago, I got my 458BTs refurbished from a store. While I have no idea how old they were when I picked them up, they've served me very well for this past year, and especially well given the price I paid ($70 CAD). 

However. All good things must come to an end, and I'm concerned that I might be approaching the end of the road with my current set. About a few weeks ago, I noticed that my headphones began playing a constant trill of beeps whenever I had them on but not playing music. This problem does go away when I start playing music, so it's not a dealbreaker... yet. (I've also had some concerns about how quickly the battery life goes from 20% to 0, but that's me nitpicking.)

Last week, while running late for a event, my 458s refused to connect with my iphone. I pulled out a backup set and completed my day as normal, but I'm concerned that this will become a long running issue in the future. 

Fast forward to today. I've browsed the store I got the 458s from and saw that they're selling Momentum 4s (again, refurbished), for $200 CAD. I feel like I can reasonably trust the seller. The price is acceptable (the official website has a price tag of $500 CAD in comparison), and I'm unsure how long my current set can keep going before becoming unusable. 

With the preamble out of the way, I have two questions. 

1: For those who have upgraded from the 450BTs (or any low end model, for that matter) to the Momentum series, what is the difference? Is the sound much better? Are there more smart control features compared to the relatively basic options available for the 458s? 

2: For those who have bought secondhand/refurbished, what can I expect as the lifetime of my product? A year? Two? More than that? 

Thanks. ",2025-04-08 01:07:13+00:00,1,0

1ju1h2y,Ghosts,Gettysburg Pennsylvania USA Photos from 14 Years Ago from a Digital Camera,"The first one I think is a better shot. All the way on the right you can see a man walking. This was near the site of a major battle. At first I thought m the top was his head and you follow it down to his legs. However, now with iPhones I was able to up the contrast and kill the shadows and the top looks more like a face.

The other capture in this picture is next to the excavator. By the scooper part it almost looks like 2 legs kinda bowed out, as if riding a horse. And you can follow it up as well to what looks like a head.

Picture 2 has a couple of lines. They look similar to composition of the first pic but that’s about it. Both photos were taken while we were driving around with the windows down, just firing off shots from a digital camera.

1ju14a8,ShotWithHalide,Kino auto motion. Confuses my brain.,"I want to love the app.  So much.  But I’m thinking - probably over thinking it. 

My setup is usually an iPhone in a cage and a VND filter as a minimum. 

Firstly I’ve noticed the white balance shift once I start filming and especially if I use a VND filter and make an adjustment.  

I have white balance and exposure locked but I think the ND freaks out the app?

I can’t get my head around the auto-motion. 

When I shoot with the ND what’s best practice to get the 180 degree rule. Do I turn the ND until the icon goes green for auto motion? Is that what is meant to happen. 


I don’t want the camera to be pushing stupid high ISO if I don’t have to. Less is best and all that.  It looks like the  ND confuses the app here too as it tries to set exposure compensating for the ND?

If I have it in manual do I still get auto motion or is it only in auto. 

I can’t seem to get answers off the net so hope you can help me out.

1ju12rb,exredpill,Groomed through “hypnosis” by a fake Dom,"Hi — I’m posting anonymously because I still feel sick and ashamed about what happened. I recently came out of a dangerous situation involving my abusive ex. I was starting to put things back together when I got pulled into something I didn’t even realize was happening until I was deep in it. It was incredibly dark. 

I was contacted by someone through a dating app who started off fairly normal. But within a few days, he had escalated into sending me a near constant stream of voice messages he later described as “hypnosis.” At first, I thought it was just weird kink stuff — but it wasn’t. It was layered, trance-like language about “training” me, “erasing” my thoughts, “reprogramming” me. He used things like “good girl,” “brainless,” “chains,” and started talking about moving in with me to train me within 48 hours of contact. 

The recordings became increasingly disturbing.  I wasn’t allowed to have “thoughts”. He told me women were meant to be dominated by men and what I thought was rape was actually something I wanted, like all women, and enjoyed. The real trauma, he said, was that society convinces women they don’t want to be dominated in that way. 

He started describing horrific punishments and asking me to send compromising pictures. I genuinely don’t remember chunks of time. He had me staying up so late days in a row that I could barely function. I was in a fog and the recordings kept getting darker and darker. 

I stayed in contact for a few days. I didn’t feel like I had consented to anything — I just kept trying to manage the situation and not set him off. I didn’t remember how it even started. I barely remember the early conversations. I was scared, numb, entranced. And then suddenly I realized I’d spent hours listening to recordings designed to break me down.

When I started researching him, I realized the name he gave me may not be real. 

Also, random detail, he let slip once “my microphone fell down”. These were voice notes on an iPhone so I was confused, but I think this guy has an actual mic to produce these trance-like recordings. 

If anyone else has been targeted by men like this — using hypnosis or TPE training scripts, especially disguised as healing — I would really appreciate hearing how you made sense of it. I’m still in a fog and I want to understand how this happened before it happens to anyone else.

Thank you.

I previously posted about my iPhone app that helps measure proptosis in thyroid eye disease. I received great feedback from this community, so I decided to re-purpose the app for patients instead of healthcare providers—and made it completely free. It does not collect any data or require registration.

In addition to creating a 3D model of the face for measurement, I added features to save measurements and plot changes over time. This allows you to track any shifts in eye position.

App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/graves-and-thyroid-eye-disease/id6744029087

Video of the App in Action: https://youtu.be/uckDkf_7GcU?si=lNnjA4vlV9ydxF4o

This is not a medical-grade device and shouldn’t be used to make clinical decisions, but I think it’s a fun and educational tool that patients with thyroid eye disease might find useful.

Thanks for letting me share! Again—it's totally free and doesn’t collect user data.",2025-04-08 00:24:31+00:00,4,2

I'm (19F). The sad thing is last year and after I would have friends that would come over they were my age and a little younger but she would tell my friends the same exact thing and they would make fun of me and quit being my friend over this also my will make my friends put their phones up because she doesn't like what they go on she it's because she doesn't want me watching their phones. It hurts me like I'm not 5 or 8 anymore and I told her I said how many 19 year olds parents that have 19 year old do you here their parents tell them to do these things and then make their friends do these things and my mom will also tell my specialist this and my specialist was like how old is she 17 at the time and my specialist saw how embarrassed I was and I told my specialist I don't need my mom to tell me these things. My mom was like yes I do you have ADD and she said that to my specialist and my specialist face omg was priceless she was like some people with ADHD have problems following these tasks but someone with ADD is totally different so my specialist talk to me privately because I was furious at my mom I kept all in but my facial expression ig I can't hide well.

My aunts will laugh at me they use to but they asked me last year and they were like your mom still tells you do this. With the whole retainers thing my mom doesn't think I don't wear them ig she's like they are a little crooked no they are not I looked in the mirror my dad agreed with my mom my family everybody that I know at school I was very bothered by this actually that is my fear to have crooked teeth again I had braces on for 5 years heck no not going back to having braces again.

1ju0cml,thestallionvibe,$AAPL and $AVGO: Tariff Impacts and Market Moves,"The recent tariff announcements have sent ripples through the US stock market, affecting major players like $AAPL and $AVGO. Here’s a rundown of the latest developments and their potential impacts on investors.

$AAPL's Tariff Strategies and Market Reactions

$AAPL has been navigating the complexities of the new US tariffs, which have significantly impacted its supply chain. The company is reportedly shifting more of its iPhone production to India to mitigate the effects of the 54% tariff on goods from China. This move is expected to meet about 50% of American demand for iPhones, according to the Wall Street Journal. $AAPL is also exploring exemptions from the tariffs and has stocked up on inventory to delay the impact until the next quarter.

The tariffs have already taken a toll on $AAPL's stock price, erasing $300 billion from its market cap. The company is likely to squeeze its suppliers and lower margins to keep iPhone prices stable, which could affect its profitability in the short term. However, the long-term strategy of diversifying its supply chain could pay off if the tariffs remain in place.

$AVGO's Share Buyback Program

$AVGO has announced a share buyback program of up to $10 billion, set to run through the end of the year. This move comes after the company closed up 5.37% on Monday and saw an additional 3%+ jump after hours. Share buybacks are often seen as a positive sign for investors, as they can increase earnings per share and boost stock prices. This program could help $AVGO weather the storm of market volatility caused by the tariffs.

Regional Banks and Market Volatility

Regional banks have been hit hard by the tariff announcements, with the KBW Regional Banking Index dipping 13% since April 2. The larger banks, while also facing pressure, have more diversified revenue streams to offset declines in lending. However, the overall economic uncertainty driven by the tariffs is a concern for all financial institutions.

Investors are keeping their cash close to home, with upwards of $60 billion pumped into money market funds in the first few days of April. This shift indicates a cautious approach as the market navigates the tariff impacts and potential recession fears.

Conclusion

The tariffs are creating a challenging environment for US stocks, but companies like $AAPL and $AVGO are taking strategic steps to mitigate the impacts. Investors should keep an eye on these developments and consider the long-term implications for their portfolios. As always, diversification and a long-term perspective can help navigate market volatility.",2025-04-08 00:08:28+00:00,1,0

1ju08om,mac,new to apple - m4 mba for app dev & value iphone for testing?,"hey everyone!

long-time android/windows user here, thinking of finally making the jump to the apple world with a mac and iphone. got a couple of questions and would love your thoughts!

my main reasons for switching are:

1. macs seems to be the best value laptop right now.
2. want to get into app development (mostly ios), and apple's dominance in the us market makes sense for that.

i'm leaning towards the new m4 macbook air, planning to use it for app dev (xcode & cursor), maybe some light ai training, occasional adobe suite, and video editing. my current windows laptop is over 5 years old with 16gb ram, so i'm wondering if i should future-proof the mba with 24gb or even 32gb of ram to last me through college (4-5 years). is that overkill, or a good investment?

also, should i even be considering stepping down to an m2 mba or maybe an older macbook pro for better value?

finally, what's the best value iphone to get purely for testing apps? i'm pretty happy with my current android as my daily driver. would a cheaper, older iphone be sufficient for testing, or are there significant benefits to getting a more modern iphone that would make it worthwhile to use as my main phone and pair with the mac?

any advice would be super appreciated! thanks in advance! 😊",2025-04-08 00:02:58+00:00,1,1

Fucking huge device + very delayed updates being pushed to the phones by samsung

So I asked him again if he had anything to disclose? How hard has he been working on his recovery? Has it been as perfect as he claims it is?  Then he confessed: he’s been watching videos on iTunes.

1jtzyif,UFOs,Saw this while walking. Open to ideas.,"Time: 8:05pm

Location: Henderson Nevada 

I don’t like to jump to conclusions so I will keep it short and not add my speculation opting instead for just the facts of what I witnessed. I was on an evening walk with my mother when we both stopped talking and looked at a strange color changing orb in the sky. We both started to record and I managed to get the ball of light moving across the sky but just as I stopped recording and it started to vanish right in font of our eyes. 

At the time I was not aware that my mom was still recording and she captured the object phasing out of visibility. In person in looked as if it cloaked but I don’t want to speculate so it vanished is the simplest way I could put it. There was no sound and visible tail like a comet or shooting star. It was shifting colors and there was no haze or light scatter. It was moving steady but not super fast. 

The videos do this no justice at all. It was so bright and vivid and moved as if there was no friction. I then recorded the airplanes flying around just to show how different the light from aircraft look as opposed to this object on camera let alone in person. I can post those for comparison if anyone wants to compare just let me know. All in all I’m not sure what it is but neither of us can figure it out. You can see the aircraft and they are daily identifiable in the area we walk in so this stood out and was nothing like the rest of what we saw. If anyone has ideas or speculation don’t hesitate chime in. 

Both cameras capture a slightly different aspect as they zoom to different. The iPhone was able to get close but it still not close enough so it looked like a flashing dot. The Samsung zooms in further and you can see it is a circular object just as it fades into nothing.

I really don't know what I'm doing, of course coloring is basic and nothing like what you see here (you are all awesome, like I'm amazed!) but it means a lot to me. So, my sister shared her Lake's subscription with me, and wow, it's a lot of fun! Pigment seems great too, but Lake is nice that you can share your anual subscription with your family via Apple's Family Sharing. I sacrifice the gallery aspect (I feel overwhelmed by it tho, so I'm fine by not having it, like I closed my personal Instagram for feeling that way lmao) and importing images (which I would love, but it's still fine) for being able to share one single subscription with family, plus I really like and enjoy the color palettes for how you feel and the emotional aspect on Lake! Also Lake is way cheaper (20$ anual vs 60$ anual).

I’ve seen the hobby around, but I was always afraid to try physical coloring, like it wasn't for me, I just knew that. I’ve always been the clumsy girl who went outside the lines—honestly, that was pretty traumatic for me. And... I also have a big panic to markers (I’m probably undiagnosed autistic)—I hate, despise the texture, even thinking about them gives me goosebumps and a horrible feeling. And I always pressed hard on the crayons and pencils. Coloring was never a pleasant experience. I don't have a good time, in short, and never had. When teachers made us color in kindergarten, I really struggled.

So finding about digital coloring was like a dream come true for my child! I feel my little girl healing when I was scolded for stepping out of the lines, for not wanting to use markers, for pressing hard on the pencils. I was always so clumsy. I don't pretend to be a pro at all, but my little girl is so happy and I'm having fun.

I used my Iphone and my fingers, but I'm now REALLY tempted to buy a cheap kinda old Ipad just for this little hobby specifically (I already have a good PC and laptop, so I don't want to spend too much either -can't either-, if it has last system update it's f). I was checking if I find an Ipad 7th generation in Canada's Best Buy (my sister's currently in Toronto!) as in my country people are still charging $350 for an used 7th generation Ipad, and yeah....

So excited to learn more about coloring, tecniches and tips!",2025-04-07 23:46:49+00:00,3,1

1jtzvpw,MetaQuestVR,Workouts not recording to iPhone,"After Meta disabled the Move app, my VR workouts don’t seem to automatically record to my iPhone. I have a history of “fitness gaming” through March, but today’s Bodycombat session didn’t show up after I synced the headset.

1jtzuqv,VITURE,Backbone controller + USBC hub?,"I have a backbone controller which uses the USBC on the iphone. There is a USBC port on the outside which you can use to connect to for example an ipad. So i thought great i can just put my phone in, then use the USBC port to connect the glasses. But no, i am guessing that port supports everything but video. I tried also using a usbc hub to the phone, then, use 1 USBC on the hub for the controller and 1 for the glasses, and, again controller works but not the glasses. Strange thing is glasses do get power as they turn dark, but no video. I know the hub supports video out as i can use it with a laptop and a monitor. Anyone tried anything like this? I saw a new controller just came out that does just this but see no reason why the one i have can't work :(",2025-04-07 23:44:40+00:00,0,0

I tried asking apple directly for a repair and they say they couldn’t since i don’t have apple care, and so i was wondering if anyone knows good quality phones that could last me long and that i can still transfer my data from my old phone to a new one, and nothing to expensive as I just need it for communication and basic necessities. 

I also have a iPad Pro 17in and i use it for college and to draw as that is my hobbies, the thing is my screen is kinda coming off and I don’t know if the problem is coming from the inside. Anyways if there are any recommendations on a laptop or desk top that i can use for school and to continue my digital art hobbies, as well as gaming if possible, and preferably something not over the thousands.

With the proliferation of digital platforms ranging from emails and SMS to social media and encrypted messaging apps our interactions have become more layered, nuanced, and, at times, difficult to decipher. In this ever-expanding digital landscape, uncovering hidden messages and interpreting digital behavior has emerged as a complex yet essential task.

Partnering with MotionHackersHub, a leader in digital intelligence and analysis, has brought to light the growing importance of transparency, trust, and awareness in modern communication. What once may have been considered a simple emoji, a vague message, or an unassuming exchange can now carry layered meanings or conceal intent entirely. Subtext, subtle digital cues, and platform specific behaviors often communicate more than what is explicitly stated.

Every digital platform functions like a separate room within a digital house, each with its own set of doors, locks, and curtains where meaningful interactions may occur out of sight. While privacy features such as end-to-end encryption are essential for safeguarding personal data, these same protections can also be leveraged to disguise conversations or obscure digital footprints. As a result, interpreting online behavior becomes increasingly difficult without the right tools and expertise.

Hidden or encoded communication may stem from a variety of motives. In some cases, these exchanges may be harmless perhaps representing a desire for personal space or discretion. In others, they may point to more complex scenarios such as deceptive communication, digital infidelity, workplace misconduct, or data concealment. Regardless of the context, the presence of secrecy in digital channels can significantly challenge the trust and transparency that are foundational to healthy relationships and secure professional environments.

They specializes in uncovering the subtle intricacies of digital behavior. With a deep understanding of platform algorithms, data patterns, and communication trends, their team is equipped to help individuals and organizations interpret digital signals with accuracy and confidentiality. Whether you’re concerned about inconsistencies in communication, need support in a personal or professional matter, or simply want to better understand how digital environments operate, they provides tailored, ethical, and discreet solutions.

Their services include:
	•	Digital behavior analysis
	•	Platform-specific activity monitoring
	•	Data recovery and interpretation
	•	Digital footprint assessments
	•	Confidential consultations for individuals and organizations

Importantly, all services are delivered with a strong commitment to privacy, professionalism, and legal compliance. Their team prioritizes clarity and discretion, ensuring that clients receive actionable insights without compromising integrity.

Conclusion

In a world where communication can be both vast and veiled, understanding the hidden layers of digital interaction is more than a technical skill it’s a vital aspect of safeguarding trust, relationships, and decision-making. If you’re seeking clarity in a sea of digital uncertainty, partnering with experienced professionals can make all the difference.

1jtzfvr,CreditCards,Fraud alert on my non-verbal father's credit card,"Hey everyone, im hoping someone can help. My father had a massive stroke a few months back and is still non-verbal. He got a fraud alert on his card that was actually our purchase. Anyway, I added myself as an authorized user on his account, thinking they would let me clear it up, since it was our purchase for medical crap. I have talked to Citi twice, went to a branch twice with both his and my cards and nothing. They keep saying ""we need to speak with the account holder. Well, he cant talk.

So I tried the TTY function on the iPhone and the call keeps dropping, as I dont think Im doing it right.

So after my 5th attempt, I pleaded with the woman at Citi and she said that I had to fax a power of attorney to them. I dont have power of attorney.

Is that really my only option left? We made the purchases, I just want this thing cleared up, it's driving me insane. I assume if I just cancel the card the fraud alert will carry over to a new card?

1jtz7e5,iPhoneSE,iPhone SE 2016 Hotspot hosting issue,"Hi,
I have two 2016 iPhone SE phones, one at iOS 13 and other at 14. I also have a SE2 on iOS 16 I normally used.

I decided to start using iOS 13 SE to decrease my screen time yesterday. I was keeping my SE2 with me in plane mode, just in case I needed it (which I did).

So I needed to get a online quiz and Moddle website was not loading properly on iOS 13 like many websites don’t nowadays.

Tried opening hotspot on my SE to use wifi on my SE2, the hotspot setting was missing but came back after I entered my internet providers APN in settings. It even prompted to automatically connect to it on my SE2, I clicked in it but it got stuck at loading/connecting to the hotspot wifi, tried forgetting network to reconnect and also restarted the phone but nothing worked.

Anyway now I tried my SIM in my iOS 14 SE and I was expecting hotspot to work this time but nope the exact same issue. Trying to connect to the hotspot with my Xperia phone showed that it gets stuck at acquiring IP and never actually successfully connecting to the hotspot wifi, trying with the SE2 has the infinite connecting loading going on.

Does anyone know why my 2016 SEs are unable to host a functional hotspot? My SE2 can do it perfectly fine and Xperia can also host a funcional hotspot with the same SIM.",2025-04-07 23:14:02+00:00,2,2

1jtyzt5,CastroPodcast,Marker for new episodes that have come in since the last time I opened the app,"I love the little blue dot that appears on the inbox tab of the iPhone app when new episodes have come in since the last time I opened the app. 

I would also like it if there was a blue dot — or some other indicator — next to the inbox listing for each new episode that has come in since the last time I opened the app. 

Based on the way Castro is designed, it seems like the inbox is intended as a place where new episodes come in but ALSO has a place where episodes can be stored until the user is ready to listen to them. Having an indication of which episodes are new would make it easier to use the inbox for that second purpose. 

Thanks! Great job on the app. I switched from Overcast a few weeks ago and I'm glad I did. ",2025-04-07 23:04:27+00:00,3,0
1jtyzt2,indiehackers,Calmer: A tiny mental health app quietly gaining traction in a massive niche,"Been noticing a trend lately where simple, niche mobile apps, especially in wellness and mental health are starting to find real traction without any big marketing push.

One example I came across recently is an app called Calmer. It’s designed to help people manage anxiety and panic attacks. It's super minimalist with no endless onboarding or overly branded UX. Just quick exercises to calm the user down when things spiral.

What’s interesting is that it has very little buzz on tech Twitter or indie circles, but it’s already getting strong organic reviews (4.9 stars), growing steadily, and seems to resonate with people who just want something that works.

You can check it out here:

📱 iOS: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anxiety-panic-relief-calmer/id6502701857?platform=iphone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anxiety-panic-relief-calmer/id6502701857?platform=iphone)

📱 Android: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.calmer.anxiety\_panic\_attack\_relief](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.calmer.anxiety_panic_attack_relief)

Feels like we’re entering an era where small, focused apps can carve out sustainable niches without needing huge teams or brand noise, especially when the problem they solve is real and specific.

Curious if anyone else is seeing success with similar “micro-apps” in the mental health or wellness space",2025-04-07 23:04:27+00:00,23,3

•	⁠Country: US

•	⁠Condition: new or old/pre-owned

•	⁠Type of Camera: digital (?)

•	⁠Intended use: hybrid (although more emphasis on photography)

•	⁠If photography; what style: portrait 

•	⁠If video what style: vlogging

•	⁠Portability: strap or small bag

•	⁠Cameras you're considering: Sony A5000

•	⁠Cameras you already have: IPhone 12

•	⁠Notes:
I want to use the camera to take really nice photos of family and friends as well as cosplays since I’ve really been into photo editing recently. I’ll be using the video feature for more personal usages like recording memories so the quality of the video doesn’t have to be the best but possibly better than my current iPhone. 
I was considering the Sony A5000 but then I noticed it didn’t have a viewfinder which I’ve seen a lot of people say is preferred for photography

1jtyj4x,Smartphones,Upgrading from the iPhone 12 mini,"Hey everyone! I'm currently running an iPhone 12 mini with 128 GB of memory and 75% of maximum charge capacity (yikes).

I've recently been noticing my phone bas been slower with iOS updates, as well as draining its battery way faster than usual, going from 100% to 70% in a matter of an hour and a half of not very intensive use, maybe faster.

I have come across the opportunity to upgrade soon-ish and I have a few questions and I'm looking for some recommendations and experiences.

So, I'm considering buying/trading into a new iPhone 16 (base 128 GB model, or 256 GB e model) or a refurbished 256 GB iPhone 15 pro.

What are your guys' experiences/recommendations and if anyone is still using the 12 mini, would it be worth it upgrading/replacing the battery and keeping it for a few more years?

It's worth noting that phone size isn't really that much of an important factor for me, it is quite convenient having a smaller phone, however I am a bit sick of the small screen for gaming and watching video content.   
  
I'm open to suggestions! (preferably within the Apple ecosystem)

1jtydmj,verizon,Trade-In Nightmare,"Hey everybody, I’m making this post as a warning to any future potential trade-in prospects.

I got the Z Fold 6 around 6 months ago, and decided it was not for me, as it was my first android device. I wanted to go back to iPhone and decided to just take the loss on the phone and opted for a trade-in and got the iPhone 16 pro 256gb for $0 after the trade in. 

I kept the Z Fold 6 for around 4 months and then switched back, I shipped the Z fold 6 January 13th and it arrived at Verizon’s warehouse shortly after. I imagined that it would take a week or two to inspect and issue credit to my account. Though Verizon actually gave me the $1,000 credit before they inspected it. 

Verizon decided to take their time for another 2 months, in the meantime I didn’t bother with it because the credit was still being applied. I was essentially just paying for the data service ~$120. 

Around early April I was suddenly sent an email by Verizon stating that because they did not receive my device they charge-backed the credit, this of course sent me into a panic as this was a lot of money that was being taken away from me. I quickly got into contact with Verizon and after a long support request help, I was told that they did have my device but could not do anything about the bill, until the next billing cycle which was now double the previous, at ~$250. 

The representative eventually found the device and after confirming with me they had it (after costing me an additional ~$130) and the stress from claiming that I had not sent the device in. They decided to offer a new plan they had, which I found completely unacceptable. 

I rebuffed the representative for the lack of situation awareness and declined compensation, because frankly at the moment I had made my mind to leave the company after the situation was settled. 

Currently I’m still in the process of them fixing the billing issue & getting my device inspected. I’m making this post to allow others who want to come to this company to be aware of what you may be put through. 


Edit - I put this as a comment but wanted to make sure it was seen. The trade in device was sent in 1 day after I receive the iPhone 16. I mistakenly made it seem as though I waited 4 months to send it in, when I did not mean that at all. Sorry about the confusion. ",2025-04-07 22:36:03+00:00,0,2

1jtyag1,jailbreak,[Help] Dopamine & TrollStore completely stopped working. iPhone 14 PM iOS 16.5,"So some back story just in case it helps with troubleshooting the issue…

A few weeks ago I organized my device a bit and put some apps into folders and everything was fine. 

Then about a few days ago I noticed that my jailbreak folder was missing all the apps that I put in the folder. The only app remaining in the folder was Dopamine.

Which still didn’t cause any issues that I noticed. 

Then today my device was still jailbroken and working fine, until I wanted to reboot userspace. which I usually do thru dopamine since it’s just more convenient then typing the command into NewTerm.

Well I tried opening dopamine and it wouldn’t open.

So I open iCleaner Pro and ran iCleaner Pro. My device resprings and still jailbroken. 
But still Dopamine would not open.

So I open NewTerm and manually reboot userspace. 
Which worked fine and I was still jailbroken. 

But still Dopamine still wouldn’t open.

So I figured, let me hard reboot my device and re-jailbreak. 

Well after my device was done rebooting I put my passcode in and I noticed that the dopamine icon had been replaced by a white default icon. 

I tried opening dopamine figuring it might be an icon cache issue, but it still wouldn’t open.

So I figured let me open up TrollStore and see if maybe un-installing an re-installing Dopamine would fix the issue…

Well I come to see that even TrollStore will not open as well.

I have also provided a short video showing dopamine and TrollStore not opening on my device.

So if anyone has a solution to this problem it would be greatly appreciated!

1jty6rb,AppleCard,Beware Confusion = Huge Credit Hit,"TL;DR:  if you’re used to “normal” credit cards, don’t let this AppleCard (or the ‘installment payments) confuse you into f’ing your credit for no good reason. 



For context, I have >$150K in clear and paid off CC lines, haven’t had a late payment in >20 years, and before this had a credit score of 845. 

Now my score is 100 points lower, because a measly $44 overdue a measly 30 days, —- due to my confusion + Apple not making any normal effort to contact me. 

THE PURCHASE: 

In November I buy a new iPhone at an AppleStore. Memory foggy, but I believe my iPhone/iOS, in-store, offers me to instead receive and pay with an Apple CC. Not even sure why I accepted, but sounded fine. 

Before leaving the store, I decide to buy a case. Apparently, I chose to do so on installment payments? 

THE (INTENDED) PAYOFF: 

Because I always pay my balances off each month, the next month I “paid off” the “outstanding balance” (as I understood it) on the phone and case to $0. 

Thought that was that. 

THE CATCH: 

What I don’t know was that each next month a $4.08 “installment” charge was still coming for the dumb phone case. I hadn’t paid off EVERYTHING I owed, I’d paid off the phone + what case installments were due at that time. I don’t appreciate that more $4.08 charges were coming each month. 

CRAP NOTICE, AND NO COURTESY TEXT/CALL

My other cards send me texts, snail mail statements, and — the few times there’s been a mistake — call me if a payment has been a few days overdue. 

AppleCard?  None of that. 

Seems there are only notices in the WalletApp, if you happen to look at that app for such info (I never had reasons to), OR to your appleID email address (which is essentially my junk mail account). 

Absent paper statements, texts, or a call, I had no idea $4.08 was overdue. 

CHASE BANK TO THE RESCUE

Cut a few months ahead, and my Chase credit monitor gave me 30 days overdue notice, and I immediately searched up the applecard on wallet app, and paid off remaining $44 balance on the dumb phone case. 

PRETTY SORE AT APPLE

Real screaming at clouds moment, but word to the wise should anyone accustomed to traditional card behaviors / courtesy’s be considering this Apple Card - I wouldn’t do it again. 

While it’s factually true my $44 payment was past due 30 days and that’s ultimately on me, in my experience other banks/cards escalate with the customer to make sure there’s not a mistake/confusion, before escalating to the credit agencies. 

I called to plea my case, got a perfunctory ‘we’ll open a case,’ and I expect nothing more of it. Other than a bad taste left in my mouth for Apple. 

That said, please feel free to point out where I’m stupid, because I’m sure feeling that way after a dumb $44 phone case only 30 days overdue managed to tank my credit score 100pts. ",2025-04-07 22:27:09+00:00,0,47

I'm surprised to see that Apple Watch is not something that you can select within the Bluetooth list of devices. Only speakers, headphones, car etc. Why would Apple not include this in the Bluetooth devices list for Automation?

I'm trying to make this automation that if my phone were ever snatched from my hand / stolen. And it goes out of range, it would run that automation.

Am I missing something here?

2.4,5 and 6GHz bands enabled.  WPA2/WPA3 security.  Followed the documentation on [6GHz setup on Ubiquiti](https://help.ui.com/hc/en-us/articles/20407971377815-Getting-Started-with-6-GHz#:~:text=WPA2%2F3%20will%20automatically%20be,PMF%2C%20even%20set%20to%20optional).

I'm guessing that since the U6 Pro doesn't have the 6GHz band then ""technically"" all the AP's are not giving out 6Ghz therefore this warning will show.  I haven't ever mixed 6GHz capable AP's with Non-6 GHz capable AP's before but this client had an unused U6 Pro that could not be returned and I figured I'd use it to make the deployment more dense since it was just going to go to waste.  I'm not 100% positive that adding the u6 Pro caused this ""Limited Compatibility"" message but it happened right after the U6 Pro addition.  Thoughts?

1jty3gi,stocks,Apple’s 3-day loss in market cap swells to almost $640 billion,"While the stock market broadly fared better on Monday than in the prior two trading days, Apple got hammered once again, losing 3.7%, as concerns mounted that the company will take a major hit from President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

The sell-off brings Apple’s three-day rout to 19%, a downdraft that has wiped out $638 billion in market cap.

Apple is one of the most exposed companies to a trade war, analyst say, due largely to its reliance on China, which is facing 54% tariffs. Although Apple has production in India, Vietnam and Thailand, those countries also face increased tariffs as part of Trump’s sweeping plan.

Among tech’s megacap companies, Apple is having the roughest stretch. On Monday, the only stocks to drop in that group of seven were Apple, Microsoft and Tesla.

The Nasdaq finished almost barely up on Monday after plummeting 10% last week, its worst performance in more than five years.

Analysts say Apple will likely either need to raise prices or eat additional tariff costs when the new duties come into effect. UBS analysts estimated on Monday that Apple’s highest-end iPhone could rise in price by about $350, or around 30%, from its current price of $1,199.

Barclays analyst Tim Long wrote that he expects Apple to raise prices, or the company could suffer as much as a 15% cut to earnings per share. Apple may also be able to rearrange its supply chain so that imports to the U.S. come from other countries with lower tariffs.

Apple declined to comment on the tariffs.

1jtxyuq,gravesdisease,Thyroid Eye Disease Scanner,"Hi everyone,

I previously posted about my iPhone app that helps measure proptosis in thyroid eye disease. I received great feedback from this community, so I decided to re-purpose the app for patients instead of healthcare providers—and made it completely **free**. It does **not** collect any data or require registration.

In addition to creating a 3D model of the face for measurement, I added features to save measurements and plot changes over time. This allows you to track any shifts in eye position.

**App Store:** [**Graves and Thyroid Eye Disease App**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/graves-and-thyroid-eye-disease/id6744029087)

**Video of the App in Action:** [**Thyroid Eye Disease App in Action**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uckDkf_7GcU)

In order to produce goods here, your standard of living will have to drop significantly. Example: If iPhones were all made in the US, they would cost....

**""In iPhone terms that would bring us to prices in the $30,000 to $100,000 range.""**

[**https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2018/01/17/how-much-would-an-iphone-cost-if-apple-were-forced-to-make-it-in-america/**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2018/01/17/how-much-would-an-iphone-cost-if-apple-were-forced-to-make-it-in-america/)

**That is why production went overseas.**

Trump is telling you how he and Elon will get richer, not you. Already you are buying into the bait and switch he just pulled on you. \[did he tell you he was going to crash the markets? No! You were all going to be rich, there will be peace on earth, and rainbows will come out of your asses\] And now you are lapping up his gaslighting. Will you NEVER learn?!?!

Where is that big wall Mexico was going to pay for? Do you even remember that; his BIGGEST PROMISE the last time? Hell no. You just leap from lie to lie and lap it all up. Damn fools!

PS. So far Trump's tariffs have wiped out **$7 TRILLION IN WEALTH**

LATE EDIT: 

**We are probably in a recession right now**

This morning it was dry and cloudy but PoGo said it was raining. I was going to take advantage of it and use a Meltan box for boosted stats

However now it’s actually pissing rain and PoGo just says “cloudy” so the weather boost obviously changed the Fairy, Fighting and Poison 😒

Is there any way to let PoGo access my weather app? I looked it up on Google but couldn’t find anything. 

It only matches the actual weather about 50% of the time, if that. Any ideas?

When recording what would you say the widest fov would equal to an iPhone camera? Ex: (.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 Etc)

1jtxfgc,iPhone13ProMax,Considering switching to android that’s close to the level of the 13 pro,"I have a iPhone 13 Pro Max 128gb in Alpine Green that Ive had since June of 2022. It’s a good phone but I’m not a fan of the iPhone os, it’s too boring and limited for me. It has overheating issues even when I’m not doing anything heavy intensive on my phone, hot to the point where it stops charging, sometimes I get this device too hot warning which prevents me to use the phone sometimes, and that’s been bugging me. Another thing that has been bugging me is how the touchscreen doesn’t respond to my taps a couple of times, when it gets wet the screen is barely usable, it has some Bluetooth issues with it cutting out in between my earbuds sometimes, and sometimes the picture quality can come off soft. I want to switch to android, that’s within my budget of $300-470 that has great camera quality, a high quality amoled/oled panel, great performance that can hold up for a couple of years, great battery life, doesn’t have any overheating issues, and has good Bluetooth stability and great signal strength which was another complaint I have with my 13 pro max. The phones I am interested in are the s20 fe, nothing phone 2a or 3a, & the OnePlus 12. If any better options in this price range, suggest them below. ",2025-04-07 21:53:10+00:00,0,5

1jtxald,Moissanite,Not Sure Who to Ask,"I'm trying to make a final decision on an engagement ring. I do eventually want to get something custom made in the future, but for now I would like something pretty and affordable. I found a ring that I really liked on Etsy. The seller seems to have good reviews and plenty of those reviews include photos of the ring I like. However, I'm nervous to buy on Etsy because I've seen warnings from others that some ""artists"" will drop-ship cheap rings from Aliexpress and sell them for hundreds more than they're worth. I wouldn't be upset with having a cheaper ring as long as I liked it and it was durable, but I don't want to pay 10x the cost of what it's worth.

It looks like other jewelers on Etsy sell this same ring. I also found a couple of photos of it on Aliexpress (although they are selling it with cubic zirconia). Does this look like other sellers/Aliexpress copying the Etsy seller, or the Etsy seller drop-shipping?

(If I'm asking this question in the wrong sub or if anyone knows another sub to cross post this to I would appreciate it).

1jtx8qr,Comcast_Xfinity,"I’m very, very confused about my bill, and I shouldn’t have a bill at all.","For explainers: I’m a Comcast Now $30/month 100/10 customer. I get an invite to get regular Comcast Internet 300 down plan which comes with a free line on Xfilinity Mobile for a year. So I sign up and go my local Comcast store and get an XB8 modem (lucky!). Soon I get an email that my Xfinity Mobile line has started billing so I need to activate it. My plans are to give the free line to my elderly mother on an unlocked Motorola G Stylus 5G 2024 phone in my drawer. Not surprisingly, Xfinity Mobile says that phone is incompatible, even though Motorola’s website says it is. So until I figure out a different plan, I add the eSIM to my current Verizon iPhone 16 Pro Max as a second line until I can talk to her and see what she wants. Never use it, just storing it. Next day or so, she tells me she doesn’t want Comcast at all. So I go to the local Comcast store, take my XB8 modem up there and ask them to cancel Internet and Mobile, and I’ll re-start my Xfinity Now $30 pre-pay plan, and go back to what I was doing. The Comcast agent in the store was very nice, told me it was less than 30 days so no problem, cancels my Xfinity Internet 300 plan, and then cancels (he said “discontinued”) the Xfinity Mobile line. Now I’m getting an email saying I owe $38.61 (what?). I go to the Xfinity website and login, and I choose the Xfinity Mobile account (ending in 4802) and it says $0.00 due (but it says acct ending in 1555). I go back to that late payment email and I click on Make a Payment and it takes me to a payment page that says my balance so far is $51.93. So far? Are my services for Internet and Mobile (but not Now) canceled? I thought I saw somewhere I was being charged $25.00 for not being an Xfinity Internet customer for a whole 3 minutes. I’m confused.

I’m an old skateboarder, so I like to cruise and carve mostly asphalt.  My board rides great, but I’m considering upgrade with Floatwheel XRV kit, as I’ve heard that it is a huge improvement in power and performance, brighter lights…etc.. So far I’ve avoided the dreaded Haptic buzz update and use only the OWCE app.  The app says I consistently have one cell that is running a bit low at 3.68 vs 3.84 for all the others.  

I have several questions for the community:  I’m a 64 year old baby boomer and NOT computer savvy (I only have an iPhone and iPad and no PC).  From what I’ve read, the Floatwheel XRV kit seems like a good choice for someone like me.  I have no doubts about  my ability to physically install it (because I put in the CBXR and ceramic bearings)…but…IS it difficult to program/configure?…or will the new Float Hub app work for that?  The CBXR was an EXTREMELY tight fit in the stock battery compartment.  Will the BMS component of the XRV kit fit in there ok?   Is my low cell a problem, or will the new BMS help with that?   Is there anyone in the Frederick Maryland area that has experience with this and can assist if I run into trouble?   After the XRV kit is installed, what app do people use when they ride, e.g.  to control lights and see “Duty Cycle”?  I find that the Chi gauge is super useful to visualize “voltage sag” when riding or pulling up hill.  I’m also considering Float Life WTF (standard) rails.

1jtx5ex,R4R30Plus,42 [M4F] France Europe A very open and honest English guy that Is seeking a serious relationship this is a long post!,"
Hi  there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s thats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!
