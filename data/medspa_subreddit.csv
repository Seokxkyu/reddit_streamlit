I am the owner of a software that helps Medspas and clinics create their own custom-branded app. The app allows the Medspas to start/track subscriptions, memberships, let customers order one-time treatments/products, and offer them promotions.

1jvd4d1,MedSpa,Medspa within dr office,"Hi there! Looking for and grateful for any guidance or tips to come my way. I currently manage and market a plastic surgeon’s office. He only performs one type of plastic surgery and does not do any cosmetic injectables. I have been trying to convince him for years to hire an injector and he’s willing to let me run with it. We’re interviewing injectors now, but since this is different than what I’ve been doing, I could use some help. I’m going to convert the one room he uses for consults into a room for the injector.  Injector will be there on days he is not.

1. What EMR system do you recommend?  Don’t want to go absolutely crazy, but also don’t want to get something very inexpensive that’s useless. 

2. I have a list of supplies from an injector. What medical supply company do you like to use?

3. My next step is to contact Allergan and Galderma to see how to go about placing an order. 

4. Is there anything you can tell me that you think I need to know?

1jtuja4,MedSpa,AI for Med Spas? 18yo Builder Seeking Your Industry Pain Points​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ for my aunt 😭🙌,"Hey everyone! I'm 18 years old, and I've been building and engineering things since I was around 14. Over the years, I've gotten pretty good at making different projects using AI—I’ve made some cool things I'm pretty proud of.

My aunt is in the med spa industry, and recently I got curious about how AI and automation might help med spas. I'd really like to surprise her by creating something helpful for her business.

Quick questions for you med spa owners out there:

- Do you currently use AI or automation in your daily tasks? If so, what specifically do you use them for?

- If not, what’s an annoying or repetitive task—big or small—that you'd absolutely love to automate or simplify?

Here are a couple quick ideas I thought up, let me know if they sound useful or not:

- AI voice assistant for inbound calls: realistic conversational AI that answers all phone calls, schedules appointments, and even does client follow-ups automatically.

- Automated text messaging system: sends reminders, answers basic client inquiries, or provides follow-up info.

- AI-enhanced ad campaigns: helps target marketing efforts to reliably generate better-quality leads.

Honestly, not totally sure what's most useful yet (this isn’t my industry, lol). I'd appreciate any insights or thoughts you can share—really excited about the idea of surprising my aunt with something genuinely helpful!

1jtamlj,MedSpa,Marketing Lessons Learned from helping my wife grow her injector business and building a medspa directory,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to share some insights I’ve gained from two key experiences: helping my wife (Spanish speaking) grow her business as an injector and building [**Cuidocs.com**](http://Cuidocs.com), a directory connecting Spanish-speaking patients with medspas and injectors.

These experiences have taught me a lot about the challenges local aesthetic businesses face in marketing—and how collaboration and strategy can help overcome them.

# Economies of scale in marketing matter a lot

One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned is how **economies of scale** impact marketing success. Large companies can afford to invest heavily in branding, advertising, and content creation because they operate across multiple markets, spreading costs across a wider audience. For example:

* Big chains can produce professional video content, run nationwide ad campaigns, and hire specialized teams for SEO, social media, and email marketing—all while staying profitable.
* Local medspas, however, often don’t have the resources to compete at this level. Without the ability to scale across multiple markets, it’s hard to justify the same level of investment.

This challenge is one of the reasons I started Cuidocs. I believe that by creating a network of reliable medspas and injectors, we can replicate the benefits of scale for smaller businesses. By working together under one platform, we can pool resources, share knowledge, and collectively reach more patients—especially underserved groups like the Hispanic community.

# Breaking Down Marketing: Acquisition, Retention, and Referrals

From my experience building Cuidocs and helping my wife with her practice, I’ve found that focusing on three key areas—**acquisition**, **retention**, and **referrals**—is essential for growth:

# 1. Acquisition

* **Google My Business (GMB)**: A well-optimized GMB profile is one of the most cost-effective ways to attract local patients. Include professional photos, bilingual descriptions, and encourage reviews from happy clients.
* **Omnichannel Content Strategy**: Start with YouTube-first organic content (great for education) and repurpose it into blog posts, Instagram reels, TikTok videos, and more. This approach stretches your content further without requiring constant new material.
* **Local Partnerships**: Collaborate with complementary businesses like gyms or salons for cross-promotions or co-hosted events. Be cautious about paying for leads—it’s prohibited in some states due to anti-kickback laws. Instead of paying directly for referrals or leads, focus on mutually beneficial partnerships that involve shared promotions or events rather than monetary exchanges tied to patient referrals.
* **Directories**: Listing your business in specialized directories like Cuidocs can help you tap into new audiences without having to invest heavily in ads.

# 2. Retention

* Use personalized communication channels like email, SMS, or WhatsApp to stay connected with your patients. Share exclusive specials or reminders about follow-up treatments to keep them engaged.
* Always ask for feedback after treatments—it not only improves patient satisfaction but also gives you insights into how you can improve your services.

# 3. Referrals

* Word-of-mouth remains one of the most powerful growth channels in aesthetics. Incentivize referrals by offering rewards (like discounts or free add-ons) for both the referrer and the new client—but ensure compliance with state laws around referral programs. Avoid any structure that resembles paying directly for leads or referrals as this could violate anti-kickback laws in healthcare settings. Instead, focus on creating referral programs that reward loyalty without crossing legal boundaries.
* Make the referral process easy by providing patients with referral codes or links they can share via email or social media.

# Agencies vs Freelancers vs In-house teams

One of the decisions any medspa or injector needs to make is how to handle marketing. Here are my thoughts based on experience:

* **In-House Team**: If you can afford it, having an internal team is the best way for building unique market intelligence tailored to your business. However, this requires significant revenue to support multiple specialists across channels. You can't have one single person to do everything, you need specialists to win. The benefit is complete control over your strategy and a deeper understanding of your ICP.
* **Agencies**: Specialized agencies that focus on aesthetics can be a good option, especially if they limit their client base within your geographic area (so you don't have much competition). They bring diverse expertise and can execute campaigns efficiently, but you may lose some flexibility and personalization.
* **Freelancers**: Freelancers can deliver excellent results at lower costs compared to agencies, but finding the right one takes time. Keep in mind that they may not have the same level of commitment as an employee or agency partner.

If you’re considering doing it yourself, I highly recommend reading *Who Not How* by Dan Sullivan and Dr. Benjamin Hardy. The book emphasizes the importance of finding the right “Whos” to help you achieve your goals rather than trying to do everything yourself—a mindset shift that’s been transformative for me.

If you are interested, I can share a set of interview questions, just DM me. There are so many shady agencies trying to get Medspas and doctors money that deliver poor results. Key questions here is referrals from other clients, their retention and experience in each of the different three key areas (acquisition, retention, referrals).

# Lessons from building Cuidocs

When creating Cuidocs, I realized how underserved the Hispanic market is in aesthetics. Many patients are looking for providers who understand their cultural preferences and speak their language but don’t know where to start. By focusing on education and connecting patients with trusted providers, we’re trying to bridge this gap while helping practices grow organically.

At the same time, Cuidocs aims to give smaller medspas access to scale-like benefits by working together as a network. By pooling resources and sharing visibility under one platform, we can help local businesses compete with larger chains while maintaining their independence.

# Final Thoughts

If you’re a local medspa owner or injector wondering how to balance acquisition, retention, and referrals effectively while staying profitable and compliant, collaboration might be your best path forward.

If any of this resonates with you or you’d like to discuss these ideas further, feel free to comment or DM me—I’d be happy to chat over coffee!",2025-04-07 02:14:41+00:00,4,9
1jt0wl6,MedSpa,Sign the Petition🚨,"--- Letter to the Public Health Committee Chair ----
Mr. Crownover,
Three bills have recently been referred to your committee that could seriously disrupt, if not entirely shut down, many med spas throughout the state if passed in their current form.
As of 2023, there were approximately 2,000 med spas operating in Texas. We estimate these bills would shut down about 90% of those med spas, many of which are Texas small businesses, and put their employees out of work.
All three bills would also take a great leap backward in established medical practice by severely restricting the ability of physicians to delegate to physician assistants (""PAs"") and nurse practitioners (NPs""). These bills threaten patient access, thousands of businesses, and professional autonomy.

1jrst54,MedSpa,MedSpa fraud - Chicago,"
Hi! I’m posting on behalf of my friend who doesn’t have Reddit. She became a client of It’s A Secret MedSpa at the Lincoln Park, Chicago location in October 2024. She paid upfront for the highest tier yearly membership which was over 3,000 dollars. In December the Chicago locations in LP and West Loop abruptly closed, with limited or no notification to staff and clients. She was notified that there would be reimbursement of her unused membership since she paid up front. Upon follow up - my friend has tried emailing the MedSpa and the emails bounce. Contacting them on their listed phone number immediately goes to voicemail. It’s a Secret MedSpa is active on social media and still has 12 locations running in Texas and Arizona. Does anyone have suggestions on how to reach someone? should she reach out to BBB? I can’t imagine she’s the only Chicago client that hasn’t been reimbursed. If you’re considering working or becoming a client in Texas or Arizona with this company… please don’t. Included a screen shot from her old injector. Any advice appreciated ",2025-04-05 02:02:39+00:00,7,3

Unlike traditional directories, it’s not just a listing site—it’s built to actively drive bookings and repeat business through:
	•	Loyalty incentives & special offers to encourage rebooking
	•	Retargeting & dynamic pricing to convert undecided leads
	•	SEO & social media amplification to increase visibility
	•	A two-way marketing portal—more like a consultant than a directory

The “License-to-Hire” Setup That Could Trigger Fines, Audits, or License Loss","If you’re running (or planning to run) a MedSpa in California and you’re not a licensed physician, you’ve probably heard about the MSO-PC model — the go-to structure to keep things legal.

You might think you’re in the clear legally — but there’s a growing number of MedSpas using a structure that **looks compliant on paper** but in practice could be **a ticking time bomb**. It’s called a **“license-to-hire” arrangement**, and if you’re not careful, it could get your business shut down.

Here’s a case study based on a real (but anonymized) agreement we reviewed.

**💡 The Setup**

In California, non-doctors (aka “laypersons”) can’t legally own or control a medical practice — including a MedSpa that offers treatments like Botox, lasers, IV therapy, etc. So instead, the common workaround is to use the **MSO-PC model**:

* The **PC (Professional Corporation)** is owned by a licensed doctor. It provides medical services and employs the clinical staff.
* The **MSO (Management Services Organization)** is owned by the entrepreneur or investor. It provides the space, equipment, admin staff, marketing, tech, and everything non-medical.

Done correctly, it’s legal. The doctor owns the medical practice, and the MSO supports it — charging a fair management fee. But what we’re seeing more often is that these setups are **structured in a way that gives full control to the MSO**, and the doctor is just a name on paper — **effectively “hired” to lend their license.** That’s where the danger lies.

**🚨 What This Looks Like in Practice**

In this example, the MedSpa agreement *looked* like a standard MSO-PC setup. But the details revealed that the MSO had **full financial and operational control** — here’s how:

**🚩 7 Red Flags That Point to a “License-to-Hire” Arrangement**

**1. The MSO collects all patient revenue, deposits it into a bank account it controls, and manages the money.** Although the PC is technically the medical practice, **the MSO handles all payments from patients, insurers, etc.** and deposits them into a business bank account.

**The twist? The MSO has full signatory control over that account.** The doctor can’t move funds, pay staff, or access revenue directly. This gives the MSO **complete financial control** of the medical practice — which is a massive red flag under California law.

**2. The MSO pays itself first, then sends whatever is left to the PC.** Instead of the PC paying a fixed monthly fee for management services, the MSO **takes what it wants first** — rent, equipment use, marketing, admin staff, etc. Only after the MSO is paid does the doctor get any remaining funds. In some cases, the MSO can even raise its own fees at will.

**3. The MSO owns all the critical assets — lasers, office, brand, domain, social media, even the patient phone number.** If the doctor leaves or the agreement ends, they walk away with nothing. The MSO owns the identity of the MedSpa. The PC is disposable.

**4. The MSO can terminate the doctor with just 24 hours’ notice.** Yes — one-day notice. This means the doctor has no real security or stake in the practice. If they’re gone, the MSO just finds a new one and keeps going.

**5. The MSO can migrate all patient records to a new physician of its choosing.** This clause effectively says: if the current doctor leaves, the MSO can assign a new doctor to take over — with access to patient records, staff, and space.

This is **the clearest sign of a license-to-hire** model: the MSO runs the show and just swaps out the licensed provider when needed.

**6. The MSO handles all staffing, HR, payroll, and scheduling.** The PC supposedly employs the nurses and providers — but in practice, the MSO recruits, trains, manages, and even fires them. That’s illegal in California if the MSO is managing *clinical staff* without physician oversight.

**7. The doctor has no say in the business and no real ownership interest.** They don’t control the money, don’t own the brand, don’t hire the staff, and can be removed at any time. That’s not ownership — that’s employment.

Even if the PC is technically in the doctor’s name, the MSO is the one operating the MedSpa.

**🧠 Why This Is a Problem**

Under California law, this kind of setup is considered **illegal lay control of a medical practice**. If the Medical Board, Attorney General, or insurance payers dig into it — and see that the MSO is calling the shots — they could:

* Shut down the business
* Sanction or revoke the doctor’s license
* Issue massive fines
* Investigate for fraud or illegal fee-splitting

Even worse, **any malpractice insurer, landlord, or potential buyer could back out** once they realize the business was structured illegally.

**✅ What a Compliant MedSpa Should Do**

If you’re operating a MedSpa under the MSO-PC model, make sure:

* The physician has **true control** over medical decisions, clinical staff, protocols, and patient care.
* The MSO charges **fair market value** for real services — not a disguised profit share.
* The bank account is **owned and controlled by the PC**, not the MSO.
* The doctor can’t be terminated without serious cause and proper notice.
* The PC is not easily replaced or overridden by the MSO.

A lot of MedSpas in California are unintentionally running illegal “license-to-hire” operations — where the MSO runs everything and the doctor is just along for the ride. That’s not compliant, and it can blow up your entire business. **Structure it right, or risk losing everything.**

**Disclaimer:** This is not legal advice. We are not attorneys, and none of this should be taken as legal guidance. It’s a general analysis based on our own experience working with healthcare lawyers. Always speak to a qualified attorney before making any business decisions involving a MedSpa.",2025-03-22 19:44:57+00:00,5,1
1jgu2ww,MedSpa,How a Non-Doctor Can Open a Med Spa in California (Legally),"Hey everyone,

If you’re a non-doctor (a “layperson”) and you’re thinking about opening a **medical spa in California**, you’ve probably heard about the **MSO-PC model**. I wanted to share a simple breakdown of how it works and why it’s important.

**🧠 The Problem: Corporate Practice of Medicine (CPOM)**

California has strict laws that **only licensed physicians** can own a medical practice. That means:

• You can’t open a med spa and hire a doctor to do Botox.

• You can’t split profits with a doctor from medical services.

• You can’t control how medicine is practiced — only doctors can.

So how do you, a business-minded person, get involved in a med spa **legally**?

**💡 The Solution: MSO-PC Model**

You create **two separate legal entities**:

1. **PC (Professional Corporation)**

• Owned 100% by a licensed doctor.

• This entity bills for and provides all **medical services**.

• Only the doctor makes clinical decisions.

2. **MSO (Management Services Organization)**

• Owned by you (the layperson).

• Provides **non-medical services**: space, staff, equipment, marketing, scheduling, technology, admin, etc.

• You charge the PC a **management fee** for these services.

The PC focuses on patient care. The MSO runs the business side.

**💰 How Do You Make Money?**

You **don’t own the medical practice**, but your MSO charges the PC for all the infrastructure it provides.

For example:

• You rent the office to the PC.

• You lease them the laser machines.

• You license them your website, brand, and software.

• You provide billing, HR, and marketing services.

The PC pays you a **management fee**, ideally structured to reflect the **fair market value** of those services.

That fee = **your profit**.

You don’t “split profits” in the literal sense — that’s illegal. But if you structure the MSO fee right, you can build a business that effectively earns **50% or more of the med spa’s net revenue**, legally.

**🛑 What You CAN’T Do**

• You can’t make medical decisions.

• You can’t tell the doctor how to treat patients.

• You can’t employ nurses or injectors directly unless you’re a licensed medical provider.

• You can’t replace the doctor without a compliant agreement that respects CPOM laws.

**✅ Pro Tips**

• Work with a lawyer who knows **healthcare compliance and CPOM**. This stuff is very state-specific and getting it wrong can ruin your business.

• Use clear contracts: a **Management Services Agreement**, equipment leases, IP licenses, etc.

• Don’t try to “own” the doctor. Let them practice medicine freely — and focus on building a great brand, team, and experience.

Hope that helps someone out there thinking about starting a med spa in CA. It’s totally doable — just gotta do it right. If anyone’s done it and wants to share lessons or mistakes, I’m all ears.

1jf4rn0,MedSpa,Vectus Laser – Why Is It So Painful? Anyone Else?,"Hey everyone,

I'm a spa owner. We recently received a Vectus laser for hair removal - it's almost brand new, and I need some insight because something feels off.

* The **small handpiece** is okay in some areas (like hands), but for most of the body - especially underarms - it’s still **very painful**.

The **cooling system is working**, and the handpiece itself gets cold, so I don’t think it’s a cooling failure. But I’m wondering… is this normal for Vectus, or is there something we’re missing?

1jde8fe,MedSpa,Thinking About Buying a Med Spa? Read This Before You Regret It.,"# Hey everyone—I’ve been seriously looking into buying a med spa, but the more I research, the more red flags I find. It turns out a lot of people buy into failing businesses without realizing it and end up losing way more than they expected.

I figured I’d drop some key things I’ve learned so far—because **there’s way more to this than just checking revenue numbers**.

# 🚨 Biggest Mistakes People Make When Buying a Med Spa

💸 **1. Not Checking the Legal Side First**

* Did you know **in most states, you can’t own a med spa unless you’re a physician?** (Yeah, I didn’t either at first.)
* There are ways around this, like **the MSO model**, but if you set it up wrong, you could lose everything.
* **Some sellers try to make shady “ghost ownership” deals**—which can literally get you fined or shut down.

💰 **2. Overpaying Because of Fake Profits**

* Some owners **run personal expenses** (cars, family salaries, vacations) through the business to make it look more profitable.
* If you’re not adjusting for these, **you might be buying a business that isn’t making nearly as much as it seems.**
* Always ask for **a breakdown of revenue per treatment** (Botox, lasers, facials, etc.)—it helps show what’s actually driving the business.

⚠️ **3. Not Checking Equipment & Licenses**

* **Old or non-compliant laser machines = $$$$ to replace.**
* Some med spas **aren’t even fully licensed**, and you’d be on the hook for fixing it (or getting shut down).
* Always **bring in a med spa consultant or lawyer** to check everything first.

**Here’s a full breakdown of the most important factors before buying a med spa:**

 **Buying a Med Spa? Don’t Do It Until You Know These Key Factors.**](https://dermaskinsolution.com/blogs/insights/buying-a-med-spa-dont-do-it-until-you-know-these-key-factors)



# 🏆 How to Actually Buy a Good Med Spa

🔍 **1. Do a Deep Dive on Financials**

* Gross profit margin should be **60-70%** (if it’s under 50%, *why?*).
* Look at **revenue per treatment hour**—$200-$500 is solid.
* **Client retention** should be **70%+**—if people aren’t coming back, that’s a bad sign.

👩‍⚕️ **2. Make Sure Key Staff Will Stay**

* Most clients are loyal to **their injector, not the business**—so if top providers leave, **so do the customers**.
* **Check employment agreements** to see if they’re locked in or can leave the second you take over.
* Consider **signing bonuses or retention incentives** to keep the best staff.

💼 **3. Negotiate Like a Boss**

* Ask for **a trial period** where the owner stays involved for a few months.
* Structure a **portion of the price as an “earn-out”**—meaning they only get the full amount if revenue stays strong after the sale.
* Get a **healthcare attorney** to review everything (*not just any business lawyer—they need to understand med spa laws*).

# 🔥 Final Thoughts

Buying a med spa **can be an amazing investment**—but **only if you do it right**. A lot of people get caught up in the hype, ignore the details, and end up regretting it.

1j9on7k,MedSpa,Leasing vs. Buying Medical Equipment: What’s the Real Money Move?,"# 

Hey everyone—so, let’s talk about a **hot (and expensive) dilemma**: **Should you lease or buy your medical equipment?**

I’ve seen so many practices **hemorrhaging cash** because they rushed into a bad deal. One wrong move and BOOM—you’re stuck with outdated tech *or* drowning in lease payments that make no sense long-term.

I figured I’d break it down because **this decision can literally make or break your bottom line.**

# 🚨 Buying vs. Leasing: What They Don’t Tell You

💸 **Buying Pros:**  
✅ Own it outright = No monthly payments down the road  
✅ Tax benefits (Section 179 deduction = *big* write-offs)  
✅ No weird leasing contract clauses

❌ **Buying Cons:**  
🚧 Huge upfront cost (and let’s be real, med equipment ain’t cheap)  
🚧 Stuck with outdated machines when new tech drops  
🚧 If patient volume drops, you’re still paying for something you might not need

💳 **Leasing Pros:**  
✅ Lower upfront cost = More cash for **marketing, staff, and expansion**  
✅ Easy upgrades (because tech in this industry moves FAST)  
✅ Monthly payments can be tax-deductible

❌ **Leasing Cons:**  
🚧 Costs more in the long run (you never really “own” it)  
🚧 Contracts can be a nightmare if you need to get out early  
🚧 Some leases charge **stupid fees** for wear & tear

👉 **Still debating?** Here’s a full guide that breaks it all down:  
[**Leasing vs. Purchasing Medical Equipment: Which Option Could Save You Thousands?**](https://dermaskinsolution.com/blogs/insights/leasing-vs-purchasing-medical-equipment-which-option-could-save-you-thousands-2025-guide)

# 🔍 What’s Best for YOUR Practice?

🚀 **Leasing is better if:**  
✔️ You’re in a tech-heavy field (radiology, laser aesthetics, cardiology)  
✔️ You want flexibility to upgrade every few years  
✔️ You’d rather reinvest cash into growing your practice

🏢 **Buying makes more sense if:**  
✔️ Your equipment doesn’t go obsolete quickly  
✔️ You have steady patient volume and predictable revenue  
✔️ You want to avoid long-term financing traps

# 💡 Final Thoughts?

Honestly, **most successful practices use BOTH**—they buy **long-lasting** equipment (like exam tables, ultrasound machines) and lease **fast-evolving tech** (like lasers, imaging devices).

# 💰 The Key to Higher Profits? Your Service Mix

Not all treatments are created equal. Some are **cash cows**, while others barely move the needle:

💉 **Injectables (Botox, fillers)** – 70-80% margin  
🔥 **Non-invasive body contouring** – 65-75% margin

🔬 **Microneedling** – 75-85% margin

# 🚀 How to Boost Revenue Without Raising Prices

* **Package high & low-margin services** (Botox + LED therapy = higher ticket price)
* **Optimize pricing** (charge premium rates for peak hours)
* **Use dynamic pricing** (discount slow days, premium pricing for prime slots)
* **Track provider productivity** (high revenue per hour = higher profitability)

1j8qtd3,MedSpa,At-Home Microneedling vs Professional Microneedling: The Shocking Truth Your Skin Deserves to Know,"# So you’re thinking about microneedling? Cool. But let’s get one thing straight—not all microneedling is created equal.

There’s a big debate in the skincare world: **Is at-home microneedling worth it, or is it just a recipe for skin damage?** The internet is full of influencers swearing by their $30 derma rollers, while dermatologists are out here waving red flags.

If you’ve been asking yourself, **“Can I get pro-level results at home?”** or **“Do I really need to drop $500 on a clinic session?”**, you’re in the right place.

Let’s break it all down—what works, what doesn’t, and what your skin actually needs.

👉 [**At-Home Microneedling vs Professional Microneedling: The Shocking Truth Your Skin Deserves to Know**](https://dermaskinsolution.com/blogs/insights/at-home-microneedling-vs-professional-microneedling-the-shocking-truth-your-skin-deserves-to-know) 👈

# 🚨 DIY Microneedling: Budget-Friendly or a Skin Nightmare?

At-home microneedling has exploded because, let’s be real, **not everyone can afford $300+ per session at a med spa**. The appeal is obvious:

✔ **Cheap** – You can grab a derma roller for $20-100  
✔ **Convenient** – No appointments, just roll and go  
✔ **Privacy** – No awkward convos with an esthetician

BUT (and it’s a big but)… **at-home microneedling has serious risks**.

💀 **Bacteria City** – Not sterilizing properly? Enjoy your infection.  
💀 **Uneven Pressure** – Press too hard, you’re damaging skin. Too light, nothing happens.  
💀 **Wrong Needle Depth** – Most home devices don’t go deep enough for real results.  
💀 **Overuse = Barrier Damage** – You might end up with irritated, sensitive skin that *hates* you.

Sure, **some** people get decent results, but social media doesn’t show the infections, breakouts, and micro-scars from DIY fails.

# 🔬 Professional Microneedling: Worth the $$$?

Let’s talk **why pros charge $200-700 per session**—and why people are willing to pay.

✅ **Medical-Grade Needles** – Sharper, more precise, and don’t tear skin.  
✅ **Adjustable Depth** – Tailored to your specific skin needs.  
✅ **Expertise Matters** – They know *exactly* how to get max collagen stimulation.  
✅ **Sterile Environment** – No risk of using a dirty roller.  
✅ **Pro Serums & PRP** – They use medical-grade skincare post-treatment for *way* better healing.

One **professional session** often delivers **more noticeable results** than **months of DIY treatments**—because the needles actually reach the dermal layer, where collagen production happens.

💡 **TL;DR**: If you’re trying to fix **deep acne scars, wrinkles, or major skin issues**, home rollers **won’t cut it**.

# 💰 The Price Breakdown: DIY vs. Pro

|**Treatment Type**|**Cost**|**Results**|**Risks**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**At-Home Microneedling**|$20-$100|Surface-level, temporary glow|Infection, irritation, uneven healing|
|**Professional Microneedling**|$200-$700 per session|Deep collagen remodeling, long-term improvement|Minimal with proper aftercare|

One thing people don’t consider? **Fixing DIY damage can cost more than professional treatment in the first place**. If you mess up your skin barrier, **you’ll spend hundreds on recovery products, dermatology visits, and regret.**

# 🔥 Making the Right Choice for Your Skin

Still debating? Here’s how to decide:

👉 **Go DIY if:**

* You’re just looking for a small **boost in product absorption**
* You don’t have **serious skin concerns** (scars, deep wrinkles, pigmentation)
* You’re okay with **gradual, mild improvements**

👉 **Go Pro if:**

* You want **real, long-lasting results**
* You have **acne scars, deep lines, or major skin concerns**
* You want a **customized approach that’s actually safe**

If you’re set on **trying at-home microneedling**, at least do it **right**:  
✔ Use a **0.25-0.5mm needle (NEVER go deeper)**  
✔ **Sterilize properly** (70% isopropyl alcohol for 10 mins)  
✔ **Don’t use on active acne** (unless you like infections)  
✔ **Replace your roller every 10-15 uses**

# 🎯 Final Verdict

If you’re **serious about your skin**, **professional microneedling wins** every time. It’s safer, more effective, and **gives you better results in fewer sessions**.

But if you’re just testing the waters and don’t have major concerns, **a careful at-home approach might be fine**—just **don’t expect miracles**.

Your skin deserves the best—**don’t roll the dice on DIY damage.**",2025-03-11 13:32:03+00:00,0,2
1j8ekoa,MedSpa,Seeking Guidance on Frivolous Lawsuit Claim,"I am reaching out for professional advice and support regarding a concerning situation. Recently, I received a letter alleging that I am being sued by an individual claiming damages from a laser hair removal treatment. However, upon reviewing the claim, I discovered several discrepancies:

- The client's name does not appear in my records.
- The alleged treatment date coincides with a day when my business was closed, and I was not present.

Given these inconsistencies, I am suspicious that this claim may be frivolous or even a scam. Unfortunately, the situation has escalated, as the plaintiff's representatives have also contacted the suite owners, who have subsequently suspended my ability to work.

I would appreciate guidance on how to navigate this situation and protect my business. Please let me know if you have any recommendations or can offer support.",2025-03-11 00:52:46+00:00,3,22

We're considering buying a used aesthetic machine like Emsella, BBL, or similar devices but haven't pulled the trigger yet. We're trying to understand the registration process and costs before making a decision.

Some companies seem to demand **tens of thousands of dollars** just to register an account with them if you buy second-hand. Has anyone dealt with this? Is registration even necessary, or can you still operate and resell the machine without it?

Also, do you **need to avoid using their branding** when marketing the device (i.e., not mentioning the company name or machine name)? If so, how do people usually handle that?

And finally - has anyone successfully negotiated the registration fee down? Would love to hear any experiences on whether it's possible to get a better deal.

Is it a really common thing or just something that larger clinics and franchise locations use?

1ipc22s,MedSpa,States are cracking down.....inapprorpiately in some (our) case.,"State investigator just showed up unannounced at a Spa I am medical director at. Bullied his way in past the desk, no clinical people there that day, and decided to tear apart the procedure rooms, opening packages and drawers, taking pictures of everything. This nincompoop who, we later realized, didn't even know what he was doing or talking about, issued a report concluding the spa owner and manager, who performs only non-medical procedures, was ""practicing medicine without a license."" Not even remotely true. We do every single thing perfectly, cross our Ts and dot our i's. Being risk averse myself and my partner spent $7k in (useless) lawyer fees to defend thise nonsense and nothing ever came of it. I am sure the lawyers and investigator are high fiving while they are out to dinner and drinks together. So we're in the hole \~5 figures expenses and lost revenue while we were, self imposed, shut down. Thanks, beloved Government.   
  
Lesson learned: don't let anyone in without a warrant. Don't hire a lawyer unless you are actually being charged with something. Don't shut down unless there is legitimately something wrong. ",2025-02-14 14:42:11+00:00,14,14

I own a wellness center and have been working hard on generating leads from Instagram, but I feel like I’m missing something. I’ve tried:

DMing people with discounted service offers
Posting reels regularly
Running discount and testimonial posts
Boosting reels and static posts
Recently switched to paid ads on Meta
Despite my efforts, I’m not seeing the conversions I’d like. I’ve started running Meta ads, but I want to make sure my ad creatives and targeting are optimized for success.

For those of you who have successfully driven leads from Instagram:

What types of content have worked best for you?
Have you found DM outreach effective?
What ad creatives (videos vs. carousels, UGC vs. polished content) perform best?
Are there specific audience targeting strategies that worked well?
Any advice on retargeting strategies or converting engaged users?

I just opened my clinic (we offer Botox, fillers, laser treatments, etc.) and I’m diving into DIY marketing. I’ve heard so many horror stories about agencies overcharging or underdelivering, so I’m determined to manage my own Meta ads (FB/Instagram) to keep things transparent and budget-friendly.

But honestly? I’m a bit overwhelmed. What’s a realistic Cost Per Lead (CPL) for services like Botox or laser hair removal in this niche? I’ve seen wild estimates online, but I’d rather hear from real clinic owners running their own campaigns.

Could you share your average CPL on Meta Ads? (Even rough ranges help!)  
How long did it take you to optimize campaigns and see consistent results? (Weeks? Months?)  
What’s your monthly ad spend, and how do you allocate it between campaigns?

I’d also love tips on:

* Avoiding common newbie mistakes (I’m already terrified of wasting $1k on bad targeting).
* Creating high-converting ad creatives (before/afters? testimonials?).

Willing to share my journey/data once I get rolling! 🙏 And if you’d prefer to DM, that’s totally fine

1ignu9m,MedSpa,Seeking Recommendations for a Better EMR for My Medspa,"Hi everyone,  

I’m a medspa owner currently using Vagaro, and before that, I used Supersaas.com. I’m looking to switch to a more robust EMR system and would love to hear input from other spa owners.  

Ideally, I’m searching for an EMR that offers:  
- Membership management  
- Rewards program integration  
- Secure storage of client photos and notes (HIPAA compliant)  
- Ability to send clients intake paperwork electronically  

If you’ve had a great experience with an EMR that meets these needs, I’d really appreciate your suggestions! Thanks in advance for your help.  ",2025-02-03 12:22:28+00:00,2,23
1ig8qne,MedSpa,Vagaro does not allow points and discounts to be used,"My brain can't handle this pickle so hoping someone here can offer a solution. I offer memberships where the person banks points each month and the points can be used towards their cosmetic services. I mostly use Jeuveau, which offers the person $40 each visit that I want to offer them. The issue is Vagaro considers the points a discount and they do not allow you to combine discounts, even manually. I've tried multiple ways to enter it to allow the person to receive the rewards. The EMR does not allow a discount greater than the unit purchase price so can't just enter $40 discount and use a code. I want a streamlined process so my receptionist is not doing math at time of checkout.

I've reached out to Vagaro- no meaningful solution other than they will pass it onto the team. 

Jeuveau ""reimburses"" me by giving product for so many treatments logged so I do not want to enter it using the ""other"" payment source  because it will show as revenue.   
  
Right now, the best solution I have come up with is the give them additional 40 points in their bank and apply it at time of checkout. ",2025-02-02 21:50:08+00:00,0,3

Here’s what I’m considering:

* Dermapen Pros: I’ve heard it’s more versatile in offering different treatment types, and I like that it’s plug-in, which seems to ensure consistent precision and depth. The price is also more budget-friendly (about $3,900 for the package I was quoted).
* SkinPen Pros: It’s FDA-cleared, which feels like a gold standard in terms of marketing and patient confidence. It’s pricier (around $6,000), but I’ve heard it’s reliable and well-supported.

My main treatments will focus on aesthetic microneedling and potentially scar revision. I’ll also be combining microneedling with PRF/PRFM for face, neck, and décolletage.

* Does anyone have experience with either device?
* How do they compare in terms of ease of use, patient satisfaction, and long-term durability?
* For those who’ve invested in one, did the price justify the results and ROI?

1htamvw,MedSpa,HiFu/RF devices for spot fat treatment. ,"I know many people, like my mom, does HiFu on her face and neck to tighten sagging sing around her jowls. 

I on the other hand have something different in mind. 
For some background: my weight has fluctuated a bit in the last year or two but in general I would say I’m in good shape and gym regularly focusing on weight training and cardio, however I have always had some stubborn fat/celluclite on my knees which I cant lose no matter how hard I workout my legs. The only time I lost my fat there is when I was borderline anorexic and was underweight. 

So my question is: will a ultrasonic home device work to destroy the fat cells on my legs if I do daily/weekly treatments at home? And what home devices would you reccomend? I’m willing to pay the big bucks if you can attest that the device really works and has a reputable manufacturer. 

Bonus question: regarding home face HiFu devices, do the different light settings e.g blue for acne & collagen production & red for EMS & purple for high intensity - ACTUALLY work? Or is it a marketing technique and its just a lil LED on the device? Or do the lights have a purpose but only on the high end devices?

I am fascinated by the topic of non invasive procedures like this for aesthetics and cosmetic treatments but I also fully support living healthy lifestyles and losing weight sustainability and aging naturally too. 

If this is the wrong sub to ask these questions please direct me elsewhere, but I hope someone can shed some light.

1hrtr8j,MedSpa,What Tools Are You Using to Manage Memberships?,"Hey everyone,

I’m struggling to find a decent membership tool that actually works.   
Acuity is great for booking appointments, but their membership features are just meh.   
Square’s inbuilt membership tool (since they own Acuity now) is even worse.

Zenoti looks like it could do the job, but at $400/month, it’s just way too much for my budget.   
WordPress doesn’t have a straightforward plugin either—it’s all overly complicated or missing key features.

All I want is a simple tool where:

* Users can sign up for memberships.
* They’re billed monthly (on the 1st).
* They can log in to track their perks (e.g., free services, discounts, etc.).
* They get reminders (weekly or monthly).

Does anyone have a system that actually works? Or are you all just biting the bullet and paying for Zenoti?

I currently own a wellness center in Texas where we focus on holistic wellness and recovery. Our services include cryotherapy, IV hydration, saunas, facials, massages, and more. Lately, we’ve been getting a lot of inquiries about aesthetic services like injectables, and I’m seriously considering adding them to our offerings.

Here’s my situation:

My medical provider is my big brother, and he’s fully supportive of the idea. He’s willing to provide his license and supervision while I handle the operational side from A-Z.

However, I’m not sure what steps to take to incorporate injectables into the business.
Specifically, I’d love guidance on:

Getting my brother certified – What certifications or training does he need to administer Botox and fillers in Texas?

Sourcing products – Where do you purchase Botox, fillers, and other supplies?

SOPs and protocols – How do I set up the standard operating procedures to ensure compliance and safety?

1hogks5,MedSpa,Lip Flip or Fillers?,"Lip Flip or fillers?

Hi all. For many years of my teen life and my adult life I’ve always hated my smile. At first I thought it was my teeth but then I realized, my teeth are straight. It’s my lips. My top lip has always folded in any time I smile from a picture. I’ve tried smiling in different ways to correct this now. But when I relax my face my top lip is very thin. Recently I’ve been considering getting either a lip flip or a ml or two to kind of correct the difference in my top and bottom lips. I want to see an esthetician to set up a consultation, but I have a few concerns:

1. Eczema
I do have eczema on my lips, which causes them to peel slightly and chap more easily. It’s mostly my bottom lip that peels and flakes, but sometimes my top lip will also. Will this interfere with the augmentation at all? 

2. Dysmorphia
I hear a lot of stories of people undergoing cosmetic surgery or procedures and getting addicted, next thing they’re undergoing an entire laundry list of cosmetic operations. I’m worried that if I fix my lips, I will pick another one of my features and hyper fixate on it to the point of convincing myself to undergo another procedure.

3. Botox
Botox is commonly used in lip flips. I’m concerned about the safety aspect of it. My smile is already a little droopy. Will it get worse with Botox? Will I still be able to make all my same facial expressions? Does Botox weaken some muscles since it’s used to relax the nerve endings? 

Thank yall in advance

1. How many toxin appointments do you endeavor to fit in a single hour?
2. What margins do you typically target for toxins? (I’m getting to a ~50% assuming 40 units at $12 and 2 appointments per hour)
3. Do you offer patient financing on your toxins?
4. Do you pass along GFE costs to your customers?
5. Do you offer memberships? What other ways are you getting customers to come back?

1het40c,MedSpa,"Interested in becoming a skin care tech? Aesthetician?Lasers,MicroN etc..","(All the ❓️ below are the specific Questions)
Everything else is just me getting deeper into the subject.

So I've been thinking a lot lately on how I don't want to work in retail for the rest of my life.😅 and I've been trying to explore some options on careers i could obtain in a short(er) period of time that i think i would enjoy.

 I currently live in the state of✨️Pennsylvania✨️
(I know different states have different requirements)

Well the thought of being a microneedle technician popped into my mind and I wanted to know if it was like a real job so I looked it up and I saw that you could get certified in that alone??           ‼️‼️  But then I went down the rabbit hole and was thinking I don't think I want to just offer micro needling all in itself I would like to offer and have several different skills such as ‼️
✅️lasers
✅️chemical peels
✅️hair removal 
✅️injections
✅️and other similar skills in that category.

 ❓️(Assuming that the more skills and procedures I'm able to perform, the more opportunity to make $$$$? Correct?)

I'm still not totally sure what education steps I should be taking for this type of thing I keep seeing esthetician and aesthetician pop up on my search engine and for my understanding the aesthetician does more advanced procedures than the other.  
           
❓️Assuming the  skills I mentioned above would be more invasive I'm assuming a aesthetician would be what I'm looking for right? Or is it more along the lines of in order to be one you have to do the other? Becoming Eastician first than continuing to a aesthetician?? 

❓️ what services are you able to perform after acquiring just the esthetician versus the aesthetician certificate by themselves?

❓️Also given that there are actual individual course certifications for the individual skills I mentioned above do I have to take those courses on top of the aesthetician certificate?  

❓️Say i did decide to specialize in just one skill. Whether it be microneedling or tattoo removal or whatever the case may be I asked Google whether or not you had to be an aesthetician prior to taking a micro needle technician course and the first thing that popped up said no but upon further investigation I find that information sorta contradicting.. anyone know the answer? 

❓️I guess in all for what I am asking is what do I need to do to either work in a buisness under the hand of someone else, or possibly even being able to maybe open my own small buisness offering those services someday? Where do I start, where do I go after I start the first step and so on? just in need of someone to break down the basic outline of how to do it step by step, start to certified?  Right now i don't even know where I should begin, and Googles just confusing me further the more I looked into the matter..

❓️ are you able to do these services solely all on your own in a very small designated work space? Like could I set up a sterilized environment  in like a miniature shed , and perform the services all on my own as my own small buisness ? And if the answer is no to certain skills but yes to others which ones are capable of working souly all on your own?

I've been thinking a lot about my future lately and it's actually kind of getting depressing for me I need to make a change in my life or I just don't think I'll ever be happy Within Myself..

1hdof5g,MedSpa,Aesthetics Pro - Awful For Marketing,"We changed to AP about 6 months ago and it has been a nightmare for us as we cannot do ANYTHING with the platform from a marketing point of view and are stuck with awful features that are 15 years out of date.

I have submitted a metric ton of tickets asking for help or features and every time I get a reply that basically says 'we will pass this to our development team'.

My grips:

\-The booking for HAS to be on [Aestheticspro.com](http://Aestheticspro.com) 

|Issue|Why this is important|
|:-|:-|
|The booking for HAS to be on [Aestheticspro.com](http://Aestheticspro.com) |1) We can't add Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, Tag Manager etc. This means we have no way of tracking who is landing on the page for abandoned cart, retargeting, email sequences, SMS follow-up etc. 2) The page cannot be put on our own website so customers leave our website to book = less conversions because of the next issue below.|
|Booking form is 6 pages long and look like a 90s creation!|1) It should be 2 pages (choose appointment & confirmation it is booked), more pages = more abandoned bookings = higher cost of running ads = less profit. |
|Can't use webhooks or API to send info to other platforms|We use High Level for EVERYTHING marketing. The SOLE reason we are using AP is because we have HIPAA compliant forms and EMR. This means we have to manually go into AP, cut and paste data into High Level to allow is to do 3,000 other marketing, CRM and sales things that cant be done in AP. We also cant send any info TOO AP either, so this means we can't get any of the capabilities of AP, unless we manually transfer info. API and webhooks are decades old.... yet they are not a feature|
|No Google Calendar integration|This is insane. Google is HIPAA compliant, yet we have to use the clunky AP calendar and cannot pass appointments back and forth to Google. This means our staff have to log into AP every evening to check their workload. It also means we can't book any clients through High Level, our AI chat or Voice. This is severely limiting our ability to use AP efficiently.|
|No API access|This massively restricts AP utility. Currently we only use it for the forms.... that is it as everything else is done on other platforms|

Has anyone else found a better EMR as we are ditching AP as soon as we find something where the developers will actually develop the platform and take user feedback. 

What works better that you have used from a marketing point of view as I am HATING AP.",2024-12-13 22:42:28+00:00,6,26

BACKGROUND (skip if you like).  I've been an NP for 6 years, RN for 13.  With incentives and OT, I will make about 150K at my full-time gig in Urgent Care this year.  It's not a bad gig.  I have good benefits, big hospital system, and I like my coworkers.  BUT, it doesn't matter if I see 35 patients or 48 patients (12 hours).  It doesn't matter that I get great reviews.  I'm slowly drowning in patient volumes and demand for healthcare, and it's time for the care I provide to mean more :-)

I don't know if I will make more or less as a MedSpa owner.  I am currently talking with Moxie and Portrait and getting my tox and filler certification this week.  I have been practicing on myself (is that normal LOL?).  I've watched probably a hundred hours of training on YouTube.   

THE QUESTION: Money isn't everything to me, but can anyone share with me experiences and general figures on their salary as an NP or PA MedSpa owner?  I am in Indiana (Carmel, which is an affluent area).  Tox goes for about $10 per unit here.  Filler about $600 ish per syringe. I don't think I will do laser treatments (but I  might).

I will take ANYTHING that anyone has to offer in the way of information/advice/encouragement/discouragement.  I'm not looking for people to say DO IT.  Feel free to say DONT DO IT.  Feel free to say literally anything.  

If I am successful, I will pay it back to the community in the way of doing the same thing for the next generation.

I noticed a lot of people were looking to get interested in Botox/Filler and research courses. 

We created a completely online course designed to provide all the essential information to get started. This course is a great introduction for those considering signing up for those intensive two day courses that really pack in information. 

Right now we are leaving the course free for a limited time to allow for people to try it out. We currently are not offering continuing education credit but plan to offer it in 2025 as well as provide a short reference guide.

1gy9ojr,MedSpa,Switching from Mangomint to potentially Zenoti or Meevo,"I’m considering switching from Mangomint to Zenoti and wanted to ask if anyone here has honest feedback about Zenoti. I currently have two locations and pay nearly $600/month for Mangomint, but I’m finding it harder to justify the cost.

I’ve loved Mangomint for its simplicity, but there are some pain points: the reporting isn’t useful, there’s no dashboard, and their refusal to integrate with apps that drive traffic and appointments is frustrating. Features like forms and marketing are silly expensive, and two-way texting is an additional $75/month. Over the years, it feels like they’ve nickel-and-dimed us with add-ons instead of bundling features into the price. For the money I’m paying, I shouldn’t need my team to manually compile reports just to make the data useful. The lack of support for a referral or rewards system is also limiting.

Zenoti, on the other hand, seems to be on the cutting edge, especially with its AI-first approach. I’m excited about features like Hyper Connect and seamless integration with Meta and Google Book Now links. It also seems like the reporting and automation tools are much better. I see AI as the future, and Zenoti feels more aligned with where I want my business to go.

That said, I’m worried Zenoti might not deliver everything it advertises. If you’ve used Zenoti, I’d love to hear your thoughts—what’s great about it, and what’s not so great? Does it live up to the hype? Thanks in advance!

Right now, my second choice would be Meevo. I really liked their reporting and the dashboards they have, but Zenoti feels more cutting-edge to me.  ",2024-11-23 20:58:21+00:00,3,32
1gwzio7,MedSpa,Med Spa vs Medical Spa vs Medi Spa - What to use?!,"Have you done thorough keyword research **before** writing content for your website, your GBP etc? 

Even the most common and most obvious keyword of Medical Spa sometimes can trip you up if you're not careful!

Take this screenshot below as an example of our target keywords for the homepage.

1)  In Phoenix, there's almost TWICE as many people each month searching for ""med spa"" than there are for ""medical spa"", so we obviously want to focus on targeting and ranking for ""med spa"" in this city.

2)  In Seattle, it's the opposite. There are more than twice as many people searching for ""medical spa"" vs ""med spa"".

It's HIPAA compliant and a team of doctors are issuing the prescriptions in the backend. They can also do intake consultations. Prescriptions are shipped by a pharmacy. So the licensing requirement is complied with if there is a team of Drs issuing it. 

  
I'm curious if this is something medspa owners would want to expand their practice? Prescriptions are filled out by Drs anyway, and meds are shipped by a pharmacy. I imagine after the body contouring, it can be upsold to those who might want to achieve their goals faster.

I'm helping someone buy a Med Spa and I'm curious how you handle your bookkeeping. Whether you're just starting out or managing a well-established spa, keeping your finances in check is critical for growth.

Here are a few questions to get the conversation started:

* Do you manage your bookkeeping in-house with your team (insourced)?
* Have you decided to work with an outsourced bookkeeper or accounting firm?
* What factors influenced your decision, and are you happy with it?

Some key considerations might include cost, expertise, data security, or how much time you want to spend reviewing financials yourself.

Has anyone ever financed med spa equipment and not been able to make the payments? If so, how were you able to get through it?

1gof8m7,MedSpa,Lots of Declined CareCredit Applications,"I recently acquired 2 medical spa practices in northern CA. The majority of our customer base isn't very wealthy - it ranges from people who can't put food on the table to middle class customers. As such, offering patient financing solutions is hugely beneficial - it's a lot more palatable to sell a package as $150 / month for 24 months vs. $3,600 today. One of our locations does exceptionally well, and the second location has been getting good demand, but has been getting destroyed on rejected CareCredit applications. 

Our business relies on the sale of packages, so it's really frustrating when people who want to buy large packages can't because they're getting rejected for financing solutions. I was curious if any other medspa owners have done to navigate these issues? 

As an FYI, we also offer layaway options (i.e. some amount down and then the remainder is paid in future appointments), but some customers just don't have the cash. We are also onboarding PatientFi (but I assume it's just as difficult to get approved), and Cherry won't work with us right now because they previously terminated the relationship with the prior owners of our practices.

No difference in approval rates or else we would’ve seen a change in the close rate. That’s exactly the same.

Only thing I can think of, is when the feds lowered the rate, the BNPL companies increased the loan size to make up for the difference.

Anyone else seeing this as well?

Advertising for a sale (prospects are directed to your website where they book themselves)

vs

Advertising for leads (gathering the prospects contact info to call/message to book in manually)

Personally, I have mainly only advertised for the sale, not sure if it would be worth it for all the extra labor for working leads, following up, etc. But I can see leads making sense when its a certain service that they may need extra information on, or an extra push. Such as more advanced (and expensive) treatments such as laser, rf microneedling, etc.

Currently we are transitioning into a full medspa, so we offer pretty much all esthitician services right now, mainly facials/hyrofacials type services. So this idea of sales vs leads might be service-dependent.

However I am attempting to make the facials more so into skin rejuvenation programs, where they essentially prepay for 4-6 months of treatments to achieve their goal, rather than individual facials, an offer like this might benefit more from a lead-type campaign.",2024-10-07 23:14:18+00:00,1,10

I’m curious if any nurses or PAs out there can shed insight as to if this is even an opportunity they would be interested in.

1fvayan,MedSpa,Starting a Business with No Client Base,"Hello all current med spa owners!

So I would like - as many of us have - to open my own med spa. I'm located somewhere where the market is definitely oversaturated, but I have a unique concept that I think there's a pretty huge need for in my area. I am also a licensed esthetician, but I have not practiced in my state, as it's one of few in the country that require secondary licensure to actually make the career worthwhile. This means that while I have the skill set, I don't have an existing client base.

So my question is this: how many of y'all have opened a successful, stable business without having your own clients to transition in, vs how many of y'all just opened a business without established clients and have been successful?

In order for me to effectively practice as an esthetician in the state I'm in, I would have to go back to school for another 600 hours, and esthetics school was not kind to me the first time around. So while I will obviously do it if necessary, I would like to avoid it at all costs.

1fi86xu,MedSpa,Is this normal from a med spa doctor?,"A little backstory - I live in a very rural area. I travel 1.5 hours one way to go to a med spa. She just opened her business last year. I started seeing her for botox as the other woman I used to go to moved. First issue - she forgot to log in my appointment on my Alle app for my injections. I sent her a text letting her know I noticed it wasn't logged in and she said it can take a day to show. When it finally got logged, it was for the wrong date. I'm guessing she forgot to do it and did it once I messaged her. Oh well, not a big deal. She's very nice and we're all human. She ended up doing the same thing at my next two appointments. Once again, not a big deal, so I just dealt with it.

I wanted to try tirzepatide, so I asked her if she had access to it. She told me yes and I set up an appointment. She did blood work, I paid her $1500 for 3 months, and I was so excited. She didn't seem to know much about the dosing and kept saying she'd talk to the pharmacist. The problems started when I would need a refill. I would text her I'm out and need a refill, she'd tell me she'd call it in, but then she never would. I'd have to remind her for her to do it. I'm on my third month and I texted her letting her know I was out. She never responded. A couple days later I called the pharmacy to see if they shipped it and found out she never called it in and the pharmacist told me they have a hard time getting orders from her. I messaged my provider again telling her they never got it and that I'd like to go up to the next dose (I had been on the second to smallest dose for almost 6 weeks). Still no response.

I ended up having a consult with a different, amazing med spa that does things all online and I paid for the medication that day. They also didn't need any labs done. My original provider finally messaged me back saying she was gone all week and she just got my messages. I feel like that's not a good excuse as I texted her cell phone and the fee I paid her was supposed to include having the ability  get ahold of her if I ever had any questions. I never messaged her outside her business hours. She also made me come in for blood work every month and charged me $100 each time. And would never let me know my results, I would have to call her to get them. So, I was basically paying her $600 a month for not good service.

Oh, and I made an appointment for botox back in June because I had to drive over to that town anyway. I showed up and she told me I didn't need any and wouldn't do the injections for me 🙃 She gave me 6 units because I told her I felt like I needed them done. The 6 units did nothing. Keep in mind, I live 1.5 hours away and I didn't know when the next time I'd be over there was. It was over 3 months from my last appointment which is what I typically do. I was just shocked she told me no after I scheduled an appointment and went there to get it done. I haven't been back to her for Botox since.

I still have one month left on the tirzepatide I paid her for and I'm not sure what to say. I'd like my last month, but I already switched to another med spa. I thought about letting her know that I switched due to convenience, but I'd like to get my last month's worth of medication since I paid for it. But I'm not driving a total of 3 hours to pay $100 and get more lab work done.

She's a very nice lady, so I don't want to hurt her feelings. I'm a very understanding person, but it's been a frustrating experience 🙃 Any advice on how I should handle this?

I was wondering if I could get some guidance or a how to guide on how to set up a professional corp for an IV hydration business. A lot of law firms offer services to set this up for like $2,000 and I’m not sure if that is 100% necessary or is this something you can do on your own?

I know a physician has to own 51% but where does that part go in the filing process. I am an NP myself.

1fg38v5,MedSpa,Compensation feedback/advice,"Compensation for Lead Aestheticians – Hourly Pay & Performance-Based Structures?
Hey everyone! I’m curious about what you’re paying your lead aestheticians in terms of hourly pay and performance-based payout structures. I understand that laws and regulations around what aestheticians can perform vary widely from state to state, so I’ll include relevant duties specific to my situation:
- Operating laser and light-based devices
- Dermaplaning/microdermabrasion
- Medium-depth chemical peels
- Traditional and radio-frequency microneedling
- Licensed phlebotomist for PRP treatments
- Routine room turnover and cleaning duties
- Occasionally handling receptionist tasks
For context, I’m currently the solo aesthetician at a well-established medspa that’s been in business for 17 years. Our team consists of three people—the receptionist, myself, and the medical director (who handles injectables and is on-site one day per week).
Looking forward to your feedback! Thanks 😊",2024-09-13 19:28:00+00:00,1,0

1ffml1w,MedSpa,Building owner being paid in equity or % of gross profit?,"What would be a fair equity stake in a brand new med spa business for the owner of the building to be paid in lieu of monthly rent? 

Average commercial office space go for around $25/SF per year in my area. There’s a lot of empty space available so I can build out my office as big or small as I’d like. According to google the average med spa is 2000-3000 square feet which would put my lease to around 50-75k per year. 

The idea of not having to worry about high overhead when building up my business intrigues me but I want it to make sense and be fair for both parties. 

If you were in a position where you had this option as a new med spa owner would you take it?

I’m thinking something like 10% of yearly gross profit or 15% of gross profit if owner also pays for upfront remodeling costs. Or perhaps a mix of like 10% equity and 5% yearly gross profit?

The owner of the building owns the medical practice on the first floor and so I would like him to have some skin in the game so I can leverage his knowledge and existing infrastructure/contracts/vendors. But I also don’t want to feel pressure to start pulling money out of my business so my now business partner is made whole on his initial investment. 

If any of you have any thoughts or past experiences you can share I’m all ears!

1eu1qqb,MedSpa,I'm a CMO of a med spa & our clinic generates $260K/m in sales!,"I'm a CMO of a med spa & in 1 year, our clinic went from $0 to $260K/m

Here's how I did it...

Many clinics around us are still running the old stock image ads to booking page.

  
That worked in 2020, but not today.

  
So we focused on value-first ads, which lead with education first.

  
This was especially helpful to get semaglutide ads up since we are not legit script certified 

  
In my experience working with a lot of clinics, we typically do not have a ""lead"" problem

  
Although we might try to think so...

  
We typically have a human capital problem by means of not having the right front desk staff in place.

  
We heavily incentivize our team to book appointments, and we hire/fire quickly to find individuals who adopt this mentality...

We call every lead to get these 3 things

1. Yes

2. No

3. F\*ck Off

  
If you get nothing, you have not followed up enough…

  
Focusing on TOF ads and Human capital has led us to achieve $260K/m in sales and $58,000 a week in sales!

Another big driver for us is memberships, which cost around $40K in monthly recurring revenue.

1. We have about $5k to buy equipment straight away
2. We have an advanced aesthetician on staff and currently only offer laser hair removal, VI Peels, jelly facials and other basic facials.
3. We want to have the option to become an aesthetician only business if we can't turn up the injectables profits in the next few months. So we would need services that are not reliant on injectables.
4. We are looking for popular services that are high-profit and ideally don't require a huge outlay up front.

We are struggling to make the injectables side of the house work as the margins are so thin and labor costs so high. We have tried for a year now and it is tough...

What would you recommend?

Why do you recommend those services?

What is the approx price and profit margins?

Any other help, advice or tips are greatly received as we are struggling right now after a tough summer.",2024-08-13 05:12:24+00:00,2,1

1el1gnq,MedSpa,Why do so many MedSpas treat their operation like it's not a business?,"Is it because many medspa owners or managers come from medical or aesthetic backgrounds rather than business ones?

1el0lxm,MedSpa,Aesthetic Manufacturers' Dirty Little Secret ,"In today's growing field of aesthetic medicine, there’s an inconvenient truth that many practitioners discover too late. Aesthetic manufacturers, in their relentless pursuit of profit, often show little regard for their primary customers—the small and mid-sized medspas. This disregard manifests in ways that not only squeeze the little guy but can also lead to financial ruin.

**The Role of Consumables with Aesthetic Devices**

Medical device consumables are a lucrative revenue stream for manufacturers, who require the use of single-use consumables for many aesthetic treatments. These include items like Coolsculpting coolcards, Emsculpt Neo paddles, microneedling tips, and Fraxel tips. It's not enough that the laser manufacturer sells you an expensive device, priced at anywhere from $100,000 to $250,000. Their business model is designed to ensure they continue to profit from you every time you treat a patient.

The recurring costs of these consumables can make it extremely difficult for smaller medspas to turn a profit. While this model may be sustainable for large, high-volume practices, it leaves little room for smaller operations to thrive. This constant drain on resources can be particularly challenging in the already competitive world of aesthetic medicine.

**Device Manufacturers Are Squeezing the Little Guy**

Manufacturers often rely on influential medical luminaries to promote their devices. These doctors, with large and successful practices, often receive equipment at significantly reduced costs or even for free. In return, they conduct research, treat patients, and present their findings at industry conferences.

Smaller practices, attending these conferences, look to these luminaries for advice and guidance, often purchasing devices based on their recommendations. However, these smaller medspas lack the patient base and brand recognition of their celebrity counterparts. They struggle to attract patients and make a profit, signing lease agreements with large monthly payments that can quickly become unmanageable.

Many practitioners entering the aesthetic space come from primary care backgrounds and lack specialized training in dermatology or aesthetics. They often receive minimal training on the equipment, making it even more challenging to establish themselves in the market. Despite these obstacles, they represent the ""bread and butter"" target customer for aesthetic manufacturers due to the sheer number of installs they represent.

**Manufacturers Oversell Their Devices and Saturate the Market**

Manufacturers relentlessly pursue sales, often with little regard for market saturation. They sell as many units as possible, knowing that not all practices will succeed. This approach leads to a saturated market where many medspas struggle to differentiate themselves and attract enough patients to stay afloat.

Adding insult to injury are the ongoing consumable costs required for each treatment. After months or even years of struggling to make a profit, many practices ultimately give up and close their doors. They are then forced to sell their overpriced equipment at a significant loss.

**The Recertification Fee is the Nail in the Coffin**

The final blow comes when medspa owners realize that the devices they paid so much for have plummeted in value due to the manufacturer’s recertification fee. This fee, often $40,000 or more, must be paid by the new buyer for the manufacturer to support the device. This effectively makes it nearly impossible to resell the equipment without incurring substantial losses.

In summary, the deck is stacked against small and mid-sized medspas. Manufacturers, having made their money through initial sales and ongoing consumable fees, show little concern for the financial well-being of their customers.

**There is a Better Way**

Device manufacturers must eliminate the recertification fee. Most practitioners are unaware of this fee when they purchase new aesthetic devices, and it significantly devalues the equipment when it can't be resold easily. Medspa owners should negotiate this fee out of the original purchase agreement.

For those looking to buy an aesthetic device, the best strategy is to avoid buying new. Wait 12 to 18 months and purchase the device used—you'll save at least 50%. When buying used, ensure you can order consumables from the original owner's account to avoid the recertification fee.

It's time for the aesthetic industry to prioritize the success and sustainability of all its practitioners, not just the big players. By making smart purchasing decisions and demanding fair practices from manufacturers, medspa owners can level the playing field and thrive in this competitive market.

1ejn532,MedSpa,Interested in medspa for chiropractor ,"I am a chiropractor looking to branch out a bit and get another revenue stream. I’m interested in medspas in the state of Massachusetts. I focus my chiro practice on women and pregnancy. We already do quite a lot with nutrition and offer a few supplements that I highly believe in the efficacy of. 

I’m thinking about including massage and acupuncture which would be adjunct contracted workers with their own business under the same roof as mine so to speak. Then I’d be interested in adding in something like facials, IPL, derm laser, and Botox or fillers. 

I’m really not sure if any of those things are possible for a chiro in Massachusetts. This is my very first research into the possibility. 

Specifically, I am very interested in the laser skin treatments and IPL. I personally have suffered with rosacea and found lasers and IPL to be hugely beneficial.  Im very interested in finding out more about the purchase and training for a V-Beam laser or something equivalent and or an IPL machine. I truly do not know much about the topic so please excuse my ignorance if these questions are fundamentally inappropriate. 

Also, I’ve personally used Botox in the forehead and “between the eyebrows” area to help with wrinkles but also noticed how much it helped my tension headaches. I’ve often thought this could be a huge help to many of the women I treat.  Also does anyone know about the use of Botox for TMJ and how would I go about getting trained for that? Is it included under cosmetic medspa or would you need an actual physician with the specialty?

For reference, in the state of Massachusetts, a chiropractor is considered a portal of entry physician. I have a doctorate. 

Any info is greatly appreciated! Thank you! ",2024-08-04 04:49:08+00:00,0,7

1ej3ha0,MedSpa,Best All-In-One Software Medspa Software?,"Looking for best software for appointments, payments, CRM, memberships, loyalty program, etc. We currently use:

**Scheduling: Acuity**

**Payments: Square/Stripe**

**CRM: Hubspot**

**Loyalty/Memberships: Square**

Looking for a software that can combine these, to provide more sophisticated features. For example, we want to require a 50% deposit for bookings, which square cannot do, but our scheduling app Acuity CAN do. However, the two don't necessarily communicate. So if they pay half when they schedule on acuity, square doesn't know that info, so after their appointment, the service provider then has to first look at acuity to see how much they paid. 

Which isn't too big of an issue, but then if they want to use their loyalty points, discount, etc, they cannot do so when scheduling, and when they use it for the remaining balance after their apt, it would only apply to 50% of their total transaction. 

Price is not really a constraint, we just want the absolute best platform.

From my point of view, I would rather pay a higher base pay rather than commission. So either all base pay and no commission, or around 10%. 

To me this seems beneficial to both parties as the estheticians will not have as much fluctuation in income, and as the spa owner we can have higher margins on premium services, without taking a cut on the top line before even factoring any operating expenses. Especially so that we can market for client acquisitions.

1e0qbcp,MedSpa,Seeking Career Advice: From Software Engineering to Med Spa Ownership,"I am passionate about aesthetics and the science behind anti-aging, and I'm considering a major career shift. I have a BS in Software Engineering, but I'm deeply drawn to the aesthetics field. My ultimate goal is to own a med spa.

I'm at a crossroads, though. The traditional path of becoming an esthetician doesn't appeal to me much, as I find it less academically rigorous than I'd prefer. I've always loved having engaging discussions with NPs about cutting-edge research in aesthetics. I really don't want to go back to college. Also my husband doesn't want me to fall into the trap of overeducating myself and not actually getting experience. 

Here are my options:

1. Should I consider becoming an esthetician anyway, even though I'm not enthusiastic about it?
2. Would working at a med spa (perhaps at the front desk) to learn the business ins and outs be a viable way to eventually partner with an NP and open my own place?
3. Or, should I pursue an accelerated nursing program to become a Nurse Practitioner, aligning more with my love for science and rigorous education? I feel like this would take so long. I wish I had done this as my major rather than software.

1dyi4kk,MedSpa,Struggling with an Unresponsive Medical Director in Our Bay Area Med Spa – Need Advice!,"Hello everyone,

A year ago, my family purchased a Med Spa located in the Bay Area, and I've been tasked with managing it. Despite being entrusted with the day-to-day operations, I have very little power when it comes to making final decisions, which are controlled by my parents. I’m a Computer Science student and not a licensed healthcare professional, making this situation feel even more out of my reach.

Our spa offers a variety of treatments, including Dermal Fillers. We are running critically low on Hylenex and urgently need a prescription from our Medical Director (MD). Unfortunately, our MD has been consistently unresponsive to our simple requests for signatures and prescriptions – tasks that take merely minutes to complete.

Our MD has been with the Med Spa for 2 years, a requirement imposed by the previous owner (a close friend of the MD) in the purchase agreement. We've had issues with the previous owner, but that’s a separate issue. Despite my efforts to seek advice from our staff and my healthcare professional family members, their guidance has been limited and insufficient. Extensive research has not provided me with a clear path forward.

I’ve considered alternative sources like Korean and European Hyaluronidase brands, but I’m unsure of their legitimacy and safety.

Here are my pressing concerns:

* How do I handle an unresponsive MD who neglects their roles and responsibilities?
* How can I verify the legitimacy and safety of international Hyaluronidase brands?
* How can I make meaningful contributions to the Med Spa as a non-clinician and technically a mere employee, especially with the final decisions being out of my hands?

I feel overwhelmed and powerless in this situation and would greatly appreciate any advice or insights from those who have navigated similar challenges or have experience in the med spa industry. Thank you for your time and support.",2024-07-08 19:46:18+00:00,5,12

Occasionally I’ll run into the other providers I’ve seen who always seem surprised to see me there. I might be overthinking this but I’m wondering if I’m supposed to pick one person in particular and go to them for everything, or if my approach is common and no one cares.

1d81q5y,MedSpa,Do before & afters attract clients to your Med Spa nowadays? ,"Every Med Spa has the same Instagram. Before & After, discounts, promos. It doesn't work anymore. 
That's why you guys are getting dms like "" How much"" or "" can I make an appointment "" and they ghost you immediately. 

Med Spas do not provide anything exclusive. Every clinic has same botox from Alle, Emsculpt from BTL and Fillers from Juvaderm. 

Your before and afters are expected to look good. Nothing special about it. 

So how do you get clients to you med spa, gain trust and become a primary choice in your area?

I'll share two strategies that work for our clients ( And yes, we are marketing company) 

1. Google
I don't care how much you hate SEO & Google and collecting reviews, your potential clients are searching for ""botox injector near me"" ""microneedling + ""city name"" and much more. 

These are the people that already did their research and ready to buy. However if your med spa is not showing within top 3 on Google, you can forget about getting a call. So make sure your med spa ranks. 

2. Social media. 

Humor works best. Show that you are a human being with feelings. Show people that you like movies your audience like, food or anything else that will click with them. They will come to you, rather than to a stranger with nothing but a bunch of before and afters on their page. There's a reason why Dr. Miami and few others do not post their work much. 


Hope it was somewhat helpful. Post what has worked for your practice.

I’m an operations/office manager at a well known medical spa. My main responsibilities are day to day operations, staffing, scheduling etc. Your typical office manager duties. But the specific company I’m with also has the ops managers do the consultations instead of having in office consultants. Was a bit weird when they told me this but I’m like whatever. I’m a few months in and I just started conducing the consultations and the process of how it’s supposed to be is I chat with them about their goals, what their interested in etc. Then I bring in a medical provider to do their physical assessment (ie. See how many units of Botox they need, look at their fat to see how many cycles of fat freezing they need etc) Then based off of their assessment, I go back in after and quote them based on what the nurse advises. This is where it gets weird. There’s some days where we don’t have a nurse in the building due to staffing challenges so we just focus on admin tasks. Higher ups say I can still conduct consultations by myself and do the physical assessments myself on those days? This makes me uncomfortable because I’m not a medical provider and my role is specifically to just make friends with these clients and go over their finance and loan options. If you were a client coming in for a consultation, would you be a little off put if a manager was the only one involved in your entire consultation and basically “guessing” how much of something you need and not have a medical provider get a say at all? Am I overreacting over this? For one, I’m confused on why I have 2 roles to begin with. I’m supposed to be an operations manager, not a consultant. I should have a separate person conducting consultations, that’s how any other practice works. But I got over that, and now dealing with being told I can basically do a physical assessment on patients that only medical providers usually do. Wtf?

I've found an owner looking to sell, and I'm at the stage where I'm reviewing their financials (balance sheet, income, PnL, etc).

I have a good understanding of finances, but would love help from someone that has the experience in recognizing well run spas, understands what good numbers should look like. In addition, general help in the acquisition process would be a bonus!

Please feel free to DM me or leave a response here. Any engagement is much appreciated!",2024-04-15 16:02:50+00:00,1,3
1c1107g,MedSpa,My Medspa is Failing. I need advice.,"Hello all medspa owners,

I come here looking for help and, honestly, I'm so embarrassed about my situation that I've created a throwaway account to post this.

In mid-2023, I took a significant step and opened a medspa, investing over $150,000 through loans. The location is in a bustling area of Newport Beach, CA, a place with high demand for Botox treatments—truly a Botox hotspot.

Our services include hydrafacials, fillers, Botox, and we also have a few laser machines on site.

However, we're facing a dire situation. For the entire month of April, we've only had 1 patient. In March, only 9 patients walked through our doors. While 2023 started somewhat promisingly with some referrals, we've only managed to attract around 10 patients a month on average.

I'm at a loss and don't understand what I'm doing wrong. I'm reaching out for your guidance and advice on several fronts:

1. Patient Acquisition: It feels like every marketing agency overpromises and underdelivers. How are you successfully attracting new patients?
2. Managing Costs: With the high cost of products, I'm struggling to maintain a profit margin. How do competitors manage to get such substantial discounts?
3. SEO and Online Presence: I'm unfamiliar with SEO strategies and need guidance. Our website is aesthetically pleasing, yet it fails to attract traffic. How do you manage to get noticed on Google?

I'm earnestly requesting your help to point me in the right direction. Please share your insights and advice.",2024-04-11 00:13:41+00:00,72,47
1c0qjp7,MedSpa,How much is your practice making? How much should you be making?,"Let’s sprinkle some numbers with a dash of insight, shall we?

**If You’re Just Starting Out...** Buckle up, buttercup! Your sparkling new medspa might be pulling in anywhere from $200k to $500k in annual revenue if you’ve:

* Got a prime location that doesn't scream ""Where am I?""
* Perfected that secret sauce of a compelling service menu (think facials that make you feel like a unicorn just blessed you).
* Managed to create an Instagram feed where every before-and-after is a swipe-right.

**Cruising Along in the Medspa Middle Lane...** Now, if you’ve been at this for a bit (let’s say 2-5 years), and you’ve got a solid crew of 10-15 employees who know a dermal filler from a donut filler, you’re looking at that sweet spot of $500k to $1M. To hit these numbers, you're probably:

* Hosting Botox parties that are the toast of the town.
* Selling skincare products that even the goddess of youth would endorse.
* Watching clients book their next appointment before they've even peeled their blissed-out selves off the treatment bed.

**The Seasoned Pro Zone...** With 5+ years under your belt and a tribe of 15-25 employees, you’re the zen master of the medspa world. You’ve got a lineup of services that could make the Sistine Chapel ceiling look plain, and you're raking in $1M to $2M. Here’s why:

* Your membership program is so good, even coffee shops are taking notes.
* You’ve got more 5-star reviews than there are stars in the sky (okay, maybe a slight exaggeration).
* Your brand is so strong, it could arm-wrestle Hercules and win.

**The ""I've Got This"" Sweet Spot...** When your medspa is such a local staple that it practically deserves its own holiday, you’re likely pulling in $2M+. At this stage:

* Your staff is so efficient, they run on espresso and excellence.
* Your clients consider your medspa their second home, and you’re considering charging them rent.
* Your monthly revenue charts look like a graph of Mount Everest - only up!

Now, these numbers aren't set in stone—much like your clients' faces post-filler. The reality is, profitability can be as varied as skin types walking into your spa. And EBITDA? Let's aim for 15-20% when you're established. But remember, that’s more of a ""guideline"" than a ""rule"".

**Revenue and Profit Averages:**

* The average revenue for a medspa in the U.S. can vary widely based on location, services offered, and client demographics. On average, a well-run medspa can generate between $1 million to $3 million in annual revenue.
* Profit margins can range from 10% to 25%, largely depending on the cost controls, types of services offered, and operational efficiency. Highly successful medspas might push towards a 30% margin.

**EBITDA and Margin Benchmarks:**

* EBITDA, which stands for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization, is a measure of a company's overall financial performance. For medspas:
   * New medspas (1-3 years) may see EBITDA margins of around 10-12%, as initial investments and marketing costs can take a significant bite out of profits.
   * Established medspas (3+ years) should aim for an EBITDA margin of around 15-20% or more, as they have had time to streamline operations and build a client base.

**Profitability Tips:**

* **Service Mix:** The highest profit margins often come from services that combine high-ticket items with recurring revenue, such as laser treatments, injectables, and high-end facials.
* **Retail Products:** Offering skincare products can enhance revenue with good margins, especially if the products are tied to the services offered.
* **Membership Programs:** Monthly membership models can provide a stable revenue base and improve client retention.
* **Operational Efficiency:** Utilize technology for appointment booking, client records, and marketing to reduce staffing needs and minimize errors.
* **Marketing:** Invest in both digital and community-based marketing. A robust online presence, coupled with local networking, can drive new and repeat business.
* **Expense Management:** Regularly review expenses such as supplies, utilities, and staffing to ensure they align with current revenue streams.

Keep in mind, a medspa's profitability is as much an art as it is a science. So keep innovating, keep your services as fresh as your clients’ post-peel faces, and remember: the secret to making more dough is providing so much value that your clients wouldn't dream of going anywhere else. Here’s to keeping it light, tight, and, above all, profitable!",2024-04-10 17:00:11+00:00,38,25
1c0q0l2,MedSpa,101 - How to start a medspa (as of Q2 2024),"Starting a medical aesthetic practice in the U.S., such as dermatology, medspa, or plastic surgery, requires a multi-faceted approach. Here is a 101 guide on how to embark on this venture:

**Legal Launch:**

1. **Professional Licensing:** Ensure all medical professionals involved have the appropriate state licenses to practice. This is usually the first step before setting up any kind of medical practice.
2. **Regulatory Compliance:** You'll need to comply with HIPAA for patient privacy and OSHA for workplace safety. For medspas, compliance with state-specific regulations governing aesthetic procedures is crucial.
3. **Business Structure:** Decide on your business entity type, such as an S-corp or LLC, and register your business with the state. Consider hiring a lawyer to assist with this process.
4. **Insurance:** Obtain malpractice insurance and general business insurance to protect against liability.
5. **Accreditation and Certification:** Some procedures may require accreditation from a recognized body. Ensure that all medical staff are certified to perform the services offered.

**Go-To-Market Strategy:**

1. **Market Research:** Identify your target demographic and understand the local demand for aesthetic services. Look at competition and price your services competitively.
2. **Service Menu:** Define what services you'll offer. It's better to start with a small number of popular services and expand as you grow.
3. **Location:** Choose a location that's accessible to your target market and complies with local zoning laws for medical practices.

**Branding:**

1. **Brand Identity:** Develop a strong brand identity that resonates with your target audience, including a business name, logo, and theme that will be carried across all marketing materials.
2. **Online Presence:** Build a professional website and maintain active social media profiles to establish an online presence.

**Patient Acquisition:**

1. **Marketing:** Invest in both online and offline marketing strategies. Online strategies may include SEO, content marketing, and paid advertisements. Offline strategies might include community events or partnerships with local businesses.
2. **Referral Programs:** Encourage word-of-mouth referrals by offering incentives to patients who refer new clients.
3. **Networking:** Network with other healthcare providers to receive referrals. This is particularly useful in the medical field.

**Patient Loyalty:**

1. **Quality of Care:** Provide excellent patient care and customer service to encourage repeat visits.
2. **Follow-Up:** Implement a system for following up with patients after procedures to ensure satisfaction and to encourage them to return.
3. **Loyalty Programs:** Create a loyalty program or membership model to foster patient retention.
4. **Feedback:** Actively seek patient feedback and use it to improve your services.

Remember, the success of your medical aesthetic practice will be heavily dependent on the quality and consistency of your services, as well as how effectively you navigate the legal and business aspects of the healthcare industry. Regularly review and adapt your strategies to stay current with industry trends and regulatory changes.",2024-04-10 16:38:39+00:00,48,0

1agm060,MedSpa,Ideas for Med Spa Commercial,"Hello there!

I just joined this subreddit and was wondering if I could ask y'all for some ideas. I'm a filmmaker and I recently got the opportunity to create a commercial for a local med spa. I'm very excited about the opportunity because directing commercials is something I love doing. This time around I have zero experience with the topic. I haven't been to a med spa before. So I wanted to gather some information before writing a script from people who appreciate what med spas do. 

From my research thus far I found that approximately 85% of customers are women aged 35-55. I also know that this particular med spa is very proud of having the Scarlet RF, which the owner of the med spa told me, is the first one in Central Florida. 

Now my question to you is: what kind of message should the commercial convey for you to pay attention and be like, ""I want to go to this particular med spa."" Is it the technology? Is it the customer service? Is it that it's bilingual (spanish)? Is it the subscription packages that are available? Is it the other services (IV, facials, botox, lipo)? Or is it seeing a couple of beautiful women visiting the med spa together as a social activity like getting your nails done with your bestie?

I would greatly appreciate any thoughts or ideas because I want to get it right and not misrepresent what med spas stand for.

Thanks!

I am Philip and i would like to tell you the history and insights of Spa and Massage as a whole. Lets Go.

The history of spa massage dates back to ancient times. The Finnish saunas, thought to have originated around 7,000 B.C., are possibly the oldest example of spa treatments. Ancient Egyptians were the first to have practiced early forms of spa treatment. The Greeks and Romans spread the concept throughout their empires, establishing public baths in their colonies. The benefits of spas were also known to the Japanese, who established public bathhouses and saunas.

The word “Spa” comes from the Belgian town of Spa, where a health resort was established in the 14th century. By the 16th century, the spa’s popularity began to rise and after 200 years the medicinal uses of spring water were rediscovered.The 19th century saw spa routines include soaking in hot water, drinking the water, steaming in a vapor room, and relaxing in a cooling room etc. Massage was added to the mix, and it is from here that the modern treatments we know today were derived.

**The Rise of Resort Spa**

&#x200B;

[Spa Resort](https://preview.redd.it/zekwff3nue7c1.jpg?width=2400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4c5a62867c8cfc6b02c2a288109894b80c01e6b6)

The springs at the village of Spa would become popular in the 18th century. And this popularity correlates with the opening of innumerable other spas in the world.

As hot springs and mineral baths had already been popular in Europe for centuries, colonists arriving in North America quickly began seeking them out to use for medicinal and therapeutic use.

A new idea called Thlassotherapy arrived.The idea was that by bathing in the sea, trace amounts of sodium, calcium magnesium, iodide, and potassium are absorbed through the skin. Therapy could also include the use of seaweed, algae and these elements cleans your skin and body from dead cells and gives you a healthy body. Even the seaside climate itself was thought to promote health, beauty, and wellness.

**Spa becomes Mainstream**

The new seaside resorts were just a part of the growing spa industry. Meanwhile, in America, hot springs and mineral baths began to be seen as antiquated.Americans were moving to urban areas and they started to seek health and relaxation centers closer to where they lived and worked.

This is largely where the modern spa industry comes from.This not only made spas more convenient but accessible to more people. Hence the modern spa day.

Spas would also start offering broader ranges of services outside of their traditional roles. Many modern spas offer everything from traditional skin treatments to body sculpting.

**What is Massage Theraphy**

Spa treatments are non-medical procedures given by licensed professionals. They are primarily aimed at improving your health, helping you relax, and addressing any physical discomfort.

Spa treatments take place at spa resorts, day spas, destination spas, and beauty salons.The following factors help you to choose the right spa.

1. **Check Spa’s Review**: You can learn so much about a business by the reviews they do (or don’t) have.Check Google or other places for the Spa’s review so that you may know what other people have to say about the spa.

2. **Check the Service options**: There are many massage therapies available.Most spas will have an online menu of services offered and you can choose from among the many options available after calling them and deciding about the prices offered.

3. **Therapist experience**:Even though this is a very important factor you cant exactly find out the real experience of the therapist we can find out a little by looking the the spa’s website.

4. **Spa Environment**: The aesthetic of a spa can absolutely make or break your experience.Drop into a spa and have a look at their interiors before deciding to take the plunge.

5. **Products used**: Quality absolutely matters, especially if you have sensitive skin or allergic.In addition to pricing and service menus, have a look at the products a spa uses.Finding a place that uses vegan, organic, or cruelty-free products is definitely a good place to start

18jy5jv,MedSpa,Claim for Small claims?,"After entering into a contract with a med spa I have and continue to experience unprofessional exchanges from them. They’ve made it clear that they just want money from me and don’t care about my wellbeing. They are a private practice and have a “no refund under any circumstances” policy. I have yet to receive any treatments under contract from them and I want to just cancel the contract and stop payments. I already put $100 down that I’m not asking for back. The owner has since emailed me to say that she heard I caused a scene making her employees and other clients feel unsafe and that there is a “code of conduct for clients” to which that would behavior would not be tolerated and they have the right to refuse service and no refunds would be issued afterwards. In the same email, she offered me 3 additional treatments for free to still come in and get my treatments done 🤡 I’m at a loss for how to move on from this. Obviously I don’t want to get my face/ body worked on from employees who supposedly were made to feel “unsafe” by me. Also, they can just fabricate something else to refuse service. The total is $2000 for the contract. Payments will still continue even if I don’t go in.

1755mmn,MedSpa,Okay to apply heat after IPL photofacial?,"I've had lots of med-spa skin treatments over the years, including IPL. I got my first IPL Photofacial today from my current med spa which I've had fairly good results and service so far.

For most of my treatments, it's been common aftercare to not overheat the skin for 48 hours -- no hot showers, strenuous exercise, etc. The aesthetician who worked on me today not only thought I was crazy when I asked about whether I needed to wait for exercise, but she actually gave me a facial after the IPL, including steam, extractions, and hot towels.

It wasn't painful (perhaps because I was numbed), and parts were quite relaxing, but this definitely seemed unusual. Has anyone else received a similar treatment? Is ""no heat for 48 hours"" outdated wisdom or falsely propogated? Researching why is a mixed bag between it will make you uncomfortable and it will negatively impact results.",2023-10-11 04:32:23+00:00,1,2

117kf1v,MedSpa,Medical Directorship in Illinois,"Hi all -- looking for some clarification on a few things.

I am an MD in Illinois who has been doing my own injections (toxin, filler mostly) for over two years now. I have become good in consistency and reproduction of desired results by my clients.

I have been approached by a ""Med Spa"" owner to become their Medical Director. From our preliminary talks, what they would like to achieve, is to be able to use my medical license to obtain injectables and other medical-grade products and use my existing skills to perform and also teach aesthetic nurses to perform injections. The owners are new to all of this as well as I am.

I have put together a list of things to ask as our discussion goes forward, including malpractice insurance handling, exact duties and responsibilities, expectations for services rendered, time commitments, etc. However, the biggest obstacle that I see at this time is that a Medical Director in Illinois needs to be a majority owner of the medical spa itself. Is this still correct? Where can I get more information on this online? Is there a good resource for someone like me to look at? Thank you",2023-02-20 21:02:00+00:00,4,7

zsjgwv,MedSpa,"Which is the Best HIFU Machine, 4D, 7D, or 9D?","There are so many different kinds of HIFU machines in the market. Are you searching what is the best HIFU machine? Are you feeling dazzled by the different HIFU machines on the market? Want to buy a HIFU machine but don't know which one to choose? Today, all these questions will be answered in this article.

**What is the 4D HIFU Machine?**

4D HIFU is the newer generation of Ultrasound. The extraordinary effects of high-energy ultrasound waves (HIFU) for skin tightening and skin rejuvenation have been proven. New advanced high-energy ultrasound techniques have been used to design 4D HIFU devices.

&#x200B;

The four-dimensional HIFU device transmits deep ultrasound energy deep into the skin to do that. 4D HIFU waves pass through the epidermal layer and do not cause any damage to the upper layer of the skin, and depending on the cartridge used, they can penetrate to the desired depth.

4D HIFU exerts a thermal effect on skin collagen fibers, stimulating the superficial muscular aponeurotic system and literally breaking down fatty tissue. The skin is lifted and tightened. Preliminary results of 4D HIFU are visible at once after it is done, which will satisfy the clients very much. But the main results will be visible 4-5 months after HIFU therapy is done.

**What is the 7D HIFU Machine?**

Ultrasound energy is concentrated in the 7D HIFU device and is then targeted at a small focal point in the skin. New advanced micro&macro focused ultrasound techniques have been used to design 7D HIFU machines. This increases collagen and elastin production and the degradation of fats.

collagen and elastin are the main factors in the youthfulness of the skin. These waves do not cause any damage to the skin or the surrounding tissue but rejuvenate the tissue in question. As a result, 7D HIFU devices can target deep layers of skin to tighten and rejuvenate the face without needles or surgery.

**What is 9D HIFU Machine?**

9D HIFU machine with 12 press line ultrasonic body slimming & face lifting, more than **21,000 shots** according to quality inspection and clinical tests, ensuring that each shot effects into the right depth set by default. And max 12 lines of shots in one time save your treatment time. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) uses precise medical-grade ultrasound energy for non-surgical face lifting and skin tightening. The 9D HIFU is a ninth-generation HIFU machine offering higher power, lesser discomfort, increased safety, and clinically proven results. New advanced MMFU techniques, High-intensity focused ultrasound techniques, Liposonix techniques, and Hi360 techniques have been used to design 9D HIFU machines.

It literally achieves the results of a facelift or a body lift without any invasive surgery or injections, moreover, an added bonus of this procedure is that there is no downtime. This technique can be applied to the face as well as the whole body, and also, it works equally well for people of all skin colors, in contrast to that lasers and intense pulse lights.

**SUMMARY**

The big difference between the HIFU machines is the technique, result, customer experience, and cartridge number. In general, if your budget is not enough, you can choose a 4D HIFU machine. If you have a certain budget and want to purchase a machine with better performance, then you'd better choose a 7D HIFU machine. If you don't need to consider the budget and want to give customers the best experience and attract repeat customers, 9D HIFU is undoubtedly the best choice. Since the 9D HIFU machine applies more technologies than the previous two machines, the larger handle will save time for customers, make customers feel almost no discomfort, and the effect will last longer.",2022-12-22 11:01:52+00:00,3,3
zn9n8j,MedSpa,HYDRAFACIAL TREATMENT MACHINE: THE SECRET TO BOOM YOUR BUSINESS,"Nowadays, Oxygen facials are becoming more and more popular because they are effective, especially in regards to making the skin look younger, cleaning pores, and reducing wrinkles, so as a spa owner, offering HydraFacial treatment is very necessary - it's definitely one of the most popular options for pampering and general self-care. With the HydraFacial machine, you can make getting facials more comfortable and convenient for your client. 

Here is some information maybe you need to know before you invest in this machine.

**What is HydraFacial?**

A HydraFacial is an innovative, medical-grade facial treatment that uses a three-stage process to help you unlock radiant, younger-looking skin. By combining cleansing, extraction, and serum infusions in one single procedure, clients can walk away with a complexion that’s so clean and clear, they won’t need a drop of makeup or concealer.

Because HydraFacial is a medical-grade treatment, that means it’s considered to be more effective than a typical spa facial. Additionally, it needs to be administered by a licensed esthetician, dermatologist, or plastic surgeon.

HydraFacial is a gentle yet effective alternative to harsher facial treatments 

Here are some of the reasons people love this spa treatment:

**The Benefit of HydraFacial**

**Works on all skin types.** 

Whether you have sensitive skin or acne, dry or oily skin, HydraFacial will work for you.

**Consistent outcomes.** Since much of the treatment is controlled by HydraFacial technology, you can achieve a consistently high-quality treatment every time.

**No downtime.** Another reason people love HydraFacial is that there is no downtime. You can even apply makeup that same day if you’d like to—though most people enjoy the glow from the treatment too much to cover it up.

**Immediate results.** Because the treatment is non-invasive, you can see positive results right away. We even recommend it before weddings or events for a luminous, healthy glow.

**Who Should Get the Hydrafacial?**

Since the HydraFacial is so customizable, it’s a good option for anyone looking for a little pick-me-up. It works across all skin tones and types—from those that are super dry to oily and acne-prone. This treatment is nice for teenagers with acne, adults with pimples, wrinkles, and hyperpigmentation, and older patients with sun damage and even flaky pre-cancerous spots (as part of more serious treatments). Although beneficial to many skin types, those with active rashes, sunburns, or rosacea, along with pregnant patients, should abstain from this treatment.

Anyway, investing in a Hydrafacial machine for your business is a simple way to increase your service offerings, attract new clients, and make your business more valuable. Newangie group has Best Professional Hydrafacial Machine that can help boom your beauty salon business and provide you with free online training for the machine. Contact us today, and let Newangie group become a loyal partner to help you open the door to the growing business.",2022-12-16 08:13:45+00:00,2,1

xd5y52,MedSpa,"MedSpa tech tries to talk me out of Ultherapy, offers RF MicroNeedling instead","I’ve been trying to have Ultherapy since 2020. 
I had a consultation in February 2020, but because of Covid, I wasn’t able to make an appointment right away. 

I moved to Texas, and booked a consultation with a different med spa, for Ultherapy. 

The tech starts telling me how I should have RF Needling, instead. That I would have more immediate results and that it was cheaper. 

I told her I have already tried RF Microneedling, and that although I did enjoy results fairly quickly, it was surface results. I was looking for something that would build collagen at a deeper level. 

She then put an ultrasound tool on my cheek skin to show me how deep my collagen was. 
The Ultherapy tool can go as deep as 7mm. 

She showed me that the bulk of my collagen was a 3 mm. 

She told me “Collagen only grows where collagen already exists.”

So, I agree to have her do two passes, one at 1.5 mm and one at 3mm. 

She starts the procedure, and it basically feels like RF MicroNeedling. 

I have also had Thermage…which is a little more expensive than Ultherapy…and the Thermage treatment went deeper, and actually did tighten up the loose skin under my chin. 

I also noticed that in the ultrasound, that there was collagen present at a deeper layer than 3 mm, there was just less of it. 

If she went deeper, would I be experiencing different results?

I’ve also had Liposuction under my chin, and CoolSculpting. 

I’m on their examination chair, pointing at a pocket of fat I want dissolved, and the Nurse Practitioner just assumed I had had all these Kybella injections. 

I told them my history when I first came in, about how I had Liposuction, then Thermage to tighten loose skin…then had to re-tell the history again. 

They’re coming up to me wanting to use before and after photos for their advertisement for Kybella. 

They’re offering me discounts and free treatments if I allow my pictures to be used. 

It rubbed me the wrong way, because my result wasn’t from Kybella, alone. 

I felt like that’s misleading…because I’m only using it as fine tuning. Kybella did not do any of the heavy lifting that Thermage did, or the liposuction did. 

They want me to come back in six weeks…AFTER I’m having a round of Ultherapy to take “after photos.”

My main issue is that they didn’t keep patient notes, and that’s just bad practice.

I know how to write out the papers for insurance and I have other ideas that have already been successful here for business and patient growth. I am a hardworking who came from nothing and worked my way to where I am and have many connections and have worked on celebrities, mvp sports players and Saudi Arabian royalty, and UN employees who have traveled the world and they all say that I am the best at what I do and ask me for advice and opinions, so I can back up that I am good at what I do, I see there isn't really any insurance based med spas in SC so clearly not alot of competition, and low overhead for high profits, and alot of room for growth and success. So basically what I am looking for is someone in SC who is interested in being partners and growing or basically just doing nothing but being there and making 100,000 plus year, I don't wanna work for a spa and I want to actually make money and have a decent life, I even have a friend who is an esthetician certified in laser hair and tattoo removal if wanted to add pay services.
