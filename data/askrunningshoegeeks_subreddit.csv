1kq61vd,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Race Day Shoe Recommendation Please!,"Short time runner, even shorter time racer.

After picking up running a few years ago, I finally did a HM this year and love-hated it so much I’m doing it again.

My current shoes are Novablast 5 (which I use for easy runs) and Superblast 2 (which I used for my last HM, and I use for longer runs, tempo and interval work).

Love them both am hoping to crack 1:50 in my next HM (first one was 1:54) and am convinced a race day shoe will help.

I was kind of looking at the Metaspeed Edge Paris and went into store to try them on. Didn’t expect them to be as wobbly as they were, especially since I enjoy the NB and SB very much - they feel so stable when I run.

The guy I spoke to at the shop said if I’m looking for something more stable, the AlphaFly 3 is probably a better bet.

Hoping for feedback and experiences.

If it helps at all, I’m 169cm, about 70kg. Last time I got my gait analysed was told I had a fair amount of heel strike (but that was about a year ago and a bit can change in year I think).

Also, I plan to get this like a week before race day - is that advisable. It might do one set of short intervals with me leading up to the race but I wanted a ‘surprise’ when I run in them on race day.

1kq4502,AskRunningShoeGeeks,New runner looking for some shoe recommendations please🙏,"Hey guys! Feeling a bit overwhelmed by the sea of information out there. I’m looking for the best running shoes I can get under $150 AUD based on my description: 

- Size 10ish US 
- Kind of wide feet

- 75-80kg
- I recently started running 5kms which is a distance I like, at a pace around 4:30 per km

However, I've heard complaints about the foam giving out around 300-400 miles. On the other hand, there's the propel v5, with better stability and the tpu plate. Unfortunately, it now costs MORE than the rebel v4 due to no sale being currently present.

1kq0kr5,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Wide Feet Problems/Recommendations,"Hey All,

I have tried many shoes, even those that come in wide and even extra wide but no matter what, my feet always feel crushed, specifically in the toe region. My pinky toe never feels like it has enough space and my mid foot bulges out the sides.

My most recent attempt was reviewing the wiki here and seeing Hoka Bondi 9 as a recommendation for wide feet. I got these in Extra Wide in fact and a half size up and still had the same issue. Previous to this I had tried the Nike InfinityRN 4 in Extra Wide which also hurt my feet quite a bit along with the above issues. I have tried a lot of others in the past as well, although none that come to mind in this moment.

What are some shoes you would advise for my feet? I know the reasonable answer is to go to a store and try some, which I plan to do but have not had the chance as of yet.

I did do a foot scan at Roadrunner a few years back, which stated my left foot was a 2E, while the right was extremely close to 4E. However, this doesn't seem entirely accurate since even when going extra wide it isn't enough (?). I could possibly just be choosing bad shoes.

The ones I am currently looking into are the Brooks Ghost 16 and the Saucony Ride 18. Does anyone have experience with abnormally wide feet and what shoes would work best for me?

Thank you!",2025-05-19 02:08:15+00:00,2,5
1kpvy39,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Shoe like the endorphin speed 4 but wider toebox,"Any recs on good tempo and race day (let's say 3:45 marathon) shoes for runner with wider feet? Loved the endorphin speed 4s - light, non-rockered, responsive - but had to return them as I started blistering in them. Hoping for the $100-$200 range - the wiki more discusses supershoes for Q26.

Stability is a plus but not a necessity, my trainers are stable and I don't need my faster shoes to be. My main criterion are toebox width, responsiveness, and the toebox not feeling overly rockered. Before the endorphin speed 4s, I raced in nike pegasus which were fine but I feel like I could get something faster (specifically, the nature next model which has next to no rocker in the toebox). The endorphin speed 4s do have a bit of curve in the toebox, but I find it to be more straight, rather than directing my weight diagonally into my big toe.

Some other options I've tried and haven't loved:

* brooks launch gts 10 - toebox too narrow
* ON shoes - midsole too hard
* alta shoes - may try zero drop in the future but not for this current race
* hoka mach 6 - toebox too narrow, front rocker too aggressive
* asic novablast - great except front rocker too aggressive

Some I have on my list to try on:

* various mizuno shoes
* New Balance FuelCell Rebel v4
* Have heard good things about the evo sl, but runrepeat has it with a narrow toebox
* Adidas Boston 12

1kpua2h,AskRunningShoeGeeks,I am lost and need some recommendations to build my rotation,"Hi everyone!
As the title suggests, I (26M, 5’11”/181cm, 176lbs/80kg) try to build a lineup of shoes (two pairs, I guess) but I cannot decide which ones will I get myself. I spent a lot of time watching videos or reading reviews about tons of different shoes but I feel like these are meant to be watched and read by experienced runners.
Anyway, my goal is to finish my first marathon in October in less than 4h and I currently run with a quite old pair of Adidas Supernova+. I like these shoes but I would love to have more cushioning and confort in here since I find these perfectly stable and wide enough for me. I am pretty sure I can find something better for my long runs. I wouldn’t say no to something more performance-oriented but my biggest concerns are definitely stability and confort. After some research, I think I need something with a wide outsole, I think this is what I mean when I say stabilty.

1kptlx0,AskRunningShoeGeeks,“Long” Runs,"So, I will be running my first marathon on 10/5/25. Currently, my daily trainers are the Hoka Mach 6’s and Adidas Adizero Evo SL’s which I like. I previously used the Hoka Clifton’s as my daily trainers, but I much prefer the lighter/bouncier feel of the Mach and Evo’s. My “recovery” shoes are the Hoka Skyflow which have some nice cushioning. However, I was wondering what would be an ideal choice for my “long” training runs? I used the Evo’s for a 10 mile run and I feel like that’s about as far as I would want to train in them, so I was wondering if you guys recommend a shoe with a plate for longer runs to get “energy return”? I plan to run the marathon in the Adidas Adios Pro 4’s so I will incorporate those closer to race day. For now, I am thinking about adding the Hoka Mach X2’s into my rotation as my long run shoes. Do any of you have any experience with this shoe or have other recommendations? ",2025-05-18 20:28:26+00:00,1,6
1kpt6wf,AskRunningShoeGeeks,"Low stack, wide midfoot trail shoe suggestions?","Can anyone help me find a wide, low stack trail shoe (but not a ""barefoot"" shoe)?

I've followed the FAQ, hopefully got this right...

>Budget

I'm prepared to spend big (supershoe prices) if I can find something that works for me.

>Intended use and distance (speed workouts, walking, long runs, easy runs, races, versatile)

50km and up midpack races

>Foot size/shape (narrow, normal or wide feet)

I have very wide feet, particularly in the midfoot.

I also like a wide toe box or my toes rub and blister

>Foot strike (heel/midfoot/forefoot or pronation requirements)

Forefoot strike I prefer low or zero drop. I am not looking for stability features

>Shoe weight preference (Light & nimble or heavier bigger stack?)

Light and nimble

I train in minimalist footwear, so I would prefer wide toe box, low stack, soft uppers, etc.

I need more protection for ultra distance on trails than ""barefoot"" brands offer. Nothing against them, but I believe in using the right tool for the job.

>Prefered feel (Firm ride or soft ride?)

Firm ride

>Surfaces (road, track, trail, treadmill)

Trail

>Any prior shoes you may have liked or disliked

**Brooks Ghost extra wide (road shoe)** The heel drop gave me issues. The narrow toe box made my toes rub and blister

**Altra Lone Peak 5, 6, 7** I use these for walking around but they are too narrow in the midfoot for running for me. I have tried sizing up but it puts the arch support in the wrong place and it feels like I will trip over them. I also find the foam feels too soft / lacks bounce.

**HOKA wide (can't remember the model)** The rockers and lack of groundfeel didn't work me

**Vivobarefoot** Good width, great toe box. I like these for intervals and strength work. Too minimalist for ultradistance

**Vibram Fivefingers** In desperation I even tried the weird toe shoes. They are quite wide but they don't fit my toes very well. The stack is too low for ultradistance. They look goofy

**Trail sandals** Running huaraches have no midfoot width restriction, so I've had some success with these. However, I'm worried about hitting rocks etc. Particularly towards the end of ultras where running form degrades and things get sloppy!

>Any shoes you are considering

**Norda 002** This has the specs I am looking for, but is it wide enough?

**New Balance Minimus TR 2025** Perhaps too low stack and people say it runs narrow?

What else should be on my radar?

Which shoe would you suggest to pair with the Magic speed 4 ? Or is it maybe the better option to stay with the Magmax and the Superbalst instead of the magic speed 4 ?
I have not used the ms4 outside, so I can send them back to if necessary.
Where are they overlapping and differ ?

I’ve always tried running in the past but it’s uncomfortable when you’re bigger chested and I ALWAYS get shin splints, no matter how much I stretch or prep.

Anyways, I was at Marshall’s and found Adidas Ultradream bold runners and bought them through my works PSA for only $60 and they are BY FAR the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever owned/tried running in and I noticed a huge difference with the shin splints. My question is, has anyone worn those and have a comparable shoe? I love those but they are hard to find here in Canada and I’m not a big online shopper! I am looking at hokas but I know nothing about them and which style is best! TIA!",2025-05-18 04:05:58+00:00,1,3

Though the Kayanos are roomier and the NBs have more of a snug fit. The toe box is ever so slightly tighter on the NBs but I imagine once I break them in, it’ll be fine.

I’m stuck in deciding which one to stick with. The NBs appeal to me more as I feel more nimble and speedy with them and I think that might be better given I’ll be doing somewhat shorter runs, especially on the treadmill.

My Evo SLs have over 300m on them and still feel fine but I am just starting to have a look around (mainly because I love shoes).

1koi1rf,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Looking for neutral running shoe without noticeable toe spring,"Do most running shoes these days (that aren’t zero drop/barefoot) have high toe spring? I just tried the NB 880 v14 and the Saucony Kinvara 14, and both of these had intolerable toe spring so that I felt like I was going to lose my balance while standing and fall forward.

I don’t want to feel like I’m standing on a cliff with my toes hanging over when wearing shoes, so this is a deal breaker for me. However, based on reading and looking at pictures and videos, it looks to me like most running shoes these days have toe spring, and that this has been increasing in recent years. So I need to find shoes that have very little toe spring like older shoes.

I’ve been wearing Nike Pegasus for many years, and I’m currently on 40, which has a little bit of an up curve by itself, but while I’m wearing it, I feel like my entire sole is securely resting on the ground. My understanding is that the 41 revision has more toe spring and rocker. The last non-Pegasus shoes I’ve had are so old, they’re out of production (e.g., Brooks Dyad, ASICS Fortitude). But I want to branch out so I have more options and don’t put all my eggs in one basket.

The toe spring is the main criterion, but here are my other requirements:

 * Neutral
 * Medium cushion and stack height
 * Medium drop (not zero drop)
 * Wide forefoot (ideally combined with normal heel, but I’ve never found a shoe like this for my typical East Asian foot shape)
 * No aggressive arch support
 * Flexible sole so my toes and forefoot can bend without toe spring
 * Good for walking and heel strike - I’ll be using these shoes for walking because I had to quit running due to injuries and now do brisk walking instead",2025-05-17 02:08:42+00:00,2,24

1kngbq6,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Help me pick my “sole mate” — running shoe showdown! (Photos inside 👀),"I’ve been ramping up my runs lately—5 to 6 times a week, usually 5K to 10K distances. I’m not into sprinting or chasing podiums—just trying to improve my stamina, fix my form, and maybe look slightly less like a collapsing marionette by the end of my runs. 😅

My go-to terrain is mostly packed ground and some roads ( which terrain is ideally suggested). No specific foot concerns (yet), but I’d like to keep it that way as my mileage climbs. Budget’s around ₹5K, so I’ve been scouting some good deals here in India.

👉 I’ve attached photos of all the shoes I’ve shortlisted in the order I’m considering them. I’m especially hooked on the Tarther RP 3 - cause of the steal idea I am getting on those pairs—but I’m wide open to opinions, which one would you suggest from the models shared above or any other pair under same budget. 

What I need from you, awesome people:
What’s your favorite shoe for regular road running?
Anything that helped you improve form or stamina?
Any of the shoes in my list you’ve loved—or regretted?
If you had ₹5K and were in my feet (literally), what would you choose?
I’m aiming to push past my current PR of 8K, and the right shoes might just be the game-changer. Appreciate any input, personal stories, or strong shoe opinions you’re willing to share.

Thanks a ton—and happy running! 👟🔥

1knfy7z,AskRunningShoeGeeks,"Running Shoe Recommendations - Hoka Clifton, Glycerin Max or ASICS Nimbus","Hi folks,
I am in the market for a new running shoes for the military. Ultimately they'll be for my PT test @ 2 miles but I'll use them when training for that so I'll probably be running 2-4 miles at most at a time.

I'm 5'11 225 and l've had 2 knee surgeries so that's something to keep in mind. I don't get too much pain or anything but I just something to keep in mind.

With that out of the way I went to Fleet Feet today and they measured out my feet and said because I have higher arches and need some more cushion due to the knee injury they recommended the Brooks Glycerin Max, the Hoka Clifton and then I personally liked the ASICS Nimbus. I also tried the ASICS Novablast and the Topos Atmos. All together I liked the Hoka Cliftons and the Brooks Glycerin Max but I'm not used to the height of the shoe itself, maybe l'd adjust to it over time time?
And I liked the ASICS Nimbus over the Novablast.

I also liked the Topos Atmos. With that said I'm looking for any other recommendations for a good beginner running shoe. Anyone have any in mind?

I've been running in the Novablast 5s and they've been great up until recently. Over the past few months, I’ve been training for a 10K and logging about 100–120 km per month.

Unfortunately, I’ve developed ingrown toenails on both big toes. I reached out to a podiatrist and she asked for pictures of my running shoes. As soon as she saw them, she said they looked too narrow and blamed them for the issue.

The thing is, they don’t *feel* narrow at all—I’ve really enjoyed running in them. I’d hate to have to switch brands if I don’t need to.

What do you all think? Could the shoes still be the cause even if they feel fine?

1kn1y48,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Need advice: can I buy the same shoe at a different store then use that for a return?,"So a local running store (part of a chain; I live in Canada) that usually doesn’t allow used returns recently posted on their socials that they were doing a promo for Spring. It said for a limited time we were allowed to buy the shoes, try them out for a few months, and return them if we don’t like them.

I ordered a race pair I was curious about to try for a few runs. I got it for pick-up but when I confirmed at the store, they said the promo instructions were valid but that they might not be able to accept shoes if they look too used/worn. I understand since it’s a chain so the HQ management might set up a promo but it’s up to the local stores to enforce and it’s a reasonable ask. They said I should ideally only try it on a treadmill but I argued that since they’re race shoes, it wouldn’t be much of a test. They agreed I could try them on gentle paved roads.

My issue is I planned my route for gentle paved roads and only tried them for 2 short-ish runs but you can already see some wear on the bottom and a bit of dirt on the collar of the upper. It’s still in just like new condition, just noticeable use. I’m worried they might not accept a return because of this. I did understand the risk and I’m prepared to bear the cost but it is pretty expensive and will stretch my budget. I also don’t  think it’s a good fit for me.

I recently noticed the exact same shoe had a substantial sale at another store. I then had the thought that I could buy it on sale and return that brand new one so I can save some money. My question is, especially to people who’ve worked in running stores and/or in warehouses dealing with shoe sales & tracking, can I just buy the exact same shoe (same model, colorway, size) and just use that for the return? I’d be using the exact same packaging and everything that comes with it, just a different shoe. Is there a way they can know and track this and is it allowed and/or legal? (I know if it was allowed it would technically abide by the spirit of the return policy since I’m giving them a shoe they can still sell, but wouldn’t want to get in trouble)

I am no longer seeing the value in having so many different options for daily trainers. For example, right now, my rotation is the Hurricane 24, Gel-Nimbus 26 (just to change it up), and Brooks Hyperion Max for those days I want to run faster.

I just sold off my Novablast 5 pair, even though they may have been the best shoe I have ever owned. They just didn't really serve a purpose. My Hurricanes are more protective than NB5 and tbh I could hit similar paces perhaps even easier. Maybe they are not as fun as the Novablasts, but really, the NB5 just were not useful for me. If I want to run faster like in a tempo run, I will use my Hyperion Max 2's or Endorphin Trainers. This begs the question, why have these shoes on the market? I understand variety, cost, weight, stack, etc. IMO, you can get a higher stack, more protective and just as fast in some respects for a little extra cost.

Shoes I am thinking about that are no longer as relevant as they used to be are the Brooks Glycerin 21/22, Saucony Ride 17/18, Brooks Ghost 17, etc. type shoe. There is value in a racing shoe and tempo shoe. I still think for me a tempo shoe fills in the racing void (they are more comfortable and while not as fast, can still be pretty fast for my personal abilities.)

So for me the necessary shoes are:

\-Max Stack but good rocker type shoes ala Saucony Hurricane 24...I can still hit some tempo paces with these.

\-Tempo-specific shoe ala Brooks Hyperion Max 2/Saucony Speed 4, Endorphin Trainer

\-Any other shoe to just give your feet something different to feel underneath but completely unnecessary. I think this is why the Superblast was such a popular shoe as it combines daily, max stack, tempo and weight into a perfect package: a package that I've never tried lol.

I wasn't able to execute a full training program due to injury restrictions early on but I love going to this event (Cleveland). I've averaged 28 miles the last 12 weeks and 32 the last 6 so I'm not totally undertrained although I don't have a really long run done.    I'll be going at 5 hour pace so I think it's dumb to wear racing shoes.  The Gel Nimbus 26 are super comfy and well broken in but I've never taken them over 13.1 and I worry about them being too heavy.

I’m currently running around **150km/week**, mostly road, and training toward a **2:50 marathon** (recently ran one in that range). I’m a **light runner** and generally prefer shoes that are responsive but still comfortable over longer efforts.

# Current rotation:

* **Adidas Adizero EVO SL** – absolutely love this one for daily runs and progression efforts.
* **ASICS Novablast 5** – my go-to for easy and long runs, but it’s now at **almost 800km**.
* **ASICS Magic Speed 3** – used for tempo/intervals, but also nearing the end of its life.

1kma9bd,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Endorphin Speed 4 legit?,"Got these on Vinted for €95 (originally listed at €120, total €105 with fees/shipping).

1km9inc,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Sizing question on Puma Deviate Nitro 3 Elites (shown: Saysky vs 'regular' Hyrox colorway),"TLDR: Should I stick with these size 11 Saysky x Puma DNE3s or half-size down based on these photos? Fourth slide has a 10.5 of a different variant on the right shoe.

Hey y'all! Normally I would defer this question to my run shops but having a bit of a conundrum and conflicting advice with these Deviate Nitro Elite 3s.

So ever since I got to try out the DNE3s at a Hyrox event I've been in love with the foam and the shoes from Deviate Nitro line as a whole. I run size 11s normally, but unfortunately 10.5 was the only size available. Honestly at the time I didn't mind because I figured a more snug shoe would help out with the various exercises in Hyrox (lunges, sled pushes/pulls and the like). Plus because they ran long, I still had ample toe room (as you can see on image 4, Hyrox colorway is on the right shoe). The only thing is, I could definitely feel it being a bit snug in the midfoot/heel area, though I chalked that up to it being a race day shoe. But seriously, these fuckers are a bit narrow.

Saysky recently came out with a collab with Puma, and I fell in love with their colorways even though apparently the upper materials were changed, which is the reason I'm even specifying the brand - I wasn't sure if that meant the fit for these variants were changed too. I had heard the new uppers they used made them slightly heavier than regular.

In any case, I got their pink regular Deviate Nitro 3 colorway in size 11 for long run training which fit perfectly, so I went ahead and ordered the size 11 for the DNE3s thinking it'd be better suited for an upcoming marathon I'm training for in September.

At first blush the size 11 Saysky DNE3s fit amazingly, I have a good heel lockdown without feeling snug like I did on my 10.5 Hyrox versions...but I'm noticing an almost excessive amount of length at the big toe area, almost a full inch of space. Reading up more on this subreddit made me realize that Puma shoes tend to run long and narrow, though other review websites like RunRepeat have commented that the DNE3s run true to size (a video by Run Testers was the only review I found that even mentioned the length). 

Taking it for a walk and light jogs around the house (I've yet to test them on a treadmill), they don't feel clunky at all, no slippage that I can yet tell, though the length in the big toe area is definitely noticeable in a way that I'm not used to (though not exactly in a bad way, if that makes sense?)

I've gotten some conflicting advice from two run shops I reached out to. The first one suggested going down a half size to 'ensure the knuckle of my foot aligns with the shoe better' to keep myself efficient during the marathon, meanwhile some friends that work at a local shop actually suggested I keep it at 11 especially 'to accommodate the width of my feet' (I'm not *quite* 2E but I'm definitely right under), and that this size would be 'better suited for marathon distances to accommodate swelling' and to keep my 10.5 Hyrox variants for shorter races like 5/10ks.

All in all, what do you guys think? Should I stick it out with these size 11s or would it be safer to exchange them for size 10.5s, knowing I already have a second pair (admittedly a different variant) on hand? 

As for some background info on me, I'm a 5'7 200lb runner who's had a few full and half marathons as well as 1 Hyrox down. I've raced in AF3s and Metaspeeds in size 11, so I have some experience with carbon plated racers, though I haven't tried anything as long as these DNE3s just yet.

days.

Found a size chart online that said they should fit the same size I wear in Asics and went half a size up from that to a 12 just to be safe based on the online reviews about fit.

They've arrived today and trying them on seem to fit well other than my big toe and little toe on each foot seem very close to the edge of the upper, almost as if they're going to slip over the edge of the shoe when running. They don't feel uncomfortable though and there is still enough length in the shoe, about half a finger's width between end of foot and end of shoe.

Have also been at work for 12 hours today and played tennis this evening so feet may be a little more swollen than normal.

For those who have the shoes, is that the usual fit? Don't want to run in them if I need to get a different size but also feel like going a size up may leave too much room at the end of the shoe.

Looking to add a 4th shoe to my rotation - Also, I know I likely don't ""need"" another pair, but I've always been drawn to hobbies/activities that I can kind of nerd out on gear - other hobbies of mine are currently golf, photography, cycling, snowboarding, and I built a PC a couple years ago for gaming and photo/video editing.

Some Background:

38-year-old male, currently at 180 lbs and aiming to cut down to 170-175 before maintaining. I was around 215 lbs six months ago.

I've always been pretty active—gym, CrossFit, cycling, hiking, and played team sports growing up. Now, I want to focus primarily on running while still hitting the gym a couple days a week for strength work (likely just a Upper/Lower split focusing on compounds movements).

I've done a few half marathons in the past (without any training), with my PB just under 2 hours (1:59:40) quite a few years ago... but I couldn't walk properly for a few days after... lol

I did a 10K race last month with very little training and finished in (48:40) - Prior to the race I was doing some walk/run intervals from a ""return to running"" program my physio gave me because when I tried getting into running in the past, I would typically run into calf/achilles issues from running too much/too fast too quickly, so he had me starting at square 1, and fortunately I haven't had any issues so far (knock on wood). 

I've signed up for a half marathon this October and I'm hoping to come in at (1:40) or under. I'm also thinking about doing a full marathon sometime next year.

Training wise, I run about 4 days a week, following my Garmin daily workout/running plan suggestions with my October half entered as my ""event"" in the calendar.

My current shoe rotation:

* Nike Vomero 18 (Slow/Easy Runs)
* Nike Zoom Fly 6 (Faster/Tempo Runs & Speed Work)
* Adidas Adios Pro 3 (Race day/some Tempo Runs)

I'll likely be adding something like the Alphafly for my half in Oct with plans on using them for any other halfs/full marathons next year with the AP3's then being moved to shorter races (5-10KM) and maybe used more on tempo days as well.

I'm also in Canada, so access to the commonly referenced Superblast 2 & EVO SL are still pretty hard to get here at the moment.",2025-05-13 19:28:36+00:00,1,2
1klum9h,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Shoes for 80-140km ultras.,"It’s my intention to start running road ultras in the next 12 months and I m looking for shoes I need to start getting used to sooner or later. My current rotation is NB5 for easy runs, ES4 for intervals, SB2 for long and races, and AP4 for not knowing better (it was a mistake, will try to use it for intervals at some point so I get my moneys worth). But my training plan is for marathons right now. 

What should I be looking for? Comfort and cushion? Stability? Wide toe box like an altra or a Topo? Are easy run shoes like hoca bondi, nb 1080 or Mizuno neo zen no gos due to too much cushion and foam or viable options?  Haven’t checked yet but I could be able to switch shoes at a major CP in some races, it could be an option. In my mind, carbon or nylon plates is out of the question in my case and I’m ok with that. Any particular models I should be checking out? 

If it important to know, I’m on the heavy and a bit tall side, 6ft (1.87cm), 180lb (80kg) and hopefully not lighter by then. ",2025-05-13 19:13:30+00:00,8,12
1klui0h,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Advice on shoes to add to my rotation (first marathon training),"I recently started the hansons advanced marathon training program for a marathon in August. Currently around 45 mpw but will ramp over 60 at the peak of the plan. My rotation is Adidas Boston 12 for fast intervals and long runs, Adidas Evo SL for tempo and easy runs and Adidas SL2 for just easy runs.

The Boston’s are up around 300 miles but still feeling good (I’m anticipating probably having to replace those in this training block) and the SL2’s are around 400 miles and just starting to feel dead so I’m going to replace those imminently. I enjoyed the SL2’s as a daily trainer but as I’ve increased volume I think I’d like something a little more cushioned for the easy days.

I’m currently debating how I should approach replacing my SL2’s. On one hand I’m considering getting a super trainer like the Superblasts as they could replace the Evo Sl’s for tempo runs and additionally cover some of the volume the Boston 12’s are getting in long run and speed intervals. The Evo Sl’s would then slot into taking on the majority of the easy run work. The other option I’m considering is getting something exclusively for easy/long runs like the asics glideride max and keeping my other shoes as is. Any advice or help would be much appreciated.

For context on me, I’m male 29 years old, 5’6 165 pounds and a neutral runner and midfoot striker. I started running again in January 2024 after a decade off after high school cross country. My only race since high school was a half marathon in April 2024 I ran at 1:39:24,  my current goal for August is 3:45.

Current Training Paces Below 
Z2/Easy Runs:9:00-9:20min/mile 
Long Runs:8:30-9:00min/mile 
Tempo Runs:7:45-8:15min/mile 
Speed Intervals:6:30-7:00min/mile",2025-05-13 19:08:47+00:00,1,1

I'm at around 425 miles on those now and I'm going to be picking up a new pair of shoes to replace these soon enough. I also am racing a marathon in three weeks - shooting for sub 3:30. I've done all of my training for the marathon in these shoes, easy runs, speedwork, long runs with marathon pace miles. So a couple of questions:

* Is it worth me getting race specific shoes and then getting another pair of Novablasts as my trainers?
* Should I try to get a slightly snappier shoe to still be my one shoe I do everything in? If so, any suggestions?

More context - My long-term goal is to be working towards a sub-3 over the next year or two. Not racing with a carbon plated shoe right now is okay with me (I'll introduce those as I get closer to that ultimate time goal).

I recently ordered a pair of Nike Pegasus 41s (Nike By You version) from a guy on Vinted who claims he bought them at a Nike Outlet in Hungary. What’s bothering me is that the box says the shoes are Made in Switzerland, but the label inside the shoes says Made in China. That doesn’t add up to me. From what I've seen the NBY shoes are sent in a white box saying ""Made for ___"". I asked the guy about that and he says he doesn't know and that he bought them from Nike Outlet.

Has anyone seen a legit pair with this kind of mismatch? I thought Nike didn’t manufacture shoes in Switzerland at all. Everything else looks decent — quality, design, etc. — but that “Made in” conflict has me suspicious.

1kkxdl0,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Support-type shoe recommendations,"Been wearing adrenaline awhile now. Running shoe store put me in them back when I actually ran. A few years ago I got a bad case of plantar fasciitis and gave up running. My left foot still gives me troubles, nothing like when I want to a doctor for it, but I still don’t feel comfortable running.

My last, and very worn out shoes, are adrenaline 22. I recently took the brooks online shoe finder and it stated neutral, that ghosts may be good. I tried them, the 16s, but they killed me. Little walk here or there was fine. Any faster paced walk to exercise then my foot would be in pain for days after.

Should I just stick with adrenaline?

I wanted a little more cushion, but I also worry more cushion might not necessarily be a good thing?

Ghost and adrenaline back to back felt very similar but ghost was on sale so I went that route. I assume the lack of support was what killed my foot.

Also interested in on cloud cloudrunner. They say that’s their support shoe but I was afraid it may be too cushy and not enough support?

I’d go to a running shoe store, but in the past my experiences haven’t left me feeling like they really know what they’re doing. It’s sort of just like since I’ve been in adrenaline’s all along, may as well stay in them. That plus nothing is ever on sale locally, and I’m a little frugal.  I may need to and that’s fine, it’s just awkward if I go to get their advice and don’t buy anything.

1kkwkw7,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Daily/Mid-Long run training to compliment Superblast 2?,"Some recommendations would be greatly appreciated. I just recently purchased the superblast 2's and absolutely love them. Wish I could wear them for every run. But, I know I shouldn't. So, that is what brings me here.

When marathon training ramps up, I am going to be running 4-5 days a week. There will be a long run, a track day for speed sessions and then some easy/recovery runs and probably a mid week mid range easy run. I want to wear the superblast for everything but the track workout.

I would just get a 2nd pair of the superblast to rotate but I know it is also beneficial to rotate through different shoes (different stacks and drops).

Superblast 2:

weight: 249g

drop: 8 mm

Heel stack: 45 mm

Forefoot stack: 37 mm

With that said, what do you think that will compliment the superblast well for the same exact purpose as the superblast but to rotate in and out along with the superblast for those easy and mid runs? Something with the different stack and drop would probably be best, right?

My track workout shoes will probably be a rotation between Saucony Endorphin Pro 3, Addidas Pro 2, Saucony Endorphin speed 3, until I figure out which I prefer.

So essentially I have my speed session shoe (the 3 above) and my long run shoes (Superblast 2). I am missing that low and mid mileage easy and recovery run shoe that isn't the superblast 2. Maybe something that specializes in those short and mid easy runs or something that can do it all like the superblast, but still different enough from the superblast.

I’ve been running for a month or so and I’m currently following a HM plan. I’ve been running in an old pair of Saucony Ride 13s that are not comfortable and keep leaving me with sore feet, and would like a new pair of shoes.

I had a foot analysis at Decathlon yesterday which showed me as having a flat arch (took some photos myself too, I really do!) and the running shop yesterday mentioned that I overpronate slightly, which is something that has been mentioned to me before, and suggested a stability shoe for me. I do have a history of ligament tearing in my ankles and Achilles issues so a stability shoe seems sensible.

Are there any in particular you might recommend for a 72kg 183cm male who is running around 10-15 miles per week? I tried on the ASICS GT 2000(?) which I didn’t like as it seemed to put a lot of pressure in the arch of my foot. I also tried the NB 860v 14 and Saucony Guide 18.

Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this. Novice runner here run 30km per week prepping for half marathon, been running on off for 2 years. Previous shoe was Rebel V4 with 500km no issues felt great. 

Foot is a bit wide and a bit flat, have dealt with arch pain in the past but not for a long time. I am possibly a heel striker but can't be sure.  
Got the Evo SL 2 weeks ago , ran 8k easy (5:40 per km) felt amazing and comfortable. Did another workout which was 12k interval (4:45 km , 800m repeats with rest).

Finally my last run which gave me an injury was the last long run of my training ,18km (5 km easy, 10km HM pace 5:10 per km, and 3 km easy). This run might have been a bit too much too fast. Run felt awesome performed well but was a bit gassed then a few hours later I had knee pain for the first time in my life, outside of the knee pain, seems to be related to the ITB and a lot of soreness in my glutes and hamstring. 

  
Did some stretches and strength training for 5 days, pain subsided just in time for my event yesterday a triathalon with a 5km run. Did the whole thing felt great and during the run I could feel some of my muscles working way harder than normal to keep me stable. My glutes, hips, etc felt a bit sore during the run (perhaps due to the strength training this week).

  
Anyways, my questions is, do you think my pain was caused by over training or is it cause of the new shoe? Is the EVo SL stability issue could cause this kind of pain?

I dont really strength train before the injury and I feel like some of the stability muscles are generally weak which seems to be exemplified when I run with this shoe. Would love any opinion? ",2025-05-11 23:32:02+00:00,4,10

I just joined this group; thanks for having me!

I have had some Achilles issues which, after physio, has ultimately turned into peroneal tendonopothy. The result is intense pain along the bottom left side of my left foot with every step while running. 

I currently run in Hoka Clifton 9’s, and have been running in the same model/size for the past 2 years.

1kk9bqv,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Stability: (Custom) Orthotics vs. Shoes,"Titel says it basically. Short background: Ran my first marathon 6 weeks ago and due to a combination of overstressing, overpronating as well as wearing wrong orthotics in my shoes, I ended up with some quite painful PTT (Posterior Tibialis Tendonitis).

So I did the reasonable (and sad) thing and took some weeks off running, saw a PT, started to do the exercises and had new custom orthotics fit. The orthotics are primarily aimed at stabilizing the ankle / avoiding overpronation.

I also got myself a pair of Saucony Guide 18 - while I really appreciate them, and I just logged 59k in them in my first real week of running again, I also gave them a try in my other shoes, Saucony Endorphin Speed 4, Pro 4 and Puma MagMax Nitro. While the Guide 18 definitely feel best right now, the improvement I could feel in the other shoes would really leave an impression on me. It's like all of these shoes are now so much more stable, while just walking/jogging in any of these (and the Guide 18) without the orthotics feels like a major step back as far as my ankle is concerned. In fact, I am also using the very same orthotics in my everyday walking around shoes (will be a couple of weeks until I can get a second pair).

tl;dr I feel like the impact the orthotics had by far outweighed the shoes'. So to those who maybe had similar stability-related issues as well, what is your take on this?

Is this just typical overuse or is it the shoes, or both for that matter?!

When I was running though, I made sure that my form was decent, (striking underneath my hips, fast cadence, lifting up my legs a little, making sure that my feet were in line with my waist, not striking outwards or inwards, etc), and focusing on strengthening my lower leg muscles to help absorb some of the impact that occurs when running.

I also paid attention to my weekly volume when running, focusing more on making my body adapt to the stress of running, rather than working on my cardio, (I worked on my cardio with other non impact activities such as cycling, swimming and so on).

Now, since my knee is getting better, I've been wanting to get back to running again, but I have some questions regarding which footwear to use.

I read this article not far back ([https://naturalfootgear.com/blogs/educational-articles/the-shoe-cushioning-myth?srsltid=AfmBOoqFXI-P2bAIshMxmK7YQWa3kbeyiiUsZOOX1pjNDbMwzRGlhQTc](https://naturalfootgear.com/blogs/educational-articles/the-shoe-cushioning-myth?srsltid=AfmBOoqFXI-P2bAIshMxmK7YQWa3kbeyiiUsZOOX1pjNDbMwzRGlhQTc)), talking about how excess cushioning is bad for the feet, since it atrophies the muscles in the feet, and it doesn't really absorb the impact that much, it just kinda numbs it. They cite numerous studies, but then again, this article could be biased since they sell minimalist shoes.

I also found studies which support cushioning, ([https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19424280.2018.1501771](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19424280.2018.1501771)), ([https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19424280.2018.1460624](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19424280.2018.1460624))

So I am kinda at a loss, cushioning or no cushioning? And are Converse shoes good options for running? And If not, what good options for footwear are there for someone who struggled with shin splints in the past?  
Right now, I'm kinda leaning more to the side of less cushioning, as I read that minimalist shoes helped some people get rid of their shin splints and can help with flat feet (something I also suffer from). I've read from other posts that some degree of cushioning around maybe 5 to 10mm at most is a good to use for running, and I am intrigued to hear your opinions.  
Also, I have custom soles in the shoes since I have flat feet. They offer a bit more cushioning than the traditional soles in Converse shoes, which I had taken out and replaced with my custom soles.

And if Converse are not a good pick, would minimalist shoes like Merrell Vapor Glove 6 for example, be a smart choice for someone with a history of shin splints?

That would be all, thank you in advance!",2025-05-11 16:59:24+00:00,0,9

1kjzayu,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Puma DN3 regular VS wide,"So my pair of DN3s just arrived and unfortunately they are too narrow and I'm also having heel slip.

This is such a bummer because I had my hopes really high for this shoe. I did a ton of research, got a good deal and it just seemed like the perfect running shoe for me, but the fitting wasn't good.

So I was thinking about getting the wide version, the problem is that in my country they don't sell it, so I'd have to buy it from the US, which would make it even more expensive and also, in case it doesn't fit property, returning it would also cost me more money (international shipping plus taxes).

So, in order to decide if I'm still going to insist on the DN3 or just move on to another option, I'd like to ask of you if the wide version solved this narrowness problem and also ask for suggestions on what shoe I could get as an alternative.

- The same tongue strategy as the Pro4/adios 9 with some little stichting on the side, ending the constant problem of it rolling up
- Same CPU outsole as in the adios 9

They just arrived. But a couple days ago I had an actual injury on a tendon and ended up going to a podiatrist. She found a callus on my right side and she told me I supinate.

My question is, is it possible that I do both? That when I run I overpronate but when I stand I supinate? Would it be harmful to wear the Brooks Adrenaline if I supinate?

I do feel like it's an upgrade from my regular running shoes, since the hard ankle support does feel better. I haven't removed the tags yet, so I could return them and get a supination type of shoes. I'm very unsure because I always feel like my ankle is rolling inwards but maybe it's just the feeling I have because I walk wrong? 

Anyone had similar experience? Is there anyway I can test out better what direction I roll?

1kjm6na,AskRunningShoeGeeks,A shoe like the Nike Vaporfly 3 but with more space for toes,"Hi team, I ran a half marathon and finished at a 1:33:30, which for me is incredible. It was my first time using a carbon plated racer. I had a fitting for the vaporfly 3 and felt strong, quick, and agile in them. I wore them for a few speed runs (8mi total usually) and shorter easy runs to break them in. Felt good overall, with one exception.

The issue is the toe box. It too was narrow and crammed. I figured this would be no major issue, as the rest of my foot felt fine and the shoes worked well for shorter distance. However, when I raced, by mi 11-12, my feet were bleeding and several of my toenails began their journey to purple.

I can’t return the shoe, as it is stained in blood. I plan to use them in flatter speed workouts until they get wore down. However, for my marathon, I’m looking for a new plated shoe. Plated, light weight, and bouncy shoes made too much of a difference to ignore on race day.

My size is 13, with wider feet. I train in New Balance 1080s, but mostly because they’re cushioned and take a good beating during my training arc. They don’t make a good race shoe though, which I know because my 10k pace in them felt hard at 6:56, versus what felt fair at a 7:08 half marathon pace in the fly.

I'm 185 cm tall (6,07ft), 67 kg (148lbs).  
Current PBs:

* 5K: 19:30
* 10K: 39:50

Goals:

* Sub-38 minute 10K by the end of the year
* Sub-3-hour marathon in April 2026.

From now until the end of August, I won’t be focusing too much on running. I’m planning:

* 2 low-intensity bike rides per week (100-120km)
* 2 running sessions focused on speed/intervals
* A lot of swimming (because it's summer!)

So for now, I just need a shoe suited for speed workouts.

From September to December, I’ll train seriously for the 10K, so I’ll need a **daily trainer** suitable for recovery and regular runs.

Then from January to April, I’ll be training for the marathon. I plan to get **one more pair** for that period – a shoe I can use for long runs and the marathon itself (not carbon-plated).

Currently, all my running shoes are worn out, so I’m rebuilding my rotation from scratch.

Here’s what I’m looking for (non-carbon shoes):

* 1 pair for intervals/speed sessions (to help me reach that 38-minute 10K)
* 1 pair for daily/recovery runs
* 1 pair for long runs and the marathon itself

1kj01gk,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Best women's running shoe for long distance trail running prone to stress fractures?,"Hi all,


I've been through the FAQ and can't seem to find an answer that fits my specific needs. I am looking for a new and suitable women's running shoe for myself.


Here is my information:

----------

I have been prone to stress fractures in the past (10+ years ago) but am all healed up now. Had 5 of em in my shin bone and ankle. My number one priority is preventing stress fractures. I have had no issues with shin splints. Only fractures.

----------

I solely do trail running now to try to prevent the fractures. My surfaces throughout my run are dirt and gravel.

----------

I currently run 10 miles once per week. I would ideally like to get to 15. I also run 5ks 2-3 times per week but I could see these going up to 10ks. I am mostly concerned about preventing the stress fractures on that 10+ mile run.

----------

I also have a narrow foot and high arch if that information is helpful.

----------

I have been running on my Brooks PureGrit 7s (2 pairs) for 3 years with no issues. They have been very good to me. But my mileage has never been as high as it is now so I feel I may need a shoe better suited to high mileage. They don't feel very cushioned. It also seems the PureGrit series does not even exist anymore. Is there a replacement for them? Would it make sense with the information I gave to get said replacement?

----------

Any thoughts are highly appreciated as I am very lost and overwhelmed with all of the new shoes and features out there.

1kiw5si,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Puma MagMax Nitro - Adding to rotation as a slow daily,"Hi All, 

I've been researching shoes to add to my rotation as a slow/recovery run trainer. Currently I have the Puma Deviate Nitro 3, which is a perfect fit for me and I love running in them. Recently set my PB 10k of 45:05 and am looking at sticking with them as a tempo/fast paced trainer and race shoe as I try and go for sub-45.

I was thinking of picking up a pair of slower, cushioned shoes to use as a recovery run and slow run trainer, basically something I can rotate with the Deviates when I just want to relax. I've been tossing up between the common max stack cushioned shoes i.e NB5, SB2, Vom18, Brooks GM2 etc but keep coming back to the MagMax, mainly due to my good experience with Puma so far and not so good past experience with Asics. 

Bit of context, I'm mainly a tennis player, and have always used Nike tennis shoes, they just fit/work/feel the best for me (bar durability), had a few running shoes from them too and have liked them. I've never been a fan of Asics or Adidas tennis shoes, and have limited experience with Asics running shoes but that experience wasn't that good. So I'm not super against using them but am definitely not swinging that way. 

To tell the truth I'm really just looking for validation that the MagMax would be a good option for me lol. Would it make sense to have both the Deviate Nitro 3 and the MagMax in the same rotation or would you just stick with the Deviate Nitro 3 for everything? (Which I'm sure it could handle, just would be nice to have a second pair to rotate and reduce wear, and something a bit softer) Anyone have experience running in both these shoes and can really shed some light on the differences in feel, pace, comfort and fit?

*Can't really try them first as no one stocks them in my area.

**I'm about 173cm, 60kg, generally 10k race pace is 4:20-30min/km, tempo pace is around 4:45-55min/km and slow runs are 5:40-6min/km.

1kit9nj,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Novablast 5 vs Neo Zen vs Aero Glide,"Do you guys agree? I've ran 60 km with each ones so I may be prematurely coming to conclusions.

\+ Neo Zen, initial Miles in Neo Zen are fun, there is bounce to this shoe that most rave about, too sloppy with the large surface to actually pick up the pace. But the zone two miles were a blast until they weren't.

\- Neo Zen Bottomed out at km 18 or mile 11 for me on longer runs and I'm a light runner (140lb), it loses its bounce at around that distance, the last shoe I had that issue with was the Rebel V3, the Neo Zen is here for a good time not a long time idea. The Upper is loose in comparison to its bigger brother the Neo Vista which hugged the ankle better, upper felt sloppy and not the most stable option out there, could see where they compromised quality for price.

\+ Aeroglide 3 has a pop that makes the easy miles enjoyable, more of a ground feel than the others, Tried hitting marathon pace with them once, no chance. It is a lively shoe and I imagine if sized properly, it could be solid, reminded me a bit of the early reebok floatrides, just an enjoyable cruiser for fresh legs or those who are used to having more ground feel. Only did 16km as my longest run in them, but may not have the underfoot protection required for any long runs.

\- Aeroglide 3 runs looooong, would have sized down had I not ordered it online. Its a trend with most salomon models, should have known better. Not pleasant at recovery paces, tried running on them on fatigued legs and was not pleased.

\+Novablast 5, Lively, well cushioned large platform, the most versatile model out of the 3, not only pleasant on daily runs, recovery runs but can go the distance, long runs were solid and did an above average job at maintaining my legs fresh even after a 30km run, Superblast 2 is still the long distance king.

\-Novablast 5, I could hold marathon pace (3:42/km for me and felt like I was cruising, anything faster than that it felt clunky and cumbersome. I don't care what anyone says the Novablast 4 despite being less soft and bouncy felt fluid at my half marathon pace (3:20/km). This iteration compromised speed for softness, not my cup of tea but to each their own.

1kiph2v,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Adidas supernova rise sizing issue. need advise,"Backstory: 
I had a cumulus 23 in a uk8 (270cm) that I discarded because my feet hurt too much ..I think they were just very snug around  the midfoot though the toebox width was ok. I could have probably used a tiny bit more room iibh. 
Borrowed a friend's nimbus 25, uk8.5, for a few days and my feet were swimming in them. There was pain in my knee, my heel weren't locked down, I twisted my ankle etc.. just not for me I guess

Tried the adizero sl2 at the store. Uk was too tight and my feet were falling in and uk 10 was too big. My heel was slipping out. I figured UK9.5 was my size in adizero sl2 which means a regular adidas like the Rise would be fine with uk9. (We dontbhave half sizes here)

 Afterall, I'm coming from an Asics uk8 (270cm, Eu42) which was too tight and my Asics casual sneakers are Uk8.5(275cm, Eu42.5) and they fit me perfectly.. so it all makes sense.

Current story:

Waited for a few days after getting tired of searching and took the plunge and bought the supernova rise in Uk9(also 275cm like the Asics uk8.5)
Length seemed fine, Width seemed fine at home.l and just walking around.
 but now that I have it without tags  and I took them for a real walk and run, I can immediately tell that these are small for me.. like it feels like there isn't enough shoe covering my foot (like it's just halfway out) and the midfoot is too snug (I have to really loosen up all the laces) and my toe might be touching the front at times (even though there is enough space when measuring)

Now I can't return them. But maybe I could strike a deal  to have them exchanged for a uk10 (285cm, eu45). But I don't know how will that give me more volume on the shoe.. and I don't know if it will just be too big or my heel would move around or not. plus I'm already going going from a uk8.5 to uk9 and the lack of a 9.5 is making me have to jump to a 10. 

What should I do??? Should I try and get them to exchange the shoe and perhaps even pay more money?

The other option is to use the shoe without an insole(or use a very thin one). Cuz I removed the insole and immediately I could tell the difference. Suddenly the shoe felt like how it's supposed to fit (the supernova insole is quite thick too)",2025-05-09 18:21:00+00:00,1,1
1kio2vf,AskRunningShoeGeeks,shoe suggestion for novice runner training for a marathon,"After never running in my life, I started with couch to 5k last year. During the course of running, i've had numerous injuries. Recently ran a ten miler (was my first race ever) with very limited training because of my injuries, and want to train for a marathon thats being held in november. Ran about a 9:30 min/mile pace for my ten miler.

Went to a running store to get my gait analyzed.  The person said that my running form was fairly neutral, slightly flat feet,  and  I was fitted with Brooks glycerin gts as my first shoe... reason being that as a new runner,  I needed a supportive shoe that would prevent injuries. I hated how the shoe felt and dont really use them.  



I also tried the Asics GT-2000, and ended up really liking them and have used them as my main running shoe.

Im looking for new shoes to use as my daily running shoes. I am at 12 mpw right now, and will be ramping that up during the course of the next 5-6 months training for the marathon.

I would say that I am a little more susceptible to injuries than your typical runner. I have very very poor flexibility and am generally very weak and have weak core strength. I am really making a concerted effort to take it easy and perform strength exercises and stretch to prevent injuries.

1kilqxy,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Concern about blisters caused by seemingly comfortable shoes,"Hi everyone, I’m a beginner runner, so apologies in advance for what might be a silly question — but I’d like to understand whether what I’m experiencing is normal or if I was given the wrong advice.

A couple of weeks ago, tired of running with cheap shoes, I decided to visit a specialized store. After checking how I walk, they recommended a pair of ‘stability’ shoes (also because I’m a beginner, I run quite slowly, and I’m slightly overweight). The shoes in question are the Asics GT-2000 13. I found them very comfortable right away, but the problem is that, having never worn shoes with such a wide sole, I developed blisters under the forefoot on the inner side and that seems not stopping soon for some reason.

Is this normal with new shoes? I’m starting to overthink it and would really like to know whether they’re suitable for my running style. Unfortunately, I really struggle to tell whether I overpronate or supinate when I run. If that area of my foot hurts when I run, is it somehow related to my running style? And if so, to which one? Thanks in advance to anyone who replies!


EDIT: To clarify I read the Wiki, I’m not asking how to solve Blisters Problem, but if it is related to my running style which doesn’t match shoe type. I’m asking this cause it’s my first time having blisters in that spot for a long time after the purchase. ",2025-05-09 15:47:07+00:00,2,8
1kili57,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Boston 13 vs EVO SL vs Boston 12,"Do you guys agree?

Couple runs in on the Boston 13 and I have been pleasantly surprised. Far better than the Boston 12 which still felt harsh on foot and that upper was problematic (Both issues seem to be resolved in the new iteration, with a softer midsole while maintaining ground feel and an improved upper). Would like to know if you guys agree or disagree with my conclusions.

\+Boston 13 is far more stable, The platform is larger on forefoot and heel would make it more suitable on for long run in my opinion. (However, I do have a feeling the EVO SL midsole is more protective over the distance as I have felt sore legs after a 15 mile run on the Boston 13)

\+The Lighstrike Pro foam on the forefoot is more propulsive on the forefoot of the Boston 13 than the EVO SL. The EVO SL has a sloppy forefoot in my opinion which is more cushioned but not responsive as the Boston 13.

\- The EVO SL has an aggressive toe off and the Boston is flatter at forefoot, the EVO SL geometry promotes a smoother in transition. 

\- The Boston 13 has a wider toe box which could be a positive for some. I prefer the snug, performance fit offered on the EVO SL.",2025-05-09 15:37:05+00:00,110,39

1kigz4u,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Aero Glide 3 confusion!,"
I just got the Aero Glide 3 today.

5’11” (181), 205 lbs (93 kgs), midfoot striker.

Amateur runner. Paces can vary widely but my easy runs tend to hover between 8:30 to 11 min/mile depending on fatigue levels and weather. Let’s just average it to 9:30 over a half marathon distance (pretty slow pace). I’m by no means a fast runner especially since I got into long distance running in the last couple of years. I used to be exclusively a 5k/10k runner.

Enough with the intro here’s my impression of the shoe:

Upper Good quality. Roomy (maybe a little too much but it doesn’t bother me). I have a very average sized foot and despite going a half size down, the upper was still a tad on the large side even in terms of length. Laces are a little too long but that’s more of a nitpick. Pretty light shoe overall.

Midsole That’s surprisingly where I have a bit of a problem. After watching all of these reviews I expected a bit more out of this. It’s much more firm than I expected and less energy return than I was led to believe from watching a bunch of youtube videos. I don’t know if these shoes require a break-in period but I found the foam to be…. Dare I say non-responsive. This is very strange to me considering that I’m a heavy runner and I usually hover towards slightly firmer shoes so I don’t bottom out. it’s great that I indeed do not bottom out but it’s as if the foam barely compresses with my type of stride. It’s almost as if I’m heaving the same problem many people do with the Superblast 2 (also a very divisive shoe). I went on an 8 mile run and despite subjectively having a decent pace, the sole of my feet started feeling a little sore at the 5-6 mile mark. My legs feel great on the other hand and none of my muscles or joints feel any strain. I’m wondering if the stock ortholite sole is too firm. I have no idea why but I’m not exactly vibing with this foam. I would like some people’s testimony of whether the foam gets softer after some mileage. I artificially started to heel strike and that’s when I felt the foam come to life. Also, even striking with the midfoot, the foam felt much better when picking up the pace. However trotting slowly the shoe felt a bit too boring. I’m not feeling what all of these reviewers are (Yowana, Kofuzi, Doctors of running). I came from the Hoka Mach 6 and I absolutely loved that shoe but the foam now feels nearly dead at about 300 miles and I did all of my types of runs in that shoe. I wanted something with more stack and I’m thinking about returning the Aero Glide 3 and getting the Evo SL instead (I don’t have stability issues with it). I will keep the Aero Glide 3 if indeed there is a break-in period and the foam gets softer and more responsive.

Outsole Great. Nothing to say here.

I’m honestly very disappointed and maybe the hype was blown out of proportion. I also understand that not all people react the same way to certain shoes so perhaps I’m in the minority here. The shoe feels slightly like a brick and it is by no means a bad daily trainer. Am I the only one to have such an experience of the Aero Glide 3?",2025-05-09 12:13:42+00:00,2,3

So I took people’s advice and went to a running shoe store to be properly fitted. For reference I’m an inconsistent runner on and off for years trying to become consistent.

1ki0at1,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Asics Gel Kayano 29 Calf Pain,"Hi everyone!!

I need advice 🥲

I recently bought my 1st pair of decent shoes, and I went with the Asics Gel Kayano 29. I tried them on the store and they felt really confortable and I got a great price for them. I've also tried the Asics Novablast 4 and really liked them too, but since I'm a very slow runner I didn't think those made a lot of sense for me.

Never did a gait analysis btw, the only reason why I thought the Kayano were a good idea is because I tend to have plantar fasciatis on my right foot with very flat shoes.

I did my 1st run with them this week and it was one of the worst runs of my life, I was in pain after running for only 3 minutes and I couldnt even do the run I set myself to do that day. I did my 2nd one today and I ran even less than the 1st time. The calf pain I've been feeling with them is out of this world and I don't want to push them into an injury.

They're fine for walking, my calfs are fine, I simply cannot run for long with them. 

I recognize I'm not the best runner (doing C25K), but I could run a lot more without pain with my old cheap Fila, and thats what I want, to run more milage and I can't with these.

Should I keep these and use them to train calfs and do shorter runs, or should I sell them? I don't know if they're not made for me or if I'm just a bit bad at running? Idk

I might buy the novablast but I'm so traumatized, I fear they'll feel the same. I'm so sad and disapointed 🥲",2025-05-08 20:26:25+00:00,1,6

Hello! 

First of all, sorry for my English it’s not my mother tongue :)

I’m M26 and running 5 times per week for ca 50km (which will increase progressively to 70 km as I started my 2nd marathon training plan)

Currently my rotation shoes are :

- magic speed 4 for tempo run 
- Adios pro 3 for intervals
- superblast 2 for long run 
- Adios pro 4 for race day 

I would like your thought of this because I love so much the AP4 and found too firm the MS4.

I’m thinking of replacing the MS4 by a second pair of AP4 and using them for intervals and long runs when I’ve to speed up during them

I am not sure if it is a good idea because I will surely lose the magic if I wear the AP4 every week but they feel so good

1khe7nn,AskRunningShoeGeeks,"Which Tempo trainer: MS4, DN3, ZF6, Evo SL","Hey everyone trying to decide on a new shoe for tempo runs.

Current rotation: NB5 for easy days (will be retiring), Neo vista for tempo and easy days (will be mostly for easy days now), SB2 for long runs 12+ miles, adios pro 3 for races

Usual tempo runs are 6-10 miles with intervals of 1+ mile at 6-7:00/mi pace in a hilly park

Originally was planning to get Evo SL but with the neo vistas and SB2 maybe I should get a carbon plated trainer.

I’ve liked asics in the past NB4/5, SB2 all fit well so I was considering magic speed but I wouldn’t mind trying other brands: the DN3 and ZF6 also seem like good options.

I am a lighter runner (60kg) with a rear foot striking pattern and over pronation. I am currently searching for a durable daily trainer that can handle most of my runs.
I would pair it with the Brooks Hyperion and Puma Deviate Nitro 2.

I have been eyeing the Mizuno Wave Rider 28 and its many very positive reviews. I have been able to try it, and found it quite nice.
BUT : It has a 12mm drop, which I am not used to, all my previous shoes being around 8mm.
I regularly experience pain on the medial side of my lower shin, a few centimeters above the malleola, during and right after some runs…
I have been told that a higher drop could make this pain even worse ?

So do you guys think it would be a bad decision to go with the WR28 ?
I have also considered the Skyrise 6, which is 8mm drop but significantly softer…

What is the stack height of the Zoom Fly 6? Runrepeat has them at 40mm, so race legal. They are also NOT on the Ironman ban list, so I assume they should be fine.

1kh47os,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Let’s talk about Superblast 2 (again).,"Not a question at all, tried to post this at Runningshoegeeks and asked to post here instead. 

Already close to 200K in mine so I have a pretty solid idea about the shoes. 

In the recent past, I read some people complaining about the Superblasts and I got me thinking that the issue may arise from a misconception of what the shoes do and don’t do. I was initially in the same spectrum, I actually put them up for sale after the first long run but decided to keep them for a bit longer. And I truly understood what these shoes are for. 

Having NB4 in my rotation amongst a coupe of other pairs and 300K on them before I got the SB2, I couldn’t help comparing SB2 to NB4. Are the SB2 bouncy? No. Are they returning much energy? No. Do they fell cushioned? No. They are actually the firmest shoes in my rotation and would never buy them if it wasn’t for people praising them here. But that’s not what the SB2 are for. My understanding is that they are for (somehow magically) keeping your feet feeling fresh and rested after a run. And that’s why they are considered the goats for long runs. An example would be my long run this past Sunday. I went out for a 2hr, zone 2 long run and by the evening, my legs felt like I’ve never gone out running in the morning. I felt ready to go out for another 2hr long run if I wanted to. 

Of course there are people that find the shoe not fitting their legs right (I can relate, adidas Evo sl for example are just not made for my feet at all), or not meeting some specific needs. But SB2 will probably never feel ‘inviting’ to me at least, it’s the after run feeling that this shoe is made for. 

Apologies for any text mistake. English is not my mother language. 

Ps. I actually got my 10K and half marathon PRs  wearing the SB2. I’ve never run over a half marathon but I m training for competing a sub4 marathon in 6 months and trying out 80-120K ultras by next year.

1kh0ara,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Saucony Ride 18 Achilles pain?,"Hi all. So. I’m a fairly heavy runner (6’3”, 215lbs). I have a fairly wide foot, with a very tall instep and high arches. I am a forefoot striker (atleast when I’m not overly tired) and tend to land on the outside of my feet. I tend to gravitate to firmer shoes, or atleast not ultra plush. I think because of my weight, the ultra plush shoes just feel a little unstable to me as I collapse the foam more than a lighter runner would. I’ve had lots of success with Brooks Ghost and New Balance 880. Especially when the 880 had a little higher drop. 

In any case, I recently purchased some Saucony Ride 18 (13D). I love the initial feel of the upper and it’s a little softer than I’m used to. But the overall platform is wide and I appreciated that. The shoe has an 8mm drop, which is a little lower than my standard 10-12. But I figured it would be fine still. 

However, I’ve gone on some long walks and it is bothering my Achilles. It almost feels like it has a negative drop when I’m walking and is causing my Achilles to stretch. Am I crazy that it feels this way?

The drop is still 8mm so I figured that would still be plenty high. But when I walk, I can feel it stretching my Achilles. It feels like it’s stretching my Achilles more than even walking barefoot. Hence why I say negative. 

It’s really throwing me for a loop. Has anyone else felt this while walking? What am I missing here?

However, a lot of reviews online rank the cushioning of evo sl as high compared to boston 12 which is usually described as firm.
Looking at foam hardness measurements (on runrepeat) these two shoes are about the same for their lightstrike pro layer. Boston 12 layer of lightstrike (non-pro) is measured as softer than lightstrike pro which I would expect should make b12 softer than evo sl however this doesn’t seem to be the case from reviewers.

I am stuck between two sizes of the Nike Zoom fly 6. I ordered them in UK 11 and 11.5. My right foot is a little wider than the left one, especially on the little toe.

The 11s are really comfy and have a tight but snug fit. But my little toe is pressed against the outside of the shoe. It is not too bad but I can feel it all the time and it is unpleasant after a while even without running. Sometimes it hurts a bit, sometimes it is just unpleasant. I also removed the insoles and the little toe is overlapping the insole. There are no problems with the big toe and the left shoe is fitting perfectly. Does the upper material adjusts during runs or will it get worse due to swollen foots ? 

The 11.5 are also very comfy. I have to tie them tighter for good fit, but they feel a little long and the toe box feels little wide. Not much, just a tiny bit. The forefoot is also a little wiggly, mid foot and heels are with a secure fit. Same for the left foot. So they are really comfy and I feel as I can run in them, but I get better grip inside the smaller ones and I do not know if they are too large for running longer distances (5-10 km) as I do not know how they behave and how running shoes should fit.

I'm trying to decide between two sizes for a new pair of running shoes and could use some advice:

**EU 45 (US 11):**  
✅ Feels perfect on my feet  
✅ Matches the size recommended by the shop.  
⚠️ I can feel my toes slightly touching the upper box, and in general - I'm afraid it's too close to the end. I’m worried this might become a problem during longer runs or downhill sections because my foot tends to go much forward.

**EU 46 (US 11.5)** \- also tried with heel lock lacing.  
✅ More room for my toes, which feels better  
✅ This is also my size in another running shoe (Saucony)  
✅ I’ve generally worn slightly bigger shoes all my life  
⚠️ A bit roomier overall — not quite as snug and perfect as the EU 45

In the picture (attached), you can see how much space I have in the 46 — my thumb fits between my toes and the front of the shoe.

I'm approaching 500k in my Novablast 5's and that's my do it all shoe at the moment. I'm only a runner since October '24 and the only occasion I rotate my NB5 is for the Pegasus 41 that I only use for rainy days (since they are a bit short in length).

Now I'm at the point that I want to add another shoe to rotate with the NB5 so my idea was to keep using the NB5 for easy/zone 2/some long runs and add a new faster shoe that would be better suited for tempo/fartlek runs, race day and also long runs. I also want the shoe to be good for my first (race) half marathon in October, but I think even the NB5 would be enough for that purpose. If relevant, my easy/zone 2 run paces are between 6'30-5'30 per km, and when doing tempo/fartlek I'm usually pushing to 4'20-4'00ish.

I've been looking towards the Adidas Evo SL and the Nike Zoom Fly 6 which despite being very different, I think both would suit the purpose in different ways. Tried the Evo SL yesterday and the fit felt great, but unfortunately here in Lisbon I'm not sure I'll find the ZF6 instore to try them out. I'm also worried about the fact that the ZF6 are plated, heard some people say that it is only worth it if you push further that 4'00/km and that it isn't great for regular use.

During this break I got a bad mood and never got back from the injuries, eaten bad and never done sport for real, leading to an increase in weight and loss of muscle.

I’m now 23 y/o at 103kg, and when I used to play basketball and run I was 20 y/o and 95/98 Kg depending on the time of the year. I now want to get back to run and maybe do a couple of races later this year.

I used to run this times (PB)

5K = 19 minutes 58 seconds (now 23 minutes and 20 seconds)

10K = 44 minutes sharp (now 52 and 10 seconds)

Now, into the questions:

1. As of now I'm following my old plan to improve 5k/10k times, which have a tempo run, an easy run, a long run and intervals per week. I have in total 3 pairs of shoes: Brook hyperion tempo (using them for tempo runs) , a pair of asics with flytefoam (long and easy runs) and a pair of Nike zoom alphafly next 2 (race day back in the day, now i use them just for intervals. But i plan to start racing again). All of them have at least 2 years, since i remember buying the alphafly just right before breaking my second knee. Are those still good or should i get new pairs? is my usage of them right for the type of run?
2. Yesterday i've done intervals, and noticed that the glue of my alphafly is loosing, here are a couple of pics:

Some info before questions: I'm a casual runner who does 2-3k km a year, usually at quite slow paces (5:00 - 6:30/km). I do a mix of trail and road and typically participate in 2-3 trail ""races"" a year, mostly in the 20-30k range, with the occasional ultra.  I've running since 2018 and never had my gait looked at, which is why I'm excited about this forum after reading a number of other posts.  Now, onto my questions...

Pictured on the left are Asics Cumulus 23 with 500km and the right are Asics Trabuco 9 with 620km (pardon the trail grit). The Trabuco's are about ready to be replaced though I've been able to get 800+ on a pair previously, I base it on the feel while running. I'm curious on this subs thoughts around the wear patterns. I have historically found that neutral or neutral/underpronation shoes feel the best on my feet and lead to the least fatigue. 

I'm especially interested in thoughts on the right heal wear, this is very pronounced on the Trabuco pair. Interestingly I'm recovering right now from a right leg injury (periostitis) which took me out for a good 6 weeks, thankfully I'm back to every other day running now. Could there be a correlation between what I assume is extra heal strike/dragging on the right foot based on this wear?

I love the SL2 as a trusty lightweight daily trainer, and was hoping to take them to 300 or 350 miles. They seemed to retain most of their pep and bounce through 200 miles, so I was optimistic. But on my last run, they literally felt like some evil mastermind had merged a running upper with a pair of 90s Tevas. 

I’ve seen a lot of complaints about shoes like the Rebel V4 losing their resilience at 200 miles or less, and the longevity of my SL2s was equally disappointing. Are we being asked to accept 200 miles as the standard longevity for the $140-150 daily trainer category? I wonder if it’s more about race-oriented (and less durable) foams being used increasingly in training shoes, or whether it’s an industry-driven push to get us to buy new shoes more frequently. Both?

1kgi108,AskRunningShoeGeeks,What’s the difference in these shoes?,"Been dealing with soleus tension while running for the last several months and its prevented me from working up to my first marathon. Seems to always set in around 1-2 miles and by 2.5-3 miles the strain is so great I have to stop or risk injury. I’ve tried just about everything I can think of: taking time off, stretching, strengthening, different shoes, etc. Nothing seems to help me get over that 2 mile hurdle. 

Recently purchased some Saucony Ride 18s. When running in them my calf tension sets in even sooner and harder than with any other shoe I’ve tried. This noticeable difference leads me to believe the shoes may be my issue, or at least part of it. Feel like understanding why could add a piece to the puzzle. My comparison shoes are Brooks Ghost Max and some Hoka Clifton 8s. Of the 3 the Clifton’s feel the best on my calves, but they are old as hell and probably have 500+ miles on them, so I don’t think they’d be good for comparison unless someone thinks otherwise. I would say the Brooks are just slightly worse than the Hokas. 

So the question is, what’s the difference between these shoes? What could it be about the Saucony’s compared to the others that are causing greater soleus tension? 

For added context: I believe I’m more of a mid/forefoot striker. First contact is usually the ball of my foot or slightly behind it. I’ve done a few half marathons in the past, so these shorter distances are nothing foreign to me.",2025-05-06 22:43:27+00:00,1,2

Hi all,

Long story short: I used to be an avid runner back in 2021-2022 but due to 3 surgeries of my hip bone region causing limited mobility, I lost all motivation to run. I tried to go back but the will to continue running never came back. This year because of weight increase and health issues, the doctor suggested to start cardio again so I am heading back to running from next week onwards. So...

Back then I used to have only 1 pair of running shoe which was Adidas Duramo Lite 2, which was an okay shoe but had terrible cushioning. I made use of to run 5k-10k but the feet used to get sore. But since back then my aim was to get into running, so it worked out for me. Now I want to get better shoes and after doing a lot of research, ended up with 2 shoes to use in rotation: NB Fresh Foam 1080v14 and ASICS Dynablast 5. I found both of them at a good price but obviously can return them they don't work well together. So, can I use these shoes in rotation or do I need to include something else? I would be running on roads and my aim is 5k to eventually 10k  and want to make both these shoes last about 1-1.5 years. Please let me know your opinion.",2025-05-06 17:30:54+00:00,0,1

I know her store carries a bunch of brands, but not all of them.  I would like to pre-buy and bring along \~2 pair of shoes for her to watch me run in, in addition to what she has in the store.

About me:

49M, running about 50-60 mpw year round, with a peak of 75 miles.  Been running for 12 years, 8 road marathons with a PR of 3:16 in 2022.  Finished three trail ultras in the last year including a 100 miler and most recently a backyard ultra where I went 26 hours.  I do about 75% of my miles on roads / paved paths and the remainder on trails.  Speed work two days a week.  I'm not winning any races, but I do appreciate lofty goals, working for them, and doing better than last time.

Current shoes:

Road: Brooks Launch for about 3 years, with Spenco RX Arch Supports. Trail: Brooks Cascadia with same arch supports.  All of this recommended by gait analyst mentioned above.  I lace up using the heel lock method, and I wear Injinji toe socks.

Situation:

I'm not a big fan of the Cascadia.  They're a big clunky, I stub my right toe a bit too frequently.  Toes tend to rub - the inside of my large toe and sometimes the outside of my small toe.  I ran in a pair of Saucony Peregrine 11s that I liked, but apparently newer models are narrower in the toe box.    

I feel like there may be something better out there for me.

My needs:

I have tried zero drop road shoes, and didn't like them (Altra Torin).  I do have a history (years ago) of neuromas, so I prefer a wider toe box (but not a size wide shoe).  I want to train (on trails) and trail race in the same shoe.  I have another trail 100 miler this fall, and would like to implement a shoe change (if necessary) by July 4. 

I've read about some not-so-common trail shoe brands (Inov8, Terrex, Topo, etc) but I have no idea where to start.  Any ideas on a trail shoe to try based on the above?  I'm thinking I'll order them up, bring them to the gait analysis, and see what we think.  If they're not the shoe for me, I'll return them.",2025-05-06 16:55:17+00:00,0,3

The field I play on has grass about 1 - 2 inches long so I'd be looking for a shoe that can grip that kind of terrain pretty well. I'm not really expecting the shoe to be able to come to a hard stop but something that will allow me to have a running jump approach without me having to worry about sliding and falling over would be nice.

I'd also like for the shoe to have some pretty decent impact protection whilst still remaining stable but I understand this is a bit of an ask for my budget. I think I'd rather have a stable shoe with some impact protection compared to an unstable but super protective shoe. From the research I did, I found a lot of cushioning for running shoes focuses on the heel, however, I rarely use my heels so would like the cushioning to be more centred around the forefoot.

**Easy and Long Run Shoe:** I recently switched to the Saucony Guide 18s, I love them. I overpronate on one foot but am not injury prone.

**Workout, Progression Long Run, and HM Race Day Shoe:** My current ""quicker"" shoes are the Asics Magic Speed 2s. They were great at first and helped with a big PR the first time I raced with them, but feel a bit loud/slappy and I like them less as they age.

**What next?** Reading the wiki and dozens of helpful posts on the subreddit, the obvious second shoe is the Endorphin Speed 4s - but I tried them on at my local store and didn't get the hype.

1kfvmj6,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Trying new things after Hokas Arahi 7 and Skyflow,"So I've only been running for about a year now. Started with a friend who was a die hard Hoka fan so i started there. For context, i mostly do road running with some compacted earth easy trails. First pair were the Arahi 7s and they destroyed my feet. Fit was nice and wide. I did like the firmness and responsiveness (personal preference as im a barefoot shoe fan) but i was new to running and didnt know how much it would impact my feet but my feet didnt tire. Where i have issues is the ""arch support"" left my arches blistered and if i pushed through it would be the entire inside of my foot.  I ended up converting them to my everyday shoe because, they were much more comfortable for standing around. After that, i got skyflows. My feet are not used to the cushioning and my feet hurt way more after running. They feel a bit narrow, but it might just be that im not used to the snug fit. And now i get knee pain, mostly in my right knee (more on that later). The bruising isnt as bad in skyflows as in the arahi, but it still limits my longer distance running.

I was looking through online stuff and found and old post about some active foot design in Hokas, and i kinda suspect that's to blame as the bruising is in my arches. That small arch support just doesnt work for me, but im also new and relatively inexperienced so i wont rule out other possibilities. Anyway i started looking into other shoes, altras and asics mostly. But i also found info about the shoe drop. Im used to 0 drop shoes, and expected Hokas to have a bigger drop, but theyre low. Which makes me second guess transitioning to a different running shoe. And how the drop might affect me. 

All that being said, i thought this would be a good place to hear opinions from more dedicated runners who may have had similar experiences and your recommendations. Im generally a forefoot runner, but my right foot falls asleep, then i transition to rolling throught the heel (imbalance from and injury, im working on it). I like wider firmer shoes. But i do live in a arid rocky place so even trail running is like concrete. i think something more cushioned than the arahis would benefit me because honestly the arch is my main complaint with them. What does anyone else here think? Im hoping to replace my shoes in the coming weeks. I've used the arahi to rags and the skyflow are still good but not meeting expectations, but i think I'll survive in them.",2025-05-06 04:06:46+00:00,1,1

Aiming for 1:45 and I’m pretty on track as per my training schedule! But every little bit helps so I’ve been thinking about the details.

Now I’m wondering about race day shoes… I’ve never had plated shoes and wondering if it’s worth considering the Saucony Endorphin Speed 4s? I also considered the Endorphin Pros but it sounds like maybe the Speed 4s might be easier to ease into a faster shoe without going for a full carbon plate. 

A few things I‘m wondering - should I stick with what I know and run in my Rides? Try out a plated shoe for race day? And if I switch the shoes, any recommendations? Does it make sense to train in them before race day for a few of my last long runs to make sure there are no hiccups? 

Thanks in advance from a total newbie to the world of running shoes :)",2025-05-06 02:41:49+00:00,4,2
1kfroj2,AskRunningShoeGeeks,NB 880 V15 vs Brooks Ghost 17,"As the title suggests, I’m trying to decide.

I’ve been wearing the 880 V14 for a while. I like them because they’re anatomical and come in 2E in all colors. They’re slightly firmer than I’d like (1080s are way too soft though); I’m interested in pebax. I have a pretty wide forefoot and super wide midfoot.

Any thoughts? The Ghost seems nice, but I haven’t run in Brooks for a while. Are these shoes comparable in firmness and shape?

5k at 29:XX minutes

16k at 1:47 ish 

Rotation:
Ortuseight Hyperfuse (daily)
361 Flame 2.5 (tempo/race)
Mizuno Neo Vista (easy/long)

I bought the neo vista in Japan thinking that I can use it like the superblast and get away with using it as a race day shoe. I saw a handful of reviews saying it feels great at their easy pace which ranges 6-7min/km. Since that's my tempo/race pace I thought I could get away with it but I have now failed 2 10ks at my goal HM pace which is 6:52/km. 40 seconds slower than my 10k PR pace. I get so gassed 5k in but was able to complete that same workout easily with my 361.

The problem with my 361 is that it's nearing the end of it's life so I'm looking for another shoe to replace it with.

1kfpv5g,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Advice re: potential manufacturing error,"Salomon XT6

Unsure if this is the right place but just looking for some opinions and if anyone has experienced anything similar

Been wanting a pair of these for a good year now but they've gotten so expensive, finally took the dive and spent 180 on a pair of Goretex S Labs and noticed out the box that the upper seemed to be peeling. They were a limited colour (I think?) and after hours of looking I found a pair in my size on Natterjacks. Couldn't find them anywhere else and decided to keep them as at first seemed a very minor issue and they were such a nightmare to find. Was just happy to finally have a pair.

I've had them less than a week now and the upper on the right shoe has almost completely peeled from the front and it's moving further back as this happens. The left shoe is completely fine and fits better, too as the seal holds the shape. Really can't imagine this is due to wear as it's on one shoe and has happened so fast? Literally within five days of general wear for groceries and trips into the city.

They've offered to accept a return and send on to Salomon but can't replace them as they're fully sold out; they have also said they can't guarantee a refund as it's at Salomon's discretion. I really don't like that solution (end of losing the shoed and potentially the money on top?) but am unsure if this can be remedied at home or maybe fixed by taking into a shoe repair shop?",2025-05-05 23:11:51+00:00,1,1

I'm going to start training for a 3:30 FM following one of the training plans of the marathon handbook.

Some background: male, 45, neutral runner for about 3 years with some back problems.
Current PB:  
5k : 21:31, 10k : 44:29,  HM : 1:43:10, FM : 3:50:28
Current shoes: 
tempo/interval: Saucony ES4
long run/ daily: Brooks Glycerin 21 (this one needs to be replaced and not so happy anymore with this shoe)
Race: Saucony EP4

At his moment I'm training 4 days but this will be going to 6. 1 tempo/interval(pace around 4:20-4:40/km)l, 1 long run (pace around 5:15/km) and 4 daily runs (pace around 4:50/km)

Which shoe would you advise for the daily runs and long run? For the long run I tuinkast I need a shoe with great comfort but also to get some fast pace. As for the daily runs a shoe that's more allround but not to firm. Both must also have some durabillity and not to small at the toes.
At this moment I was thinking about the Saucony ride 18 or Mizuno Neo Zen for a daily trainer and the Brooks Glycerin max for the long runs.

Thanks in advance for your advise.

As per title - i am in desperate need for a slow shoe !
Stats: M, 55, 187cm, 80kg. HM 1:45h

Shoe rotation is AP3 for racing, TS9/10 for track workouts, Boston 12 / ES3 / Velocity Nitro 3 for everything else.

My issue is that all my ""easy"" shoes make me go too fast. I should run around 6min/km for easy/long runs, but they always push me towards 5:30is. Just cant run slower or make smaller steps.

I tried Clifton 9 and found them super boring. Probably pure EVA is just not for me anymore.

I really enjoy the rockered ride of the ES3, love the nitro foam of the Velocity, but they all make me want to go fast.

Next issue is uppers, i live in greece and temperatures are already well above 30C, so that brings limitations to potential options.

Before anyone says anything... Impossible to get Superblast here, especially in my size (47-48 depending on brand).

I am considering (from what is available here):
- puma magnify/magmax/foreverrun
- nike vomero 18 / plus
- asics glideride max
- salomon aero glide 3
- Mizuno Neo Zen

As mentioned before, i love the lively foams so i guess its not easy to find a slow one, same for the rockered/rolling ride.

1kf6c9c,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Has Hoka improved their EVA in the last couple of years? (Skyward X worries),"I have a pair of Hoka mach 4's. Hoped they are going to be the shoes that get me into running a couple of years ago, but they never felt good. I chalked it up to my 112 kg at the time.

Now that I'm down to 96, thought I have to try again, this time with a plush one, so a pair of skywards is on the way.

Now just out of curiosity I looked up a [mach 4 review](https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/comments/n713sf/mach_4400_mile_shoe_review/). I recognize it all, felt pretty similar to me. What got me a bit scared though is the massive consensus about their EVA midsoles dying very quickly.

I don't mean wear and tear of contact surfaces, but the other complaint: the midsole wearing out, stopping to provide adequate cushioning and the shoes feeling dead prematurely.

Because the Skyward also has an EVA layer... and it costs a whole bunch of money. So I hope I'm not spending it on something half of what will die on me prematurely.",2025-05-05 08:13:17+00:00,2,6

I’m a beginner runner (5’7”, 185 lbs) and currently running at a pace of about 13:24 per mile. I have a supinating gait (underpronation), but I’m considering the Asics Gel-Kayano 30 — even though they’re meant for overpronators.

Wanted recommendations for a new pair as a heavy beginner.,"Hello I'm trying to get back into running so I went over to my local Fleet Feet to get scanned and a new pair of shoes. I measured out at a size 10 and the sales rep brought out 3 pairs of shoes, all size 11.5. I noticed they all had a ton of space in the toe box but was told there should be at least a thumb width at the top. The heel was slipping a bit on all 3 pairs and he laced these Clifton 10s (Wide) tight and it seemed to be the best of the 3. I asked if I should go down to a size 11 and he said with my other measurements, they would be tight on my feet.

I went on a brisk walk/jog with them and they kept slipping on my heels even when the laces were pretty tight. I'm definitely going to return them but now I don't know what shoe to get and in what size.

I think he sized me up this much because my some of my measurements were on the big side (I'm also a pretty hefty guy at 5'10, 255lbs.

1keuqpm,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Novablast 5 are they good for long walks?,"Hello

I don't run but I do (very) long walks, sometimes 8 hours a day when traveling.

So I need good shoes with cushion and softness.

I already have the NB 1080 v14 in black and used them during my last travel, they are pretty good and comfy all day long.

I bought the Hoka Bondi 9 yesterday, they don't have the softness of the 1080 but they are a tad more stable, though I want to return them because after 5 minutes I started to notice a hotspot on my small toe of the left foot, the border of the shoe is a bit pressing on it.

I tried the Nimbus 27 but the tapered toe box was already blocking my toes upward , and after the black toenail I had with the Monster I don't want to get the same scenario .

I tried today the Novablast 5 and was surprised how smooth and soft the midsole was! Really close to a Nimbus or 1080!

I know this might not be the best place to ask but this is where I hope to find some help. I am looking for shoes to buy for long distance walking. I participate in long walking events, usually a few days from 2 to 4. I walk about 30km + each day, sometimes even getting closer to 50km a day. I weight around a 100kg sometimes wear a backpack that weighs less than 10kg. My feet are fairly wide I wear us size 13. I walk in different environments, most commonly I get to walk on asphalt. I was thinking what would better suit me, actual walking/hiking shoes or good running shoes. I have experimented a bit but never found anything that would be really good. This weekend I went on a two day walk around 25km each day. I wore the nike pegasus 40 they were pretty good, just the “foxing” or whatever it is called was rubbing quite a bit on my achilles. I don’t mind spending a bit more on the shoes as long as they are going to be reliable and last. I’m not sure if I need to add anything else.

1kes9y6,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Superblasts/Novablasts/Gel Nimbus for my pace?,"I need advice - I have done my first 10k race, and am now training for a HM in October.
My current pace for a race is 6:50 (slow I know) but I’m hoping that by the time the HM comes around I’ll be faster. And my tempo runs are usually between 5:15 and 6:05.

I’m using a structured (Runna) plan with easy runs, tempos and intervals, hill repeats, and long runs.
I’m female in case this matters for the shoes.  Gait analysis says I should get a neutral shoe. 

Currently I mainly run in Brooks Ghost Max 2, of which I have one pair. 
I very recently added the Saucony Endorphin Speed 4 for tempos and intervals. 

I feel that the Brooks Ghost are a bit slow and more suitable for easy runs? They don’t seem to give me much energy. Now that I’m training longer distances for the HM, would it be worth getting a shoe for my long runs, and only use the Brooks for easy runs? And once I need to replace my Brooks (which will be in about 2 months), should I get a dedicated easy run shoe?

I was looking at the ASICS Superblast for the long runs, but also considering Novablast. 
And I’ve heard that the Gel Nimbus 27 would make a great easy runs shoe to replace my Brooks once the time comes.

1kerhjq,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Need guidance on Brooks shoe selection,"Hello sub - I used to be a seasons runner a decade ago. The Brooks Adrenalines were perfect for my flat feet and the 4e wideness was fantastic. It was amazing. So I recently started 2 months ago and bought a new pair of Adrenaline GTS 24 (I am nostalgic for past iterations of these shoes, I know they change for better or worse every year). I put about 60 miles on them and I got a bout of runners knee (pain on the inside of my right knee). I probably went too hard in the paint, but I was wondering if it was my shoe? I went to Brooks 'find a pair' and went through their assessments and it told me I should be using the Ghost 16, Glycerin 22, Glycerin Max, Ghost Max 2 or Glycerin Stealthfit 22. I was going to lauigh it off as a gimmick but I was taken aback the Adrenalines weren't even suggested. I fall within the 90 day return window. Would it benefit me to try one of the alternatives? Any guidance? Again, I am overweight (working on that), flat footed, and I do roughly 3-4 miles daily. If the runners knee is moreso just to talk it easy for a few weeks and not ramp up so hard, and its not shoe related issue, I'll just keep the shoes. i have no shin splints, no blisters, no foot pain, as is.

1keo2f0,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Shoes that are fast but also stable but also wide,"Hey guys, I'm in desperate need of some recommendations for my next running shoe. Right now I'm using Novablast 5's but unfortunately I overpronate a lot in them, to the point where my ankles hurt for a while after my runs. I think it's partly because of my natural running form which might not even be a problem in other shoes, but also because the Asics don't seem to fit my rather wide feet, as in there's not enough shoe underneath my feet to stop the ankle from slipping/collapsing inwards. So I'm not really sure if I just need actual 2E shoes (that are available in Europe) or stability in general, but I think the squishiness of the Novablasts doesn't help.

I run around 30km per week at a pace of 4:30min/km, sometimes slower sometimes faster. I think I'm somewhere between forefoot and mid foot striker and I rarely do slower recovery runs, I'm aware that this is probably not ideal though haha

So far I've been considering the Glycerin 22 GTS (2E), the NB Rebel v4 (2E) and the Saucony Tempus 2 or maybe even Speed 4, although Sauconys don't seem to be available in 2E where I live (Germany).

1kefwzl,AskRunningShoeGeeks,[Advice Request] Do my wear patterns suggest I can move away from stability shoes?,"Hi all — looking for a bit of guidance!

I’ve been running for about 10 years and was originally told I overpronated, so have mostly worn stability shoes since. My current rotation includes:

– Saucony Tempus (Daily, ~300 miles)
– Hoka Speedgoat 5 (Trails, ~400 miles)
– Saucony Endorphin Speed 3 (for speedwork only)

I’ve recently looked at the outsole wear on both the Tempus and Speedgoats — both show a pattern of outside heel wear, with push-off towards the inside forefoot. From what I’ve read, that sounds more like a neutral pattern?

My question is: could the Tempus wear be influenced by the arch support/stability features, making it look neutral even if I’m not? But then again, I don’t think the Speedgoats have any major stability features, and they show the same wear pattern.

Before I switch to a fully neutral daily trainer, I’d really appreciate any thoughts from folks who’ve made the transition or understand gait mechanics better than I do.

For my next pair, here’s what I’m after:
– Neutral daily trainer that’s lightweight
– Can handle easy miles and tempo work
– Helps me hold momentum on tired legs
– Needs excellent grip in wet conditions (UK based and I run very hilly road routes with some light trail)

Previously, I owned a pair of Brooks Adrenaline GTS 21 and had no issues, so I may just return back to those when I return this current pair giving me issues. I guess it may be worth it visit a foot specialist or something too to maybe get inserts lol! I feel like my walk is all wonky.

1ke7j7f,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Examining running shoe foam profiles on runrepeat,"I recently noticed that some of my favorite running shoes (nike zegama 2 and adidas prime x 2 strung) have a mid-hump in the midsole foam.

This seems to allevite pressure off the forefoot and allow more even distribution when transitioning from heel to toe (by allowing the midfoot to absorb some of the pressure), which allows me to run longer.

Rather than a flat heel like adidas evo sl which ends up feeling quite firm and not as comfortable

1ke71rt,AskRunningShoeGeeks,"Shoe suggestions for max cushion, stability & arch support","I’ll be going on a 6 week trip at the end of the month where I expect to be doing a whole lot of walking (as someone who is pretty inactive) and am trying to find the right pair of shoes for the job.

I’ve gone to a couple specialty stores and have learned the following about what I need: -Support for high arches 
-Max cushion for comfort 
-Stability to correct for a weak right ankle that supinates (I’ve sprained it so many times that it’s hyper mobile) 
-Good lock-in for the heels (not too much width there)

So far the best shoes I have tried are the Saucony Hurricane 24, but my partner thinks they’re hideous and I have to agree. I also found them a bit weird because with the extra-wide base, I could tell the outer corner of my right heel was striking before the rest of my foot thanks to my ankle.

A common issue I find in shoes is that because my right foot doesn’t land totally flat, my heel tends to land on the inner edge of the insole which can be quite uncomfortable. I also often find shoes with a mid-foot band or elastic too tight on the top.

I realize this is pretty specific and I do plan to go get a proper assessment, but I figured maybe you folks would have some suggestions.

One of the places I went actually had a foot scan tool, so a link to those results is below if that’s helpful.

1ke3nrk,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Which Shoe Rotation Pairs For Intervals & Daily Shoes Will Work Better? Nike Zoom Fly 6 & Nike Pegasus Plus OR Nike Pegasus Plus & Asics Novablast 5?,"Hi 

I currently do intervals in Nike Zoom Fly 6's and have a pair of Nike Pegasus Plus as a daily trainer for slower and recovery runs. However, the Pegasus Plus are closer to the ground, less cushioned than the Asics Novablast 5 and I keep reading that they are better at higher speeds and tempo runs. I did try the Pegasus 41 but preferred the lightness of the Pegasus Plus' Flyknit upper and felt the arch a bit constricted with the Pegasus 41 (which probably has better support and cushioning)

I can return the Zoom Fly 6's (still within return period), keep the Pegasus Plus for intervals and get the Novablast 5 for a recovery shoe. Will this combination work better than the current one of the Nike duo?

The Zoom Fly 6's are working well but again are not suited to slower pace running. They are perhaps also less forgiving due to the carbon plate.

I have recently had spine surgery and wish to minimise the impact.

I am currently running in the Gel Nimbus, but they only have have about 50 miles of life left in them. While I like the Gel Nimbus for my slow workouts, I feel like they are not working with me when I push out of my Z2 pace (anything faster than 8:30 mile splits).

I am looking at buying a new pair to be my new trainer, and potentially looking at a dedicated race shoe as I close in to race day. I plan on keeping the Gel Nimbus around until they hit their mileage limit, but only using them for easy recovery runs. I am split between the Superblasts, Novablasts, and Magic Speeds. I have tried looking at reviews, but with my only baseline being the Gel Nimbus, I am having a hard time differentiating the three (especially between the Nova and Superblasts).

My ideal use case is using them for my long runs and fast runs, only going back to the Gel Nimbus for shorter recovery sessions.

• Budget: Any.

• Intended use and distance (speed workouts, walking, long runs, easy runs, races, versatile): Near-daily training: speed, tempo, progression, and long runs. Pace anywhere from high Z2 and upward.

1kdv3cu,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Endorphin Speed 4 for someone with stability needs,"About a year ago, I bought my first pair of running shoes. After a gait analysis at my local running store, I was recommended anti-pronation shoes and went with the Saucony Guide 17. In January, I replaced them with the Saucony Hurricane 24, again based on the store's advice, and also added the Saucony Tempus 2 to my rotation.

Throughout 2024, I struggled with shin splints and various aches, which kept my weekly mileage under 15 km. But this year, things have turned around. I've been focusing on strength work, running only easy paces before adding speed work, and improving my form, cadence etc. As a result, I'm now consistently running 50 km per week without issues—often including 20–24 km long runs on weekends.

I’ve got two half marathons coming up: one in three weeks (just for fun with colleagues—I'll treat it like a semi-fast long run), and another in six weeks where I’m targeting a 1h30m finish.

I was planning to use my Tempus 2 for both, which I’m confident will get the job done. However, I now have the chance to get a pair of Endorphin Speed 4 for €100 and I'm very tempted. I know they’re technically neutral, but I’ve read they offer more inherent stability than most plated shoes and I read different things about using neutral shoes as a pronator. My thought was that since I have a better running form now (compared to when I was sold the Guide&Hurricane) and clock more miles than before, I may be able to handle (stable-)neutral shoes

The EVO SL looks great, I got the one with red stripes with off white. I was expecting pure white but the off white still looks good.

I could feel the energy return and like I was expecting I was running faster than I intended. I think I could easily use this as a 5km speed shoe. Although I got other shoes that can do that job (metaspeed and Takumi).

1kdgiga,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Adidas Evo SL insole?,I just received my pair or evo sl’s and after a few minutes of use I notice my toes feeling an edge of the insole. I take the shoe off and the insole looks to be a 1/2 size short before the end of the toe box. The shoe has that little bit of room and the end of the toe box to create a good fit but right beyond that the insole stops. I’m hoping this is a manufacture mistake and they accidentally put the wrong size insole in. really hope this isn’t by design.

1kdfxtn,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Clifton 10 extra wide (4e) experiences,"Hey guys, so long story short, I have the Clifton 8 wides because I have a wide foot and those worked for me pretty well. Right now, I do have some foot issues that require me to have a good and high toe box, as well as an overall nicely cushioned shoe, so naturally I'm looking at Clifton 10s.

My question is, does anybody have experience in buying the new extra-wide (4E) version? This is the first time Hoka Cliftons come in extra wide, only the Bondi came in 4E.

I don't have this option to buy it in my country, I need to ship it abroad, so that's why I'm asking here. Any thoughts would be valuable, because there are really conflicting comments and reviews online, some saying that the toe box is much roomier and others saying that the toe box is narrower or steeper. I know this is the case pretty much with every shoe, because the fit can be confusing, but I want to hear from your guys' perspective because Cliftons are my ""safe"" shoes, at least 8s",2025-05-03 00:13:39+00:00,1,1

1kdc7f7,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Having An Existential Crisis,"So, as the title suggests, I am currently having a mini crisis over you guessed it: shoes. 

I previously posted about trying to find a shoe for everyday use. Mainly kicking around from place to place, grocery shopping etc. I very well may also use it as an easy day/recovery day shoe as that’s really all that’s missing in my rotation currently. 

So I popped into my local running store to try out the Nimbus 27 and the Glycerin Max. 
For reference, I am roughly 5’11 and 195lbs. 

I love the upper on the Nimbus 27 so much. That sock like fit is just **chefs kiss**. Something about the padding on the heel felt a little off but I think it quickly went away. As far as the midsole goes, it felt plush with a touch of bounce and responsiveness. I enjoyed it but it was a lot softer than what I’m used to with Lightstrike pro. 

Then I tossed on the Glycerin Max’s. As far as upper goes, I wasn’t ’wowed’ by any stretch of the imagination. It’s decent but no Nimbus 27, lemme tell ya. However, that midsole. OH MY LORDY LORD. It’s just… wonderful? It’s somehow soft while still being so bouncy and responsive for how big of a shoe it is. It’s also a little lighter than the Nimbus which I appreciate. 

So between the two, it was pretty obvious to me that although I do strongly enjoy the Nimbus, I’d be much happier in the Glycerin Max, simply due to how they feel and ride underfoot. 
So here’s my actual issue I’m facing. THEY ARE ABSOLUTE BOATS. I don’t know how ASICS managed to hide their stack height in the Nimbus so much better. I don’t even know if that makes sense. I’m sure it has a lot to do with the heel toe drop in the Glycerin Max only being 6mm but wow, do you ever feel like you’re just… floating? Even the guys inside the shop started joking around with me after I said “I feel like I’m trying to compensate for something. Is this the equivalent of a lifted truck for shoes”? They also know that I’ll be using them for mostly daily use and running around and partially agreed it may be a little silly depending. 

So here’s the question. Do I care? Should I care? Is my insecurity here reasonable and everyone is going to look at me and say “what in the 1989 Moonshoes am I looking at”. Should I just go with the Nimbus 27 for the simple fact that I won’t look like I’m ready to go for a casual jog across the lake on my buoys? I need advice. ",2025-05-02 21:21:04+00:00,0,17

I never ran in Nike shoes and I don't know hot would they translate going from my other pairs. 

In regular sneakers I usually go from size 42 2/3 to 43 1/3 depending on the model. But in running shoes since the upper is stretchier I have more room to wiggle. For example in my Adidas I can get away with both 42 2/3 and 43 1/3 and for my Saucony shoes my Kinvara are 42,5 but they feel the same as my Triumph RFG that are 43. And I have a pair of Novablast 3 at 43.5 that once again feels very good.

1kczb1w,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Long-time Adrenaline GTS wearer looking for recommendations for a new daily trainer,"I've been wearing the Adrenaline GTS since 2019. In high school I was ""diagnosed"" as an overpronator and thrown into maximal stability shoes and just stuck with those ever since. I'm aware now that gait analysis used in running shoe stores is basically pseudoscience and it has got me thinking about trying different kinds of shoes for my next daily trainer.

I've been using the Adrenaline GTS 23 for the last 2 years. I've gone through at least 4 or 5 pairs at this point and I've never had any issues with them. I do also own a pair of Saucony Endorphin Speeds which I use for shorter races, track workouts, and LT intervals. I really love getting the chance to put those on because they just feel so much faster and lighter than the Adrenalines, but I do find them lacking in ankle support when making sharper turns.

I was considering a lot of different options when shopping for new trainers. I wanted to go for a more ""neutral stability"" shoe and was considering the Saucony Tempus, but my local running shoe store didn't have them in stock and suggested the Saucony Hurricane 24 as an alternative. While I did find them very comfortable as they have a lot more cushion than I am used to, they did seem way heavier than the Adrenaline GTS. I decided to buy them to give them a try this weekend, but found out when I got home that the Hurricane is in no way an alternative to the Tempus as it is their maximal stability/cushion shoe vs. the Tempus which is more neutral. I did a short recovery run in them this morning and found them very comfortable, but I am not sure if they are exactly what I was looking for in a new trainer.

My general needs are basically just a daily trainer that would be good for easy/recovery runs, long runs, and tempo runs. I am running 35-45mpw currently. For shorter intervals and races, I am definitely comfortable sticking with the Endorphin Speeds. I am a bit hesitant to go for something too different to the Adrenaline GTS because it's a shoe I am in the middle of an 8K training cycle and don't want to introduce something so unfamiliar that I risk injuring myself because of it. Is there one shoe that would be a good fit here? Or should I just play it safe and stick with the Adrenaline GTS for now?",2025-05-02 12:06:46+00:00,2,5

1kchdc7,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Long run trainer ideas and rotation before marathon,"Male, 43 years, 68 kg.

Running my first marathon late sept and right now around 170-190 km a month. Primarily zone 2 but also some tempo and progression.

I have had 575 km in Novablast 5 which - to my surprise - already feels dead. I got the Adidas Evo SL a month ago and really love it.

I could use some input for adding 1-2 pair to a decent rotation before the race.

**For long runs at 20-30 km** I am right now running at 5:00-5:30 pace/km  
Looking at a mileage training shoe or a bit faster trainer that can do a lot om km in a decent speed. Should I go a faster trainer AND a recovery, or can I use the same for long runs from 15 to 30 km from 4:30 til 5:45 pace?

I have been looking at:  
Nike Vomero 18  
Saucony Triump 22 (maybe wait for the 23?)  
HOKA Bondi 9 (too soft maybe)  
Brooks Glycerin max (too soft maybe)  
Superblast 2 (maybe more for tempo)

**For 5-15 tempo and interval**  
5K at 20 min  
10K at 43 min

My current Adidas Evo SL  
Maybe after that or for longer runs Saucony Endorphin Pro 4, Superblast 2

I've never really thought about what kind of running shoes i've been using so I have no kind of experience on the subject really. I really like the ds trainers though and i'm a bit scared to radically change shoes after such a long time of using them.
I used them in everything from shorter interval runs to half marathons. Currently trying to train for a marathon in the summer.

I was planning on using my EVO for all speed workouts short and long, so I was hoping to find a recovery shoe that can also handle both shorter and long runs.

I’m an over-pronator. I started in old Fresh Foam Vongo V4s, and more recently I’ve been rotating the Kayano 30s and Nike Infinity RN4s. I’m considering adding the Saucony Tempus and one other pair to round out the rotation—ideally something a bit more responsive.

Lately, I’ve been dealing with recurring shin splints, especially after back-to-back 10k+ days. I’ve been doing strength and dorsiflexion work, but the issue is still limiting.

I’ve seen recommendations for the ForeverRun Nitro 1 as a soft, stable option that helps with shin splints. But now the Nitro 2 is out, and reviews are few and far between. Has anyone here run in both and can compare? Is the 2 similarly (or more) helpful, or should I opt for the original?

Vaporfly sizing is weird for me. I have experience with all versions of VF but they were all in different sizes.

\- I got a pair of VF1 in US12. It was pretty roomy and I felt like I could go down a size to get a better lockdown. 

\- Then, I got a pair of VF2 in US11.5. It had a spike upper feeling which I liked. However, I would lace on a spike whenever I was racing on the track. The VF2 on long workouts (and even a 5k track race) felt boring underfoot but made me go fast. However, the base of my foot was burning throughout the race. 

\- Then, I got a pair of VF3 in US11.5. The upper was a lot more airy and it felt a lot more comfortable. I raced HMs in them with no issues of hotspots in my soles. I liked the shoe but it didn't have the good lockdown feeling that I had in the VF2.

  
For some other information, I like the fitting for US11.5 in most shoes like Nike Pegasus 40, Nike Structure 25, Asics Novablast 3, Adidas Evo SL. I'm so confused as to which size to purchase. Admittedly, most of these shoes are trainers or speed workout shoes. When doing speedwork, I find that US12 shoes become roomy and made my foot slip (causing friction and hotspots). 

I'll probably get both sizes to figure out the sizing but imo without running, I would not know what sizing really fits me. If anybody has the same issue as me and have a pair of VF4, please help me out. Thanks a lot.",2025-05-01 10:22:17+00:00,2,2

I'm trying out the MSP in size 10 and during track workouts I find that my foot is feeling like it's slipping outside of the shoe print (L foot- anterior lateral by the pinky toe feels like I am jutting out beyond where the bottom shoe is). I'm guessing this is because the mesh is super loose and doesn't hold my foot ""in"" the shoe. The bottom of my 3rd/4th/5th toes feel like they are desperately grabbing onto the bottom outside edge of the shoe mold, like I'm dangling on the edge of a pool with my toes about to fall into the pool type of feeling.

I tried 9.5 and remember it feeling tight, and for some reason feel this is not quite a size issue as issue with the upper mesh just not locking the foot in?

Anyone else with this issue? I'd love to love the MSP... also the foot arch feels super high... and the foam doesn't snap as much as I was expecting.

The sole actually handled steep technical downhill better than I expected however during a couple of long steep descents the insole in my left foot slipped forward and bunched at the toe. I've never had this happen in any of my other shoes and was just wondering if anyone has a similar issue with them or if I just got a faulty pair. 

I contacted Nike who wouldn't confirm or deny if this was a known issue and told me to contact the shop I bought them from. 

P.s they're shocking on downhill marsh, but with small lugs this wasn't unexpected. ",2025-04-30 17:37:48+00:00,2,7

1kblika,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Novablast 5 size question,"I wonder if I should have bought a larger size of Asics Novablast 5.

My feet are 257 mm long, which converted to EU size is 40,8 if I am not totally wrong. I looked up Asics size charts which placed my foot (26 cm) into size 41,5 (UK 7).

So I received my shoes and went for a run yesterday. I noticed my big toe was hitting something, but I didnt get any marks or noticed any pain. My third toe counting from the big toe had a little scratch (loose skin), but I dont know if that was shoe-related.

Anyway, when I ordered my shoe, I didnt add any extra room - which I now think I should have?

AI is recommending me to add 10 - 15 mm extra. So that means a size of EU 42 or 42,5 (UK 7,5 or UK 8).

I dont have any nearby shops to try other sizes of Novablast. I don't think I can return these either since I used them outdoors. But I am considering selling them and buying new ones if my sizes are wrong.

There is however a shop with some other Asics shoe (Trabuci Max 4, Gel kayano and so on). I can go try out them if thats comparable.

I also bought Adidas Evo SL with a size of 41 1/3 (UK 7,5) and VJ Ultra 3 (UK 7). I have received the Evo shoes, and they fit just as Novablast. Worried they also might be too tight. I have not gone outdoors with them yet.

Any help is appreciated!

1kbdgn2,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Shoe Durability Question,"
Hi All,

I know there have been lots of questions around durability and life of specific models of shoes, but my question is more broad based around what you all are seeing for average shoe life and if it can vary a lot from person to person? 

I have been running consistently for about a year now. I am a bit heavier runner at 6’0 and 190 lbs. My HM pace is 8:30 and my easy pace is anywhere from 9:45-11:00/mi. I tend to heel strike and pronate inward based on the tread wear of my shoes. Cadence is average 160-165 for most runs. 

My question is around shoe durability as I seem to be tearing through them quickly. I had to retire a pair of Rebel V4s at 150 miles for being dead and hurting my feet, a pair of SC Elite v4s at just over 100 miles ( I did do 2 Hyrox and 2 HMs in them), and now my 1080 v14s have appeared to have gone flat as of this week after 180 miles. The rocker and any energy return seems to have vanished and my feet hurt after my last two easy runs in them. 

New Balance shoes tend to fit my wider feet and I appreciate their rocker and uppers and overall aesthetic. Have really enjoyed the way that the midsoles have felt as well right up until they died. Outsole appears to be in good shape at time of death as well. 

Other shoe/ in my rotation are the Saucony EP4 which is holding strong at about 95 miles, and then some other shoes below the 70 mile mark (Balos, Endorphin Speed 4)

TLDR; My question is, is it possible to be chewing through shoes that quickly or is it all in my head as maybe the shoes are a bit more broken in and just not as exciting to run in as earlier in their life? If they are indeed going dead, what shoes should I look at that might have a combination of comfortable/bouncy but durable foam? ",2025-04-30 10:50:13+00:00,1,1

I just bought the New Balance 1080 v14 at a New Balance outlet in Bangalore. It cost me Rs. 17,999 (USD 212). This is 22% higher than the retail cost at US which is USD 165.

1kb5jk1,AskRunningShoeGeeks,[Help me pick] Heavy-ish Runner,"Daily trainer for a heavier runner (~225lbs) doing 50km/week

Hey fellow shoe geeks,

I’m 6’4” and around 225lbs (dropping slowly, but I’ll likely always hover above 205). I’d say I’m pretty fast for my size, my easy Zone 2 runs sit around 4:45–5:00/km, and I dial it back to around 5:30-5:45/km for longer Zone 1 recovery runs.

I’m running about 50km/week while training for a couple of middle-distance triathlons, then moving into a marathon training block.

I’m on the hunt for a new daily mile-eater. My Saucony Ride 17s have been awesome but are cooked after ~450km. I’ve got race-day shoes covered, and I occasionally used them for tempo sessions too.

Shoes I’ve tried on and liked: •	Novablast – feels great, fun ride •	Superblast – also great, slightly firmer, and I figure with my mileage it might hold up better and not bottom out as fast

Any other gems I should be looking at? I’m not tied to any brand.

Worth noting: my body handles running pretty well overall, no major issues other than some tight calves (probably because my current dailies are well past their prime).

Recovery / General: Rebel v3, v4, Novablast 5  
Speed/Tempo: Boston 12  
Long Run / MP: Superblast 2, AP3, EP3  
Race: MSP

Mach 6: I've always really enjoyed lightweight trainers for recovery / moderate runs, loved the Novablast 5, Rebel v3, but at 400+ miles in each of my current pairs I need something new. I have a Rebel v4 in the mail, and while they're pretty much identical niches I like alternating the Novablast/Rebel v3 for recovery / doubles so they would fit right in. Definitely the most surefire bet.

Skyward X: I haven't tried these, but they're definitely the most unique shoe Hoka seems to have and most people seem to love them. They're more expensive than the Mach 6 but I have nothing else like it in my current lineup. I'd mostly be using these for recovery / moderate runs, is that a good use or a waste?

Other options: Bondi seems boring compared the Skyward, Clifton isn't bad but I'm quite sure I'd prefer the Mach 6, Skyflow was another option I was looking at but they don't seem to last long.

1kavvtt,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Need advice on replacing my Brooks Adrenaline GTS 21 — time to switch?,"Hi all,

I’ve been running with my Brooks Adrenaline GTS 21 for over 600 km, and I think it might be time to replace them. They’ve been great — very comfortable, no pain or injuries — but I’m not sure how to tell if it’s really time. Any signs I should be looking for besides mileage?

When I bought them, I was around 20 kg heavier and had a gait analysis done that showed I was a mild overpronator. That’s why I went for the Adrenaline. But now that I’ve lost weight, I’m wondering if my gait has changed — should I do another gait analysis before buying a new pair?

Also, while I’ve loved the comfort of these shoes, I’m curious about trying something a bit more responsive and less cushioned — something that still offers some support, but maybe a bit more fun to run in. Open to suggestions.

My current running habits:
	•	20–30 km per week, mostly easy runs in heart zones 2–3
	•	Pace: 5:00–6:00 min/km
	•	I occasionally do 10–21k races, no marathons
	•	80% of my runs are on pavement

Any shoe recommendations for someone in this transition phase? Should I stick with stability shoes, or is it safe to try a neutral option? Really appreciate any insights!

Thanks!

1kavpgc,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Deviate Nitro 3 vs Novablast 5 as a daily/long run shoe,"Currently using Endorphin Pro 2 for workouts/races, and looking for a daily shoe for easy and long runs (some with HM pace segments as I’m currently training for a HM in June). I’ve used Invincible 3 that I liked for easy runs and Pegasus 40 which I found too boring. I’m around 77kg and mildly overpronate.

Leaning toward Deviate Nitro 3 more than Novablast 5, both around the same price. I’ve heard Novablast is fun but unstable and I’ve read about some durability issues for heavier runners after 150km. Deviate has a carbon plate, although not as aggressive as race shoes, but is it still good for easy runs around 6-6:30/km pace? Any thoughts on ride feel, durability, and versatility?

So as the title mentions, I’m looking for a new race day shoe. I currently run in the Saucony Endorphin Elite v1 and they’ve been incredible to me. Just curious if others have recommendations. I’ve tried on others such as AF3, VF3, On Cloudboom strike, endorphin elite 2 etc but none of them never really caught my eye. The only two so far that I’ve considered are the adios pro 4 and the metaspeed edge Paris. With the pro 4, I feel it may be too soft for my liking though. I enjoy running in shoes where I can still feel the ground per se. I honestly liked the rolling feeling with the edge Paris and how light it is so I may lean towards that. If it helps, I am a heel striker and my other shoes I run in are Evo SL, Speed 3/4, Novablast 4/5. Just want to know if there are others I should try out before I perhaps go with the edge Paris.

1kajbsu,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Half marathon T minus 12 days - shoe help please,"Hi all! 

Hope you can help me please. 

For context, I’m 39f, 56kg, size uk4 and I have recently gotten back into running in the last year or so. I am on my third pair of Reebok Floatride Energy 2s (~200kms+) which I tend to run shorter easy runs in, although I mostly prefer trail running, for which I wear a pair of Brooks Divides (~400km). 
I have run a couple of 10k races in the last 6 months, the last one a PB of 50:12 (in the Brooks). 

I am running a half marathon on road in 12 days(!) and was very keen to get a PB (previous PB 1:48 many moons ago). Naively/ignorantly I hadn’t really been thinking about my shoe choice until I ran a 20km last week in my Brooks trail shoes, mostly on road, and the unsuitability/lack of cushion was very apparent in the last 5/6km. (And my thighs and calves were humming/jarring for a few days after!)

I’ve spent the last week or so trying to source a shoe to finish training in, and race in; I’ve tried a mix of everyday trainers, long run recommended, bouncy ones, and a couple of carbon plate ones, all of which I have discounted either because I didn’t like the shoe or my size wasn’t available. I’ve got (probably) a last ditch attempt with some ASICS today (cumulus 25, 26, Novablast 4; I also bought a pair of novablast 5 which I’ve tried on but I’m not sure about, as I’m not used to that much bounce!), although I could still get to the shops if needed! 

I’ve been lurking here a little while soaking up lots of knowledge and wondered if I could ask your advice - should I carry on trying to find a new shoe, or is it a bit late now, and should I wear the Floatride Energy for the half?

TL;DR should I wear my Floatride Energy 2s for a half marathon in 12 days or try a new shoe?

I am a new runner and recently started running longer distances, over ten miles. I have been wearing the Nike Pegasus 41s. However, now that I am running longer distance I picked up a pair of Nike Vomero 18's. I can already tell they have a lot more cushion and bounce to them. For reference, I also went to the local running store and they recommended the Vomero 18's. They did not do a huge analysis, though. All they did was watch me walk and told me I am a ""neutral"" runner. 

However, on my first run (it was an interval workout) I noticed my calf started hurting. I know many people have a shoe rotation and now that I am starting to take running more seriously, I had the following two questions:  
  
(1) Should I use the Peg 41's for my tempo/intervals runs that are under \~5 miles or so? 

(2) Is it common to have some aches when switching shoes and running in them for the first time? 

With the Peg 41's I would get pretty bad pain in my feet \*after\* the run, and during the run my shins would hurt sometimes. That's what really prompted the switch in the first place now that I am increasing my mileage. Any tips would be appreciated here. Thanks!

I’m at a point where I’ve spent way too much money on running shoes without finding the perfect racing one and I was wondering if anybody has a recommendation for a unicorn shoe that fulfills these requirements, in order of priority:

*Non-plated
*Cushioned but flexible sole
*Not too high heel to toe drop, ideally max 6mm but will consider up to 8mm
*Not too narrow toe box but average width is fine (to be clear narrow midfoot and heel is fine).
*Lightweight and nimble enough for a race
*Works for a lighter runner: 5’6, 135lbs
*Works for slower runner at 8-8.30min/mile race pace 

Shoes I’ve tried:
Superblast 2 - love them for long slow runs but too clunky for racing 
EVO SL - hated the tongue, returned them
Topo specter 2 and cyclone 2 - the soles were amazing in both but toe box is too wide and gave me blisters even with injinji socks 
Puma Liberate - love for short speed workouts but not cushioned enough for HM
NB Rebel v4 - closest match but the tongue is a little too short and they’re not super fun to run in 

Most plated shoes, just don’t work for me due to a foot issue I have (tried Mizuno Neo vista, Saucony endorphin pro 3, puma deviate nitro elite, hoka Mach x2, and many more).",2025-04-28 19:05:41+00:00,3,25

1ka2e5j,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Shoe recommendations - balls of feet burning,"I really would like to run a marathon, but I get excruciating burning pain under the balls of my feet which I can't tolerate, when I go past 10K. I've completed a few halfs, but the last half was always very uncomfortable.

I have tried a few shoes, Asics cause burning almost immediately. Brooks Ghost have been best, preventing it until after 10K. I tried an NB Fresh Foam X 1080, that was worse than the Brooks Ghost but better than Asics.

I read that cushioned shoes may make burning worse, but everything seems to be cushioned to the max these days. I was wondering if someone could recommend something?

I train on trail paths due to where I live, but races are on the road. I was thinking about trying the Brooks Catamount Agil for training (I like Brooks return policy, I can't afford to try endless shoes that I can't return once worn). But would love some tips, advice, words of wisdom that anyone may have.

I have been using Puma running shoes for some time, and I'm happy with them. Mostly Velocity Nitro 3 for daily runs and Magnify Nitro 2 for long runs. 

I'm looking for racing shoes but it seems Puma has a few options in their portfolio. I will be using these shoes mostly for Half Marathons and 10K races (specifically the former), and perhaps very occasionally for some 5K races. The full marathon is an option, but certainly not for this year. 

* Puma Fast-R 2 Nitro Elite - may be an overkill? (not sure about the new 3 as it's been sold out immediately so I didn't include it in the list)
* Fast-FWD Nitro Elite - not sure if they're good for Half Marathons? 
* Puma Deviate Nitro Elite 3 - seems the most universal one, but the colours in men's shoes are so weird. 
* Puma Deviate Nitro 3 - the most basic one, but maybe could do the job?

1k9zeqq,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Looking for a replacement for my Novablast 3,"Hello everyone, a bit of context for me as a runner. I started running 3 years ago when I weighed 108 kg as a 175cm tall man. In the first year or so I lost 15kg and worked my way up to about 20km a week in volume. For that period I ran in some old handball shoes I had and started having pains in my ankles and knees that would not go away between runs and persisted for 2 months until I was recommended the Novablast 3.

I got a pair and the pains went way instantly and I lost another 5kg going down to 88 in August of last year. Then I kinda skipped runs from August till December due to various reasons and I am back up at 95kg.

In January I started being serious again and ran an average of 80-90km a week for the past four months. However, I think the fact that I gained some weight back and the Novablast going on their second year, the pain in my left ankle and my right knee started to show up again, and sometimes my hip also hurts towards the end of a run.

Overall I liked the Novablast but the fabric tore pretty easily around the big toe on my left foot so I was thinking of getting another brand.

The main things I look for are cushioning, toe box durability, a bit of a wider shoes as I have some flat feet and my right foot is wider than my left so it usually starts hurting in tight shoes. I would also like for the shoes to not be slippering on dust or wet surfaces. I run on the road for 90% of the time but there are some portions of my route that are gravel.

I don't really care about speed or other such things as my main reason for running is just burning calories. Before my break in August I would run 5-7km a day at a 5:15 pace, after my break since January I am around a 5:50 pace trying to get back to 5:15 but the aforementioned pains are kinda hindering me.

My budget is around 100 euros +/- 15-20 euros, from what I could gather I was looking at **Adidas Ultraboost Light SS 2023** for 105 euros, based on reviews they seems nice but I see that the sub [r/RunningShoeGeeks](https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/) kinda hates the shoes.

1k9y8yu,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Shoes for first cross country race,"Hi, all.  I’ve been doing road races for about twenty years and would describe myself as having an intermediate skill level - think half marathons in the 92 to 98 minute range. I’ve done the occasional, short trail race. 

It’s come to my attention that there is a local venue that puts on a number of cross country races every year, including one in about a month.  The terrain is hilly and grassy.  It sounds like the ideal shoe would be a longer  cross country spike, but I’m not going to go out and get spikes before I’ve run my first CC race.

1k9y7tv,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Trail Shoes for Tricky Feet,"Hi all - I am a trail runner and have been for a number of years. I continually struggle to find shoes that work for me.

I have a high volume forefoot and a low volume heel. I find myself gravitating to a wide shoes for the added toe box size.

The real challenge, however, is the arch on my right foot. It seems that most of the shoes I try the arch hits too far back on my foot and causes pretty significant discomfort in the arch and then eventually up the post tib an FHL tendons.

As a point of interest, I had a blood clot in the arch of my right foot about 6 years ago while using a prescribed orthotic. I wonder if there is a lingering component there that has made it a really sensitive area.

Shoes I have had success with:

* Hoka Speedgoat v5/6, 10.5 Wide
* NB Hierro v8, 11
* Scarpa SpinPlanet, 44.5
* NB 880 v15, 11
* On CloudMonster, 11
* Topo MTN Racer 1, 112

Recent shoes that haven't worked for me:

* Topo MTN Racer 2+
* Topo Ultraventure 4
* Altra Experience Wild

Interestingly, if I size the shoes down the arch seems to hit closer to the correct location but then my toe box suffers.

1k9u5op,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Nike Streakfly 2 width - how tight should they feel?,"Hello, 

I am wondering if anyone could offer me some advice on the sizing of the new Nike Streakfly 2? I've taken delivery of 2 pairs, one in UK10.5 and the other in UK11. For context, in the previous Streakfly, Nike Dragonfly 1, and Adidas Takumi Sen 8, I wear UK10.5. In most other shoes, such as Vomero 17, Puma Velocity Nitro 3, Saucony Endorphin Speed 3, I wear UK11. The primary reason for the larger size is the shoes feeling a little tight across the foot.  
  
I have bought these Streakfly 2 for racing but also probably 1 workout a week. The UK10.5 fit well length wise, with just a small gap in front of the large toe. However, they feel a little tight across the shoe, and I can feel my pinky toe being squeezed. It's not painful, but it definitely doesn't allow me to spread my toes naturally. The UK11 provides a bit more width, but obviously the length increases too.

My question relates to what is more important? Being able to spread your toes out in a natural way, or matching the length of the shoes to the length of your foot as closely as possible? It should be noted that one of my feet is slightly bigger/smaller than the other.

Have them in my cart to order and of course it’s ultimately up to me what feels good on feet.

1k9afne,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Advice on second shoe with Mach 6,"Reposting this now that I've submitted an acknowledgement of reading the rules.  I don't think that this question is covered by the general buying guidelines in the FAQ and I've seen similar posts, but I am new to the community so apologies if I'm missing something.

For some background:

For years I've had periods where I ran \~15 mpw, but I never really thought about form, shoes, or mileage, and basically tried to pb on every run. Unsurprisingly, I often had minor injuries and would lose motivation, and in 2024 I barely ran at all. This March I decided to learn more and prioritize running, and now I've been slowly working up my mileage with 2 short runs, 2 medium runs, and 1 long run per week. Last week I ran 24 total with a 9 mile long run and I'm hoping to get comfortable running 25-30 mpw throughout May.

I quickly realized that running in the sneakers that I've been walking/exercising/everything in for 4+ years might not be good for my legs, and I bought a pair of Hoka Mach 6 after hearing good things and trying on a few shoes at the store. I've loved running in them, but honestly I think any new shoe would have been an upgrade. I want to try something a bit different to learn more about my own preferences (and because I've heard it may be good both to vary the impact on my feet/legs and to let the foam rest on the Hokas).

* I want to try plated shoes eventually, but I want to wait until I'm thinking about entering a race or at least running for a pb
* I don't want a toe box any more narrow than on the Mach 6
* I mostly run on roads/in parks, but occasionally am on the treadmill and rarely on trails
* I am actively working on my form and especially my cadence which used to be very slow.  Now when I focus, I count around 165-170, but it does drop as I get tired
* I think I have a midfoot strike and no pronation concerns
* I feel more limited by what my legs can handle than by my cardio conditioning so I want impact protection, but I like that my current shoes aren't heavy and I weigh \~140lb so I think I'd be okay training on shoes without maximum foam
* I want a shoe that feels different from the Mach 6, maybe via a more moderate drop or lower heel stack in general, and maybe something positioned as more of hybrid tempo/trainer to use for some of my short/medium runs

I've been looking at the Topo Cyclone 2/3 and Asics Noosa Tri 16 and I like the notion of a shoe with more ""ground feel,"" but I can't tell if these would be good trainer options. I've also considered the FuelCell Rebel v4 and the Adizero EVO SL, which I believe are more similar to the Hokas I have, but seem to be widely popular.

I'd appreciate any advice on these or other shoes! I'm new to the sub and the hobby so hopefully I've given the right information.

1k8vuta,AskRunningShoeGeeks,"Upgrading from More V4 (faster, more responsive)","I basically only run in Fresh Foam More V4. I typically run 42km - 70km races.

I tried Novablast 4, but they gave me the worst heel blisters I've ever experienced after a 30km run.

I used to run in Reebok Floatride Energy X, but they caused a bit of ankle and knee pain.

So I keep going back to the Fresh Foam More V4.

But they're not perfect. My left foot overpronates a lot, so I'd like something more supportive, particularly arch support.

They're very heavy, so I'd like something faster, more responsive and raceday ready.

So can anyone recommend a shoe like Fresh Foam More V4: very cushioned, similar drop, good heel lockdown etc.

- lightweight 
- fast/responsive
- supportive + arch support
- good for both daily training and raceday

1k8roe7,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Help! Can’t find shoes!!,"Hello! I am having the worst time looking for a running shoe that works for me. Before you send me to a running specialty shoe store…. I’ve been… twice.

Years ago I loved running. I had some Nike and eventually Dia Doras. Between starting a family, multiple pregnancies and going back to school, I stopped running. I carry some extra weight now on my 5’5 frame and even running 3-4 times a week hasn’t helped that. Anyways, I recently started running again with a 5k in mind in June. I started running in the ROAV V1 New Balance slip ons just because it’s what I had at the time.

I noticed some slight shin pain. After a month. It wasn’t bad but I started looking at how I run and what shoes might help me. For context I currently run mostly on a treadmill. I jog/run/walk 1.5-3 miles as I’m getting used to it again.

I picked up a pair of the Brooks glycerin 22 after a walk/stand test on one of those machines at a specialty shoe store. At first I felt like my foot was swimming in it and my toes moved too much. I gave it a solid chance but anytime I started running, horrible shin pain that ached and shot up into my thighs. It lasted even after I stopped running which caused me to take a longer break from running than I wanted. I returned for a smaller size because I felt like my foot moved too much in the shoe. Same pain. Returned them. Did some running back in my new balances with way less pain.

Went to a different specialty shop and did a run test on a tread. Based on what he saw he thought I would benefit from support and cushion. I left with some Saucony glide 18s. Tested them out on the tread. They felt ok. Ran some at home… a dull ache in the shins but it resolved some time after.

I guess I’m asking to see if anybody else has also not benefited from a nice running shoe and instead just got so used to running in one type that it was hard to switch? Should I walk more in them first and get my feet/legs used to them? Stretching those muscles is helping the shin pain. I just really don’t want to go backward and lose momentum with training. I want to find a shoe that is healthy for my feet and good for my body.

Any tips and tricks would be great or recommendations of shoes. I appreciate it all!",2025-04-27 00:44:40+00:00,1,3
1k8rnkq,AskRunningShoeGeeks,So… Let’s Talk Comfiest,"So, although I know that preferences will be completely subject to personal bias, I’m wondering what people’s opinions are on the comfiest casual wear shoes.

190-200lbs, 5’11 for reference 

I think I’m almost completely sold on the Nimbus. Only issue being I’ve heard the 26 runs pretty narrow even in 2E and I’m a 2E myself. Also heard it can almost be too soft? The 27 unfortunately isn’t on sale and I’m not very knowledgeable on the 25 at this point. 

I know New balance 1080 is also an option and if someone’s got some solid reasoning on why it would be prefered over the Nimbus, I’d be happy to hear. Also completely happy to listen to literally any other shoe opinion; minding you give a bit of reasoning behind it.

So far, the ones that work best are NB Rebel v3 (though my feet get sore from the softness on runs over 10 miles), inov8 road claw (though I roll onto the medial edge a bit and the stack is too low for long runs on the road, inov8 Trailfly for trails (roll onto narrow midfoot medial wall but at faster pace don’t notice too much, ghost v 11 (haven’t liked many since and it didn’t feel like 12 mm drop for some reason), NB880 v9 and earlier, and Brooks Hyperion 2.

My issues are: incredible hyper-mobility in both feet meaning that severe supportive aspects hurt a lot. I do better with flexible shoes. That said, I pronate too aggressively midstance. Haglund’s so aggressive heal counters are out. Fairly low volume feet especially the right, so many shoes rub under the malleolus if they are cut high.  Really don’t like high stack shoes. I want to feel the ground a bit for stability.

Ideally I’d have a shoe with less than 8 mm drop but more than 4. (Forefoot/midfoot striker but with mildly limited dorsiflexion), flexible or no heel counter, wide forefoot to accommodate my splay foot and mild bunion, mid stack height (Less than 30 or so), pretty flexible.

Hope someone with more experience with a variety of shoes could  help. 

Main question is at the bottom if you want to skip :)

I recently purchased a pair of Adidas boston 12's as I had seen some very good reviews on YouTube for them. 
The first time I wore them I got terrible shin splint type pain from a 2km run. 
For  context 2 days later I ran a half marathon in a pair of Hoka Mach X which gave no pains whatsoever (also managed a PB :) 

I also have in my rotation Inov8 roadfly, on cloudsurfer, scarpa ribelle run, hoka tecton x, pegasus trail 5, all of which give no pains.

I read that the laces on the boston 12'S can cause lockdown issues so purchased some different laces to perform a proper racers knot. I've been out for 2 more runs in the bostons which did cause some pain, but not quite to the same extent. 

My main question is, do I persevere with the bostons with the view that my muscles/tendons etc are adapting to a new stimulus, or do I move on from these and realise they're just not a shoe that suits me? 

I was also looking at getting a pair of adios pro 3s as my training schedule is starting to pick up with a view to doing more races,  but I'm worried I'll have the same reaction to them as I have the bostons 🤷‍♂️

Intervals/Tempo/Long run : Nike Zoom Tempo Next%

Daily : Novablast 3

Trail : Salomon Slab Genesis / Merrell mtl long sky 2

As you saw in my description, I'm a runner that is more on the light side and I realized that I maybe don't really need a mid-to-high stack shoes like the ones I use because they last me a lot longer than it would for a regular person. For exemple, my Novablast 3 lasted 2000km (during the last 200km they felt pretty flat but it wasn't really a problem) and the outsole is almost like brand new.

So I thought maybe I don't need a shoes that have a stack this high and a shoes this heavy (yes it's not a high stack and heavy shoes but there are definitely some lighter options). Those other options won't maybe last long for a runner that is more on the heavy side but for me it would probably last around 800 to 100km which is the average distance you get in a daily trainer before the foam die.

I have considered 2 options for the moment : The Adizero adios 9 and the New balance Rebel V4.

I think the adios 9 would be a great daily trainer for someone that is light like me because they are really lighter than a Novablast. Same for the Rebel V4 even if they aren't as light. My question is mainly about the outsole and midsole durability as they are not really meant for daily use (especially the adios 9).

What do you think and do you have any recommendation of a light shoes that could do most of my daily distances at easy pace that would be lighter than 200g (if it's more I think I won't really see the difference between Novablast and those so its kinda useless.

AP3 - have run 5k and 10k races with. Overall I have had a good experience running with, other than the eyelets which I've had to cut one out. Out of the 3, its the most mileage I have in races. Size 10, snug fit. Have started purchasing size 10.5. About half a size on the small side. Unsure how they will perform and whether they will irritate my feet in this longer distance. However very stable and reliable up until now. 

AP4 - its a recent purchase. 2 treadmill runs and 1 on pavement. Mixed feelings about them. One of the treadmill runs they felt amazing. With the pavement run I was really feeling my ankles (a problem I've been dealing with). Not confident I have enough runs with them. Bit of a wild card. Size feels great though. Very soft and bouncy. Feels unstable if/when heelstriking. I heelstrike when fatigued. 

EVO SL - have run a lot of my recent training runs with them leading up to this race. Not cramped like the AP3s, plenty of room in the toebox. Have run a variety of runs with. Not as fast as the AP3 imo. Works well with my midfoot striking. More stable than the AP4 if I'm fatigued. 

Overall, leaning towards the EVO SL based on recent mileage and comfort, however not the most aggressive/fastest. May take a more conservative approach to this race since its my first HM, and the EVO SL may help hold me back and not overcook it.

Budget: Flexible see prices below

HM Pace : 5:20 min/km

Threshold 4:45 min/km

HM: 1:58 5k 23:40 and 10k 50:49

I have just logged 500 + km in my Rebel V4. A shoe I really liked, it felt fast and light and responsie.

I think I have a wide foot since I often get arch pain in narrow shoes. I might have flat feet in that case?

Anyways, I ended up going with the wide 2E New Balance Rebel V4 and used it for my last half marathon and all my runs during training. As I am continuing with the shoe, it has wear and tear and much less spring and cushion than before after 500km +

I have the NB 1080 V14 as a walking shoe for work and I tried a few recovery runs in those but they felt a little TOO ""Marshmellow-y"" and heavy compared to my Rebel V4.

I have a half planned for next month and am looking to move to marathon distance in the Fall. Im not looking to buy 3-4 pairs and probably plan to race in this shoe unless I decide to get a full plated shoe for the marathon (metaspeed sky)

As a next shoe, what should I go for? Obviously the Superblast 2 has been on my list but in South Korea where I live, there is a Korean StockX style website with brand new nevert worn shoes. I have looked at the following shoes with corresponding prices

Fuel Cell Supercomp Trainer v3 - 138 USD

Adidas Evo SL 130 USD

Theres a few things that could be contributing here so my questions below
1. Could the drop from 12mm - 8mm drop have cause the initial injury? Even though it was a good 250 miles before this happened.
2. Could it be that the ASICS have worn down after 300 and that’s causing the current issues? I plan to test that this week with a run in the Zoom flys and maybe even the brooks

I tried out the Adidas B12s for some time now and unfortunately they just didn’t work for me (heel slippage and  missing cushioning). After realizing that, I ordered Adidas SL2s which arrived today, in sizes 12 and 12.5.

In size 12 they basically feel perfect, however I often find my big toe slightly touching the top of the shoe and I feel like I’d like to have a little bit more space for my toes (I really don’t like them touching something, even if it’s not the tip). Although I didn’t perceive any noticeable foot swelling during my (relatively short, since I’m still getting starting) runs, I’m aware that it can and will happen on longer routes, and I’m worried that the size 12s will be to restricting in that case. The size 12.5s also feel good, however noticeably less snug und also a little bit less stable. There’s definitely more room for movement in the heel area (even when using a runners knot) however I’m not sure if I would call it “slipping”. The room for my toes feels perfect though. My feet are relatively narrow and my left foot is slightly larger than my right one.

I’ll be trying for my first sub 3, trained harder than I ever have over the last 4 months.

Usually race in Endorphin Speed 3 - they currently have 200 miles on them.

I’m considering splashing out on the New Balance Elite V4 - my feet are wide so I’m used to carbon plated shoes not being an option, but these fit.

So my question is - would it be worth investing in a fresh pair of NB Elites? Is there likely to be enough of a speed difference between them and my Speed 3’s which have 200 miles on the clock?

Other concerns are that my daily trainers are 6-8mm toe drop (these are 4mm) and I’ve heard they rub people’s heels (thinking surely pre-emptive plasters would avoid that?).

I'm running with different shoes, but I'm traveling (light!) quite a lot and hence always looking for shoes that are easy to bring. I've been using the Nike Free RN 5.0 until they fell apart and bought Nike Free Run 2018 after, which I like a lot too. The main points for me really are that they are snug around the foot, have collapsible heels and generally are easy to squeeze into any side pocket of the backpacks - but I also have no trouble running the odd 10-15k with them.

Living in a smallish town it's a bit difficult to find shops with broad choices; Worse: Living in Europe it starts to be complicated to replace the Nike Frees, so I'm looking for alternatives and seeking some advice here.

I've googled a lot, and there seem to only few alternatives (Nike Flex? Atreyu? Puma Liberate Nitro 2?). There's also a bunch of the newer shoes with moon-boot soles (Adidas Takumi Sen 10, Saucony Endorphin) but I have the feeling that I'm getting too old for those (I like thin soles tbh, also because the shoes will fit into small pockets easier).

Does anybody have any good advice on the matter? Looking at reviews the shoes I find (above) seem to be deemed low-cost and low-quality, but are there any better shoes that are easy to pack with flexible heels? I've seen Merrel Trail Gloves, Salomon Sense Ride 5, or Altra Escalante Racer - but does anybody know if they have collapsible heels, and if they were any better?

I’m looking to set myself up with the right running shoes and looking for some
guidance. One question about existing shoes and one about what else to buy. Brief background:

- I’m 6’2, 35 years old, and generally hover around 90kg
- Patchy running history - did a fair bit in 2023 and ran a HM (1:50). Only did c.150km over 2024, but now getting back into it and want to take it a bit more seriously.
- Main focus for now is a HM in August. My current 5k is around 23m and 10k around 50m. Weekly volume will be around 30km on average for the near future.
- My previous shoes were the saucony endorphin shift 3 - I used them for everything and got on really well. They are just about dead though (coming apart at the side 😂)

I’ve just bought a pair of Adidas Evo SLs. I’ve done a couple of runs and whilst they do generally feel comfortable, I’m feeling like my heel is slipping / ankle is rolling a bit more than I’m used to. Did a few strides today and my knee felt a bit iffy at pace too. 

Should I just stick with the evo SLs and see how I go? Can the stability be improved a bit with lacing perhaps?

And… thoughts on what a good alternative might be? (I’m open to a second pair even if I warm to the Evo SLs.) If I could get another pair of shift 3’s I would as they were pretty much spot on for me, so thoughts along those lines welcome.

After about 5 sessions of no more than 7km I noticed some pain on the inside of my left ankle and after seeing some footage of me running I realised I have quite bad over pronation.

I went to a running shop today and they suggested the asics kayano 31. I don’t love the colour way but I can live with that if they have more support and help prevent injuries.

I guess my question is, are the HOKA’s salvageable, by getting insoles or only using them on certain runs? I’ve included the pictures from the gait analysis (light blue HOKA, dark blue asics)

Any other tips for helping over pronation would be much appreciated. It seems more painful in my left ankle, possibly compensating from a knee dislocation over 10 years ago. But it is apparent in both ankles.

I am a beginner runner. I bought Asics Venture 8 running shoes in the beginning for my running but they are just not doing it for me. They feel very unstable and not cushioned at all. I have slight overprotonation and am looking for a stability shoes as I am known to have weaker ankles. I have a medium arch and walk in a parallel stride but have a tendency to run slightly side to side. I have been looking into hokas and brooks. However I am open to any suggestions. I run mostly on the road and am looking for everyday shoes for running with short- moderate distances. I currently wear a 9.5 in women's shoes. I belive I also run more on my heels but I have neutral wear on my shoes, so overall cushion would be great. I would like to spend max around $155. ",2025-04-25 13:12:02+00:00,2,16
1k7kcsh,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Glycerin Max / Vomero 18 (fashion) advice & durability?,"Hi shoe nerds, I need your expert advice. I need new shoes, only for normal daily usage, no running. I have flat feet and my feet and legs hurt after few hours of walking so I need the best cushion I can get. My Asics Gel Nimbus 26 sadly gave up after 11 months, the fabric at the heels came off.

I got some Vomero 18 and Glycerin Max (and also the Bondi 8, but already decided against them as I heard multiple times Hoka tends to not last very long). I like both even though they feel different, the Glycerin Max is definitely something I'd need to get used to walking in. How would you choose? I'm unsure about the Vomero's durability. I want my shoes to last relatively long, especially the cushioning aside from the outside. All in all I'm tending more towards the glycerin max because the cushioning looks like it's more and I've read that Brooks make good quality shoes that last long.

Also, on the Glycerin Max I'm super uncertain about the color. I ordered the ""[aurora black/ebony](https://www.brooksrunning.com/de_de/damen/stra%C3%9Fenlaufschuh/glycerin-max/120436.html?dwvar_120436_color=166)"" color but the aurora thing is actually super glittery in real life so I'm tending towards the [pearlized white/bay](https://www.brooksrunning.com/en_us/womens/shoes/road-running-shoes/glycerin-max/120436.html?dwvar_120436_color=166) color instead (I'm talking about the female model). I love teal/blue colors and ordered the Vomeros in white with a nice teal nike logo. I've never worn white shoes before so how are they gonna look in the future? The lower part on my Asics is white and you can definitely see the wrinkles and everything, which was the reason why I ordered the glycerin in black. But I don't want to look like some mom in her 40s doing nordic walking or something and I'm just super uncertain with how I look in general and don't want to stand out. So I kind of want to swap to the white ones, they got a nice subtle blue touch and I also like the colors on the sole. Need your advice please!

1k7jal0,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Shoe decision: Zegama 2 vs Tomir 2,"
Dear community,

I need some help to decide between these two shoes:

Profile: I do own the Speedgoat 5 for races and more serious trail runs (at least for me more serious) and they are perfect for this (midpack runner), no issues at all. But they are for my more serious runs and I wouldn't wanna use them on roads or hikes.

I'm looking for an uncomplicated do-it-all-shoe and while I tried the Peg Trail 4 (way to slippy in wet pavement! The outsole rubber is so bad for my uses) and Challenger 7 (way to narrow toebox - seriously, unexplainable), I'm interested in the Zegama 2 and Tomir 2 for the following use cases:

Hiking, Road to trail runs and some travelling. I guess many would recommend the Peg Trail 5 which I am open to try but for the hikes in mountainous terrain I would really like a Vibram outsole.

I hear about the outsole replacement program for Nnormal - that's interesting! But is it useful? I mean the midsole probably breaks down anyway, I guess?

Opinions are welcome.",2025-04-25 12:07:18+00:00,1,12

I’ve just bought the Brooks Glycerin Max for my easy and long runs, which initial impressions (50km) are good - very soft! 

For daily running I have been alternating between ASICS Novablast 4 (500km) and Hoka Clifton 9 (650km). Feel the NB4s have got a bit more left in them, but my Hoka’s feel horrendous now so keen to get rid. 

My race (and tempo / track session) shoe has been the Endorphin Pro 3 (450km), which have done me 1 full and 2 halfs along with a load of track training (not sure how much these have got left).

I’m ideally looking for a 3 shoe rotation if possible, a pair for daily running and perhaps a bit of tempo, and a pair for races / track sessions. 

For daily running, I have been impressed with by NB4s so was tempted to go for the Novablast 5s albeit I’ve read some contrasting reviews? 

On the tempo / race front, I’m pretty open minded. I’ve looked at the Saucony Endorphin Pro 4 and the New Balance Rebel V4s, but not sure which way to go if I want to use them for half and marathon distance, with track sessions thrown in for good measure?

I’m not a runner, but I’ve been recommended to wear running shoes for daily use due to some knee discomfort. I’m looking for something with good cushioning and stability, as my feet tend to pronate a bit.

I really like the design of On shoes and have narrowed it down to these two:

**On Cloud X4**

* From what I’ve read, these are great for walking and light to moderate weight training. I usually hit the gym 2–3 times a week, so I was thinking it’d be convenient to wear these to work and then to the gym afterward.
* My only hesitation is that they’re neutral shoes—so I’m not sure if they’d provide enough support.

**On Cloudrunner 2**

* I like the thicker cushioning and the added arch support.
* But would I miss the versatility of the X4, especially for gym use?

I’m also looking at the **Asics Gel Kayano 31** and **Hoka Arahi 7**, but I find their designs a bit too sporty compared to the sleek look of On shoes.

I’ve run several half marathons, and I’ll be racing again this Sunday. But to be honest I want to cut to the chase: while I’ll continue running on the road, I’m shifting my focus toward longer distances, possibly a 50K.

I know it might sound strange to move into ultramarathons without having ticked off a full marathon, but to me, ultras seem more relaxed, with a chill community and less pressure. I get that this post might draw some criticism, but honestly whatever.

From here on out, I’m prioritizing casual runs, long runs, and easy paced efforts. That’s what I want running to be for me now.

I’m open to any suggestions. I’m currently running in Nike Pegasus Plus with about 400 miles on them. I was planning to switch to the Adidas Adizero Evo SL, but since my direction is changing, I’m now considering something more suited to this new phase possibly the Hoka Clifton 9 or 10?

Or, should I get a fresh pair of GMax for my summer marathon (San Francisco)? Or something else? Superblast seems obvious candidate but I tried it a couple of times and seems too firm.

Me: beginner runner 52yr 180lb, half marathon PR 2:05. Mid foot strike. I did well with wide stable shoes Bondi and Hurricane 24, but I want more cushion. I've run all my PRs in Glycerin Max. I want to believe they are just stable enough for me, though I've recently gotten a mild IT band issue after I had a big week. Months back I tried switching from the Hurricane to the softer Topo Atmos but I got knee problems I believe due to less medial stability of the Atmos vs Hurricane.

Hello! 
I have been running for barely 9 months. Training for my first half marathon in 3 weeks. It have been a journey to discover shoes that finally feel 100% good (First it was about discovering the over pronation, then issues about the second toe getting purple and on pain on just one foot and discovering I needed more sizing up). 
I wish to have a second pair pf stability shoes but I am unsure which one to choose. 
Currently I am training 3 times per week (Easy run, tempo and long run) and doing all with Kayano 30 (That kill the toe sometimes) and the kayano 31 that are perfect. I wish to include a new pair to stop using the kayano 30.

I have been researching and the options are basically:

- Saucony Guide 18
•	⁠Brooks Launch GTS 10
•	⁠Hoka Arahi 7
•	⁠New Balance Fresh Foam X 860v14

Does anyone with over pronation has any advice on which one select? Or you think I shall continue with just the kayano 31 for all training sessions + race day? (They will be around 300kms).

Hey, I keep hearing that the Nike Vomero 18 is Nike’s most comfortable shoe, but what does “comfortable” actually mean in this case? Does it mean super plush? Memory foam-like? Or something else exactly?

Right now, I wear the Nike React Infinity Run 4s (RN4s I believe) they’re honestly amazing and the most comfortable, plush shoes I’ve had so far. I’m not a runner, just someone who goes on long casual walks daily. Also I've seen the invincible 3s and I don't know if they'd be more plush/comfortable than the infinity react run 4? 

I really want to buy the Vomero 18s, but I saw a YouTube review where the person said, “Yeah, they’re comfortable… but firm.” That’s kind of where I’m confused, because I don’t think I’m into firm shoes—unless they soften after breaking in?

The reason I’m asking is because I also have the Pegasus 40s and 41s. The 40s were okay, not super comfortable but better than the 41s. The 40s felt kind of flat when walking—like a dull slap or clap underfoot. Then I got the 41s hoping they’d be an upgrade, but they actually made my feet, legs, and joints sore after walks—and the pain would carry into the next day, which never happened with the 40s.

So what am I missing here? Is the Vomero 18 more like the Infinity Run 4 or the Invincible 3 in terms of plush comfort? Or is it more on the firm side like the Pegasus? I’d really appreciate some clarification before I buy.",2025-04-24 12:17:50+00:00,6,60

Coming from A smaller size (uk 8) Asics cumulus 23 and gel venture 9 (amplifoam), had a lot of pain in my mid foot and ball of the foot and I figured I needed something cushier and with more stack and figured I just need the nimbus.   
  
 So I borrowed my friend's half size up Asics nimbus 25 and have had it for a few days. it definitely took away the pain in the ball of my feet and helped me walk faster but I just couldnt even run for 10 seconds in them. I felt I was landing heavy and I could feel more pressure on my knees which wasnt the case with the firmer shoes shoes before. which leads me to think that yes i need more cushioning on my forefoot but perhaps I need something lighter and well not something im completely sinking into.

So here is my shortlist based on whats available here ($-$$$). The price range is doable

1 - Asics Cumulus 25 ($) - Im guessing its not as plush and (v26 is a no go since no outsole)

1k6js13,AskRunningShoeGeeks,"Size 13, Wide Mid Foot: Looking for a shoe recommendation","Hey AskRSG, looking for a shoe recommendation.

My biggest issue to date is with my right foot. My mid foot is striking/landing off of the sole after 20-25 minutes into my run. In most cases I'm assuming this is due to lack of mid foot width accommodation.

Based on the few evaluations I've gotten, I tend to pronate a small amount while running.  
When trying on shoes, my mid foot will 'bulge' out the side a lot of the times.

Below is a list of shoes I've tried on and/or ran in which didn't accommodate my feet:  
Adidas Boston 12  
Asics Nova blast 4  
Brooks Glycerin GTS 21  
Hoka Skyflow  
Hoka Skyflow (Wide)  
New Balance 1080 v13 (Wide)  
New Balance Rebel v4 (Wide)  
Nike Invincible 3

Saucony Kinvara  
Hoka Gaviota  
Brooks Glycerin 22  
Topo Atmos  
Asics Gel Kayano 31 (Wide)  
Adidas Ultraboost 5

To date, my best experience has been in the Skyflows. Sadly they gave me foot pains after two miles due to improper landing.

I've also had some luck in the Asics Tri Noosa 14, however the foam falls a bit too flat for me on longer runs.

Any help or thoughts are appreciated, thanks!

1k6j5cd,AskRunningShoeGeeks,"Specter 2 almost done, Speed 4 brand new — what’s the perfect complement?","I’m looking to refresh my shoe rotation and could use some help choosing what to add next. I’m a male runner, 155 lbs, averaging about 30 miles per week. My PR for a 5K is 23 and my PR for the 1/2 is 1:56. My weekly runs include a mix of easy days, long runs, and some tempo or speedwork. I’ve dealt with runner’s knee in the past. Also worth noting: zero-drop shoes don’t work for me at all but mid level (5mm) has worked fine.

Right now, my rotation includes two shoes. The Topo Specter 2 has been my all-time favorite — I love the rocker, the responsive cushioning, and the fit. That pair is nearing the end though, with around 50 miles left. I also recently picked up the Endorphin Speed 4, and I’m really liking it for speed days and tempos. That one’s brand new and will stay in rotation.

In the past, I’ve also really enjoyed the Nike Vomero 17 — it was a solid daily trainer that struck a good balance for me. On the flip side, I didn’t get along with the Novablast 4, which I think may have contributed to a bout of runner’s knee — it felt too unstable and bouncy. I’ve also tried the Brooks Glycerin Max, but found it way too soft and plush for my liking. In general, Brooks hasn’t worked well for me ever. I have run in the Alphafly a few times with no issues. Just for context. 

My budget is up to $275. I’m open to picking up another pair of the Specter 2 and possibly adding in a 3rd race shoe on top of that (Endorphin Elite 2?) Right now, I’m considering the EVO SL, Superblast 2, Saucony Triumph 22, or the upcoming Topo Phantom 4 (May 2025 I think).

So here’s what I’m wondering: What would make a good daily trainer or long-run shoe to pair with the Speed 4? And should I be easing into something new now, while I still have some life left in the Specter 2? Would love to hear from anyone who’s transitioned away from the Specter 2 — or has a recommendation for something with a similar feel.

1k6htdg,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Arch Blisters Brooks Adrenaline GTS 24,"
Hi all,

As the title suggests, I’ve just bought a new pair of running shoes, went out for a 5km and came back with arch blisters. The blisters are at the higher end of my arch close to the ball of my foot. I’m not sure if it’s a sock thing as I wasn’t wearing proper running ones. However, I wore them again a couple days later and they’re still rubbing. I got a gait analysis when I brought them and was told I over-pronate in one foot hence I need stability. So not sure if maybe I’d be better off in a neutral shoe? Or is it just this particular shoe in general? For context, I used to run in a Mizuno wave rider 23 and this is my first time upgrading in 5 years 😅 

Any advice would be appreciated. ",2025-04-24 02:51:58+00:00,2,5

\- \*\*Budget:\*\* \~$80–$100(sale prices)  

\- \*\*Intended use:\*\* Easy runs, gym‑complement, occasional long run (up to 6mi)  but he's never ran more then a 5k as of now

\- \*\*Foot shape:\*\* Normal width  

\- \*\*Shoe weight preference:\*\* ?? not too sure but he does prefer something not thick but he's played in heavier basketball shoes so his idea of light vs heavy may be skewed

\- \*\*Preferred feel:\*\* Balanced cushion—enough softness for recovery but stable underfoot

The Superblast are basically the best shoes I have ever tried and I would not hesitate to use them for a Marathon but I am looking for something with a plate to increase my efficiency without sacrificing comfort and stability too much.
But as for race shoes I often read that they get almost completely destroyed within 100-300 km which I would not accept for that price. I have found a pair of Hyperion Elite 4 withe the upper seeming to get holes after only 80 km.

Now that I've tasted speed/tempo/whatever types of shoes, my daily drivers feel sluggish.  Should have stuck with one shoe and remained blissful in my ignorance.

Here are the shoes I've been running in over the last 4 months:

* **Hoka Bondi 9**: I won a pair in a Strava challenge. They're fine, a little locked down. Too squishy for daily running or racing; but they're fantastic for me on recovery days. I feel like an elderly person driving one of those boat-sized Cadillacs when running in them. I won't get there fast, but I also won't feel a single bump in the road. Don't plan to change these.
* **Topo Phantom 3**: I've more or less used these as my workhorse over the last 18 months after ditching Altra. Logged 1500+ miles over many pairs of these. Love the fit, and I even ran 3 marathons in these last year. They're fine. Maybe good. But now that I've tasted the ""snap"" that other shoes can have... I would love to race in something more responsive.
* **Saucony Endorphin Speed 4**: The root of the problem for me. I love these shoes. At least, as long as I run less than 16 miles. I'm \~240 miles into them, and love the response for speedwork and going fast. *I really, really wish I could race in these*. However, when I go long, things start to *hurt*. It feels like the whole front pad of my foot gets warm, but not like blisters-warm. Its just a hurt-warm. Especially the side by my pinky toes. As I adjust to compensate for pain, it just turns into a spiral that inevitably leads to having to stop the run. I've tried 4 different kinds of socks, and changing the lacing from normal to a heel-lock to moderate success - Feetures Elite + lacing change lets me get 16 instead of 12 in these.

Is there a ""fast"" shoe that might work better for me, knowing I seem to thrive in those Topos? I've got a race(marathon) in May, and would love to have a broken-in pair of fast shoes to help me set that PR i've been after.

Additional context:

* I think I'm a midfoot striker
* I'm running 40-60 miles per week right now
* Tend toward longer distances
* Speedwork usually happens at 6:50-7:20 min/mi ranges right now

1k5y0hv,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Brooks Beast 24 GTS feel like absolute bricks after a few runs,"Hey All,

I recently went to my local running store and got fitted for a new pair of running shoes. After running up and down their track so they could perform an analysis on how my foot lands and rolls and the way the impact is distributed, they recommended the Brooks Beast 24 GTS to me.

Now I’m used to having rather stable shoes, as I’ve had Arahi 6’s and Saucony Omni 22 as my last daily running shoes.

Their advice was to go for an - even more stable shoe and the Beast 24 GTS measured best according to the sales associate.

I’ve taken them out on 2 runs so far (17,5km and 11,5km), doing mostly Z2 at a 4:50-5:00 min/km pace with some Z4 acceleration in there. I can’t help but feel like the shoes are clunky and lack any sort of “pop”, which I did have with my previous shoes.  
They feel heavy (which does make sense given their considerable weight) and I can’t help but feel sluggish regardless of the pace I’m running at.  
They’re not making me excited to go run whatsoever to be honest.

I’m training for an Ironman, so have to do between 50-60 km a week, so I do want a shoe that’s enjoyable to lace up, but won’t cause significant injuries.

Has anybody had similar experiences with these? Do they get “better” as they wear in?

Any other shoes to look at (besides the Omni or Arahi) that would offer a more enjoyable experience?  
The sales rep advised against models like the Guide saying that they wouldn't be ""stable"" enough.

Sidenote: I also find the shoes to be very dull and think they look super boring, so not excluding that that might also have an impact on my experience lol.

I'm a beginner in running for 2-3 months. I run once a week between 5 and 10 Km at a rythm of 6:00 - 7:00. (I know is slow :) ). I'm looking to buy a new running shoe.

I already ran with Ascis Gel Excite 9, NB Fresh Foam X 880 v12 and Puma Velocity Nitro 3.

Of these the one I like less was NB X880 v12. The sole is little bit large and very soft. I felt I lost a lot of energy runnig because it was soft and made my running a bit more slow and tiring.

The second I liked less was the Puma Velocity Nitro 3. I bought a bigger size (1 cm bigger to give space for the toes as recommend), but I feel the heel is not well ""locked"" inside the shoe and have to tie the laces with more strenght, so I feel the feet are a bit tighted inside the shoe. I also feel the shoe is slightly bulky and big.

Of these shoes the one I like the most is the cheaper ones: Asics Gel Excite 9. They are light, slim, not to big/heavy/bulky and the sole is not too soft and with a good response (could give much more energy).

I don't know if my experience with these shoes is conditioned because I'm still a beginner and I don't have yet much experience. I was thinking about Asics Novablast 5 or Adidas Adizero SL because they have good reviews in www.runrepeat.com. But I think Novablast 5 is too soft and Adidas Adizero SL not sure if they are good for me.

These shoes feel SO dampened compared to the v13 and my toes/feet started going a bit numb after about a mile. My legs felt like they were working hard to turn over. I’m super bummed because I was really looking forward to this shoe. 

Do I need to give them more time to break in? My v13s needed little to no time to break in, and I know they’re different shoes, but I can’t help but compare.

If you have any other shoes to recommend for an easy long run shoe, let me know. As of rn I’m thinking to return these and get the Magmax’s. Already tried the glycerin max and couldn’t consistently get good runs out of them - they aggravated my post tib and worked my calves more than I liked.

I just got my **Adios Pro 4** and haven’t taken them out for a run yet (trying to keep them returnable just in case), but I wanted to ask something first:

When I stand in them, I feel a noticeable **pressure right under the arch** of my foot. It almost feels like it’s coming from the **energy rods**—specifically from the area where the three lines are visible on the outsole. When I press that spot from underneath, it gives the **same sensation** I feel when I’m just standing in them.

At first I thought it was the rods themselves, but now I’m wondering if it might be **coming from the side or midsole support structure** pressing into the arch. My feet are slightly wide, but I don’t think it’s a width issue—it feels more like something under or slightly inside the arch.

So before I take them out on a run and commit to them, I wanted to ask:

* Has anyone else felt this kind of arch pressure in the Adios Pro 4 right out of the box?
* Did it go away once you started running or broke them in?

1k57c81,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Do I need stability shoes / neutral shoes with supportive orthotic insoles??,"Hi everyone,

I run a moderate amount each week. I did a basic gait analysis at a running shop about 10-12 years ago and was recommended a stability/support shoe. Ended up going with the On Cloudflyer at the time but I've never really been that satisfied with them. I recently switched over to the Saucony Ride 18 and have tried them with custom orthotics, which didn't feel right as they have a leathery upper and my foot was sliding around in the shoes, as well OTC insoles like Superfeet, Currex and Sole, but but I’m always conscious of the insert either pushing up into my arch or not being properly aligned with the arch.

I’ve linked a short slow‑motion clip of my stride below (I read somewhere here that barefoot is the best way to analyze) and I think I'm seeing a bit of overpronation on both feet. What I'm wondering is whether the overpronation looks mild enough that neutral shoes are fine (without supportive insoles), or would I be better off in stability shoes (or neutrals with insoles)??

For those who use insoles in neutral shoes, did your arches eventually “forget” the insert was there, or should they be un‑noticeable from day one?

Anyone land on a happy middle‑ground that doesn’t feel overly corrective?

Really appreciate any advice or anecdotes. My goal is simply to keep training consistently and avoiding injuries.

I'm looking for recommendations for shoes or other tips to stop blisters on the inside of my foot, on the sides, caused by overpronation.

I’ve seen **three different podiatrists**, all of whom diagnosed me with **pretty overpronation**. I've got orthotics. Thanks to strength, I no longer have knee/hip pain, which is great — **but I still constantly get blisters on the inside part of the ball of my foot, right under the big toe**. It's super frustrating. I even wore a hole in the side of my Triumph 22s at that spot.

I’m currently running in the **Saucony Triumph 22** (I used the 21 before that). For reference, my actual foot size is EU 38, but I always size up to 39. I’ve also tried different socks (currently using **Thyo La Double, french brand**). I apply **Akileïne Nok anti-friction cream** every night and before every run, and **a foot-toughening lotion (Akileïne Tano)** every morning for a month leading up to a race. Still the blisters keep coming...

Now I’m thinking of switching shoes — even though all the podiatrists told me to stick with the ones I have and said there’s nothing else they can do (very helpful 🙃). But I just want these blisters to stop!

I'm preparing for my **first marathon**, and I’d like to test a new pair of shoes before I start training.

Some people say I should pair my orthotics **with a stability shoe** (like the Brooks Adrenaline), others say it’s a bad idea. One podiatrist recommended the **Brooks Glycerin**, but others told me it’s not stable enough for overpronators.

So now I’m just trying to find a pair with a **wider toe box**, in hopes that it will help solve the blister issue once and for all.

at the beginning of my running training i went to a shoe store and had them do an analysis and suggest some shoes. also for context, i have very small feet. i know it’s recommended to size up half a size but i think i may have sized up closer to a full size because not all brands carry sizes small enough for me. i have been training in asics novablast 5s, and at first i loved them, but i’ve found that on my longer runs my feet start to hurt and i’ve been getting blisters. most of my blisters have been on the bottom of my big toe but during my race i got pretty bad blisters on the balls of my feet that started close to 3 miles into the race😭

i also feel some joint pain after my long runs, specifically my knees and my ankles. i’m not sure how much of this can be attributed to my shoes and how much is just me being new to running and my body adjusting. and could it be possible that my feet are sliding around more because the shoes are too big and that’s what’s causing the blisters so bad? 

additionally any advice on other shoes to try is more than welcome!! i am a mid/forefoot striker and i *think* i prefer a more cushioned shoe but what do i know lol. i have normal width feet and no overpronation issues",2025-04-22 01:09:18+00:00,2,6

Before my first marathon last year, I used to race in AP3 without any problem, tough the upper wasn’t super comfortable. I also did most of my LRs in Superblast which I really liked, and at the end of the training cycle my mother gave me SB2, which I really loved, thought they fit me a little short and my nails get hurt after really LRs.

I wanted a plate for the marathon but also more comfort than the AP3 gave me, so I bought EP4 and I really liked out of the box, did a couple of long runs and workouts in them and instantly felt they were the shoe for the marathon. After km 30 I really started to feel the stiffness of the plate and whishing I had gone with SB2 for the marathon.

For my second marathon I’m training for a sub4, but I really feel I I’m the 3:55 shape.

I just did a 23k with MP 15 days before the race with EP4 and really liked them. Should I give them another chance? Should I do it with the shorter SB2?

1k4itqb,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Trying to Rotate Running Shoes—Is This a Good Move?,"I ran my first marathon this past February, and since then I've been more in ""maintenance"" mode than active training. My mileage dropped from about 40-50 miles per week down to roughly 20-30.

For the last part of my marathon prep, I mostly wore Karhu Mestari Run shoes, which quickly became my all-time favorite. However, I have this paranoia that I'll get overly dependent on one shoe model, only to have it discontinued—then I'll end up dealing with injuries while adjusting to something new.

So, last Saturday I visited a specialty running shoe store in town and shared this concern with the salesperson. He mentioned that different shoes can activate different muscle groups, and recommended that I start rotating my Karhu Mestari Runs with another shoe, the Altra Experience Flow. The main difference is in heel-to-toe drop: Mestari has an 8mm drop, whereas the Experience Flow has a 4mm drop.

He warned me that my calves and legs might complain initially due to the lower drop, but assured me I'd adjust over time and become a stronger runner overall.

I'm curious about your thoughts on this approach. I just did a 4-mile run in the Experience Flows, and my legs are definitely letting me know about it, lol!",2025-04-21 17:13:18+00:00,2,5

So I went for my run today, and realized that I basically run in a garden every day. I do about 200 meters on the road and then the rest is around a park that's all mulch, gravel trails, and soft dirt with the occasional muddy spot here and there.

I've always thought ""trail shoes"" were a bit overkill for this, but road shoes don't really work either (little fragments of mulch get stuck in the foam like splinters haha). So what would be a good ""garden"" running shoe? Plus, I really want waterproof shoes.

•Daily trainer

•No abnormalities with my feet.

•Midfoot striker

1k4gdh5,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Toe Rockers and Calf Issues,"I’ve been dealing with calf issues for the last couple months as I try and get back in shape before starting training for my 1st marathon. Believe the issues are with my soleus muscle, though I’m not 100% certain. Not here for medical advice though, just wanted to get some input on my theory with the shoes.

The shoes I’ve been using over this time period are Brooks Glycerin Max which were recommended by my local running store. The other day I tried something different as I haven’t found relief in any other methods I’ve tried. I decided to try a run in some old Hoka Cliftons (I think 8s) I had from years back. My calves felt so much better on my run in these shoes. 

My theory: The Brooks Gylcerin have a much more pronounced toe rocker compared to my Hokas. I’ve played sports like football and Soccer basically year round my whole life, which I think the sprinting involved in those sports have shaped my running form to be more mid-forefoot striking. When doing training for a marathon, I am not going for pace most runs, which results in me using less of my stride. In the Brooks I think this is causing me not to get the full benefit from that toe rocker and is actually disrupting my natural running motion, causing more strain on my calves. I have noticed when I do push pace more and open my stride in the Brooks, my calves actually feel better. But for my first marathon, this pace would be unsustainable for my training. During my run with the Hokas, they felt sooo much more natural on my feet compared to the Brooks. With a less pronounced toe rocker, I interpret this feeling as them being more suited to my natural running motion, especially on slower paced runs.

So my question to the running shoe geeks here is if my theory has validity, or if this is all in my head. 


Some variables that could explain away the shoe difference: immediately before my run in the Hokas, I did a calf workout that I’ve been doing for the last couple weeks hoping strengthening my calves would relieve my issues. Could be that I have not been doing enough warm up before my runs in the Brooks and this workout warmed my calves up enough to run without issues. However, I typically stretch a lot before every run, and never had issues in past years when doing longer slower runs. And given how much more natural the Hokas felt, I feel like that has to mean something.",2025-04-21 15:29:09+00:00,3,6

I haven’t done much running since, but I now do daily cardio on the treadmill walking at an incline and I do want to get back into running. According to the fancy scanner thing, I have average feet and gait. I’m on the narrower side and my arches are slightly flat and I have a teeny bit of pronation. 

For the last two years or so, I’ve been wearing regular Vans slip ons or old skools on the treadmill. 20-30 mins every day, zero issues, zero discomfort, zero pain. Since I want to get back into running, I’ve started looking into running shoes. 

I bought a pair of Rincon 4s and had to return them because they were killing my feet, particularly in the arch but also had some pain in my 5th metatarsals. I read this is a common issue with Hokas. I returned them and bought a pair of Clifton 9s in wide. Didn’t help at all, they were just as painful in my arch and 5th metatarsal and my feet were swimming in them because I don’t have wide feet.

I returned them and bought a pair of New Balance 880 V14s in standard width. I don’t feel as much discomfort in my arch, but still some. These hurt my 5th metatarsals more than the hokas. I started some short 1-2 mile runs recently but these hurt so bad that they are what cut my runs short, not my shitty cardio that’s a fraction of what it used to be 7+ years and 50lbs ago. 

Playing soccer, a lot of my cleats I wore gave me the same 5th metatarsal issues but I never had them in the old Nikes I used to wear. 

But again, I’ll step into my normie vans and I can walk forever on the treadmill with zero discomfort, zero pain. 

What’s up with this, do my feet not like cushion and support?",2025-04-20 19:13:54+00:00,2,2
1k3u1zh,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Daily trainer similar to Asics Hyperspeed 3?,"



My current daily trainer is Asics Gel Nimbus 25 but I find like they drag me down and makes me feel like my feet are bricks and each stride just get heavier and causes knee pain.


I use the Hyperspeed for my speed runs and sometimes my easy run and it really makes a difference. I feel like my feet are lighter, less exhausted and less pain. I just can't really do long runs with them as it feels uncomfortable around 10km.

Anyone can recommend a good daily trainer that's similar to this (and possibly a heel drop of 4-6mm)?

1k3t47b,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Novablast 5 sizing advice,"Hello community,

  
I would like to seek your input for choosing a size for the Novablast 5.  
I have rather wide feet and I often buy the model 2E in 9.5US when available (Saucony Triumph, Hoka clifton).

For the Novablast 5, the first time I went to the store I chose to take them in TTS (9.5US) since they seem to fit wide in the toe box area. But after spending more time with them I am wondering if 10 would have been the better choice .

the model in wide is not available where I am, so it will be between these 2 sizes.

I put the comparison in the photo.

I feel the 9.5 are a bit too tight : my pinky is rubbing a bit and I can feel the tip of the shoes when going downhill (not painful). Let's say it is very snug.

the size 10 is much roomier, but I am wondering if  my foot will not have too much space and move too much causing blister.

1k3kxrm,AskRunningShoeGeeks,What shoes should I buy/wear for long training runs?,"Recommendations for good long run shoes?

I run about 25 miles per week, training for a half marathon as a “middle of the pack” runner. I used the Brooks Adrenaline GTS for years as the only shoe that I would wear… I had done a fit test years ago and they said at the time I was over pronating and recommended stability shoes so I got those and didn’t look back, just replacing as I wore them down. At one point I tried the Saucony Guide bc I liked the colorway and it was uncomfortable and I wound up getting injured.

 I have been gifted some other shoes and tried a few others. This is my current shoe rotation:
- Nike Pegasus Turbo (using for track workouts) - these are my comfiest shoes atm but I’m not sure how long they’ll last so I’ve been using more sparingly
- Nike Vomero - very comfy but I’ve been getting blisters. I’ve been using as my daily trainer and for long runs.
- Brooks Adrenaline - I’m overdue for replacement. The uppers are so comfortable but now they feel so heavy as a daily trainer. 
- Nike Structure - I tried and returned… prefer the Adrenaline to this when opting for a more supportive shoe.

Ideally for my long runs (9-13mi) I’d like a more comfortable shoe that’s on the lighter side but has structure. The Vomeros feel a bit too thick on the top, the Pegasus are comfortable but idk if they’re supportive enough for regular long runs, and the Adrenaline feel too clunky for that length. I’m thinking Brooks Hyperion GTS combines what I’m looking for, but are there any other shoes that I should consider?

And which of the above (either what I buy for long run or one I already have) should I use for race day? I’m assuming it isn’t worthwhile to invest in a supershoe for the race given that I’m a middle of the packer.

Thank you!

A few other notes:
- my feet are a bit wide but I wear regular width shoes. The Adrenaline toe box is great, as is the Pegasus. The vomero is a little narrow.
- I prefer firm over cushy, though the Vomero is the first cushy shoe I’ve worn and my knees seem very happy about them.
- it seems like most of the shoes are in the same price range (~$150 give or take) so budget isn’t really a consideration - I’d wear these regularly and after my incident with the Guides (which were no cheaper) I just want good shoes for me
- the Vomeros are the first shoes that have a higher stack that I’ve run in. I didn’t think I’d like that but it doesn’t seem to bother me either, so I’m agnostic.

Also, not sure if this matters at all, but I train with a one of the “Nike partner groups” so I think it’s a bonus if I wear Nikes on race day at least, but there’s no requirement to. So first and foremost want to figure out the best shoe for me for foot health, and if it happens to be a good race day shoe too and Nike, great, but won’t compromise for a specific brand either (eg if Brooks is the best for my feet, I’m going with Brooks.) The only brand I don’t want to wear is Saucony given my prior experience.",2025-04-20 11:57:41+00:00,2,9

1k3htxv,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Road to trail shoe advice,"Hello folks. I’ve been a Reddit lurker for ages to get opinions but finally joined today. I wanted to get some fellow runner experience/ thoughts on some decent road to trail style running shoes. A bit of (slightly lengthy, apologies) background on me first. Which maybe helps in my final question…

I’m in the UK and I’ve been running for about 25 years. Used to do long distance but since late 40s and into my 50s I’ve pared back the distances due to various niggles and injuries. I run about 2-3 times a week these days, and run anything between 5-10k and don’t race. I just run because I love it And to stay healthy.

I’ve pretty much spent most of my running life in ASICS GT stability shoes and have run in the various iterations of them until about four years back when i noticed they seemed to not feel as nice so I switched to kayanos I’ve been in stability shoes because I had a gait analysis back in 2004 at a London marathon expo and they recommended I try stability shoes as, according to them, I was a pronator. So until just recently I’d always assumed I need a stability shoe.

the past few years the aches and pains have been an occasional part of my running but never enough for me to be concerned I’d always put it down to ageing and they’d come and go. I got some kayano 30s last autumn and I’ve never enjoyed running in them. felt like two lifeless marshmallows on my feet so I finally got myself down for a gait analysis at my local running shop and to check out some other shoe brands. I’m so glad I did. It turns out I’m in fact a neutral runner! with high arches. i tried on various shoes and ended up getting some Karhu Mestari Run 1.5 shoes and they’ve vastly improved my running experience. My knees have stopped aching post run and the quality of the running is noticeably better. I could kick myself for not doing this sooner but I’d got set in my ways I guess and seeing as I’d had years of great running in the ASICS GTs I didn’t want to change shoes as they had been ok for me. I run with an orthotic insole due to an older heel spur injury and to aid with my high arches.

so, to my reason for posting in the first place. I mostly run on tarmac and gravelly cinder and river paths but I do also sometimes run on rougher terrain that gets muddy and slippy and filthy in the wetter and winter months so I’m now looking for a trail shoe, possibly waterproof, that would work alongside my new Karhu shoes in terms of cushioning and comfort. I don’t need a full on fell or mountain running shoe. Just something with some extra grip and maybe a goretex or similar lining as the park run I do has some big deep puddles on rainy days.

im not racing  I just want a comfortable shoe for day to day running, nothing to heavy or un responsive but some decent cushioning would be nice .

I did run last winter in ASICS Trabuco Max 3. as far as cushioning they were ok but I’ve got fairly wobbly ankles and I got too many ankle bends and pains running downhill on scrambly terrain due to their stack height. I’ve also tried Hoka challengers but they made my outer foot sore.

so far I’ve been looking at Hoka Speedgoats, Merrell Agility peak and Karhu Ikoni trail.

id be interested to hear some other recommendations if people have them.

My activity level which was low, went to zero, and now I want to increase my activity and even get into running as my pain has been more or less managed (but could be better). So I am looking for 3 shoes for rotation.

Budget: $200 max per shoe. Open to investing in high quality shoes if it's worth it. I expect to pay $100-140 per shoe.

Intended Use:

Primary : Long walking mix indoors/outdoors like vacations to theme parks or museums and hopefully jogging outside once weather is nicer. 20k+ steps a day easily.

Secondary: Gym work outs (lifting, treadmill incline walk/run) around 2-3 mile sessions at the gym.

Tertiary : Everyday errands, office wear indoors, stairs, factory floors. 5-15k steps.

Foot size/shape: Women's 6.5-7B. Narrow heel, small ball girth & low instep. Overall slight asymmetry between left and right feet where right is slightly smaller.

Pronation & foot strike: Mild overpronation, low to moderate arch with some flexibility & heel/midfoot striker. Overall I need guidance and stability in my shoes and support for the ball of my feet due to ongoing pain.

Shoe Weight preference: light or moderate wight is nice, I'm trying to avoid anything too heavy or bulky.

Preferred feel: Softer cushioned ride for being on feet all day but firm enough to not sink in to the shoes or aggravate pain. Firmness more important for gym shoe. To give an idea - Asics Gel Kayano 29 were too soft & sinking in for the ball of my foot it was painful after 10 min wear on the tread while brooks Ariel 24 were too firm.

Previous Shoes I've Liked:

Nike Zoom Structure 22: My holy Grail. I wore these into the ground and then some. Loved the sown in tongue and the support I felt. I tried the 24, when it came out and hated it.

Saucony tempus 1: What replaced my Nike 22's as the best thing all around. But when wearing on tread or pavement inner arches start to hurt lately and ankles are a bit wobbly. My go to 20k stepper I wish to make better.

Brooks Adrenaline GTS 23: My current Gym/Errand shoe I wear everywhere. A bit not cushioned enough for actual jogs outdoors or on the tread but perfect for 30 min powerwalks (3.5-4.3mph) and 3 hours of errands before I start to feel it.

New Balance 860v14: Recent acquisition to try and give my GTS 23s a break for everyday and gym use. Still out on final comments but preferred them over GTS 24 at the store.

Previous Shoes I've Disliked:

Asics Gel Kayano 29: feels fine standing, but heel sneaks out even when tightly laced and feel the pavement too much through the gel for pain in ball of foot - do not run in these ever.

Brooks Ariel 24: too firm hurt within first minute of walking in them.

I'm looking for sugestions on what shoes to consider for my next set of runners. 

Currently running most sessions in Boston 12s, with a pair of Asics Noosa Tri 15's for some slower cruise/recovery runs. (Eg, last run in the Noosa's was 50mins at 5:40/km pace with HR sub 160.)

About me. 

Mid 30s, 5""10/179cm 195lb/88kg
5km PB April '25 - 22:35. 
Weekly volume 10-35km. (2-4 sessions per week) 
Long term running goal is to try and do a 20min 5k.

As you can see, I'm no speed demon or lightweight. 

What I like about the Boston 12s and Noosa Tri 15s.  
- Stable. For reference I find both of these slightly unstable going around hairpins amd sharper corners. But generally they are rock solid. Just a reference point.
- Firm direct feel. The Bostons are king here, while the Noosas are a close second but feel more ""natural"" for want of a better term.
- Durability. I dont want a shoe that needs replacing every 300kms. 
- I tend to prefer more of a snug fit than most and both uppers are able.to be snugged down. 

Runners I've previously tried.

- NB SC Trainer V3s. Shelved after about 5 runs. They just felt too unstable and I always strugled with pace in these. May take them out again for a revisit to make sure it wasnt just a string of crappy sessions. 
- NB Rebel V4. Running in them always felt awful and dead. Like all my energy and turnover was dumped into the ground each step. 
- Asics Novablast V2.  Not the worst generally, but never felt stable enough and didn't enjoy them. 
- Hoka Clifton 9 (passed on to me by a mate when I first started running again and were a size too big.) Liked the feel and rocker, but got hotspots on my inner arch.) 

In-store try ons. 
- Adiddas AP3s. Felt great in the shop. Very bouncy and poppy. Stability felt ok doing the standard walk/jog around the shop. Feel like it may be too much shoe for my shorter runs and training intent. 
-Brooks Hyperion Max 2. Felt fast and liked the fit, but concerned about stability. (Again, just a store walk around.)

My current Boston 12s are starting to look tired and I've racked up the kilometrs on them. Time to start looking to replace them. 

With the Boston 13s just being released, I'm unsure if I should hold off to try them out (seems sensible), just wait for Boston 12 sales and stock up, or consider another brand/model shoe offering. 

Open to and appreciate any suggestions from the group. (My experience with the SC Trainer V3 has shown that forum trawling and in store try ons can still land an off pair of shoes if unlucky.)",2025-04-19 23:54:30+00:00,9,7

I do notice that there is a slight bulge in the midfoot when running but I have had this bulge in other shoes I have ran with. Including some cheap beach running shoes that had less structure and more flexible, stretchy fibre that wrapped around my foot, of which I had no problem running with until the hard plastic on the bottom kept slapping against my foot. I bought Altra shoes for the wide toe box, and I have a perfect amount of room for my toes; but I think my midfoot is larger and more chunky than average so the shoe is a bit small around that part, causing pain there. Should I size up to solve the problem? However this might result in the length and overall size of shoe to be too large. Or is there any larger midfoot shoes out there for running in? Or even a less built up running shoe with more stretchy fabric that allows for more flexibility for your foot to splay out in.

Looking for recommendations for a racing shoe for my upcoming 10k race, where I am aiming for sub 42. I'm currently using the EVO SL for my faster efforts, but I would like to try out a fast plated shoe for this race.

Current rotation is NB5 for easy miles (don't like it very much), EVO SL for some easy, tempo and workouts, PXS2 long runs (nearing retirement). Quite normal gait, at least no issues with stability even tho I feel like I pronate a little.

The main thing I'm confused about is whether to go for a more marathon oriented shoe (AF3 for example) or a faster and snappier ride (think TS10 and similar shoes). I would really appreciate if anyone has some good input on how to think in this situation, and would love any recommendations!

Edit: Thinking about going with the AP4 as it seems great for basically all distances and with relatively good durability. Does anyone who owns both know if they fit similar in terms of both fit and sizing to the EVO SL?",2025-04-19 18:59:38+00:00,6,5

I am currently looking at the Vaporfly 3 and Puma Deviate Nitro Elite 3. However, in my local running store, they are priced very similarly to the Adios Pro 4 (which would probably offer more).

Should I stick with the VF3 / DNE3, or get the AP4 instead?


For Context:

I'm an average guy, a little below 70kgs heavy, and a year into running. I am a bit slow at around 5:30-5:45/km pace. And I understand that a lot would say a carbon plated shoe is necessary. But I am conflicted as some would say these supershoes can still shave off some seconds from my time, and I am quite curious as well.

I use the Novablast 5 for daily runs and Puma Deviate Nitro 3 for faster runs / workouts.

1k2jr4r,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Lasting daily trainer recommendation,"Hi all, am in the market for a new daily trainer to do most of my easy to long runs in. 

I'm a 5'7 M ~60kg, training to do a HM around 1:55 soon. I'm currently using the Asics Gel Cumulus 25 as my daily trainers and have got almost 600km on them. They're holding up pretty good but I can tell they're starting to age and am looking for a replacement. I've recently got a pair of Puma DN2s to do more speed work in and I aim to use those for my upcoming HM as they're a bit more snappy and responsive than the Asics. 

I've previously used the Cumulus 23's and those did me great. I ended up replacing them for the 25's around the 800km mark and Ive really liked the Cumulus series as they're a pretty solid no nonsense shoe with good enough durability to last me awhile. However, with the updated rubberized-EVA outsoles of the 26 and 27, im looking to hop onto a different shoe as Im not the biggest fan of no rubber grip on the outside.

I've been looking at the Novablast 4/5 and the Rebel 4 and have heard they're really versatile shoes with good cushioning but fairly responsive as well, but I've also heard that both lose that spark in them after about 250-300km+ after which they feel flat and dead. As a uni student, I don't quite fancy my £100+ shoe investment going flat after 4 months.

Anyone know of any shoes similar in performance to either these or the previous Cumulus that have proven to last well to at least 500km? Ideally I'd like to continue using them up till 700-800 but id say 500 is decent use out of it for me. My long runs aren't super long and at absolute max id say 25 km, and I'd consider myself fairly lightweight so I haven't been looking much at the max cushion shoes as I haven't deemed them necessary.

So far the main shoes I've been looking at as alternatives to the rebel/Novablast are:
NB 880 v14
Saucony Ride 17
Brooks Ghost 15

I've been looking at previous versions as you can see just to save a buck but I don't mind going for a newer model if they're much better and I can be guaranteed it would last.

It's kinda hard to find long term reviews by shoe reviewers as they don't usually ever hit more than 100miles on any shoes due to their constant inflow of shoes. Most of the negative experiences of the Novablast/rebel I've read have been on reddit where people have actually reached that much mileage on them. I'm totally open to any suggestions from people's experience.

Backstory: I’ve been running with Mizuno Wave Riders for a long time. It’s been one of the safe models for me, accommodating my wider toes better than most shoes.

I just got their new 28 model, and have a new problem. It feels like the heel collar is digging into my ankle (lateral malleolus). This review notes a similar problem: https://www.doctorsofrunning.com/2024/07/mizuno-wave-rider-28-review-2024.html

First two runs were fine. During my third I could feel the pressure mounting. Now, a week later, I can’t even walk 100 meters in them. It’s only the left foot that hurts. (I tried running with my barefoot shoes — I don’t usually run with those — and those did not hurt at all, so it’s definitely the new shoes and not just an injury.)

Most comfortable ""inner""? 

I'm looking for something perhaps unusual. 

A shoe that is the most comfortable to leave on for 10+ hours, e.g. on a flight doing nothing. Not much walking. A bonus if it's very comfortable to walk in. 

The most comfortable I've had in this regard so far was the ASICS Nimbus 23 but this is no longer on sale. It felt very cushioned on my foot on the inside, kind of like a soft glove or sock.

I've tried Ultraboost, Allbirds, Nike pegasus, but still can't find a shoe which is simply comfortable to be in when doing nothing. E.g. a cushioned sock like feel shoe.

Appreciate all your suggestions or comments!
Best, Swoop

1k27fr6,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Mizuno Wave Rider 28 weird dent pressing on big ooe when running/walking,"Hey everyone,

I've noticed something a bit odd with my running shoes and wanted to see if anyone else has experienced this or knows if it's normal. When I'm running/walking and my weight shifts to the front of my foot, a slight dent or indentation forms in the side of the shoe right around the area of my big toe.

It's not a hard or painful pressure, but I can definitely feel it pressing lightly against my big toe, and it's a little annoying. 

My foot is rather wide, but not very high/tall in the front. Maybe that's why?

Has anyone else had this happen with their running shoes? Is this a normal flexing of the material, or could it indicate a problem with the shoe's construction or fit?
The shoes in question are a pair of Mizuno Wave Riders 28.

I've recently purchased a pair of Saucony Tempus 2's but after using them for a few weeks (about 100km) and found that I'm getting rubbing and numbness on the lateral side of my foot up to my pinky toe at about the 10k mark.

Besides this I've found that the shoes are happy to stay at a speed which makes them resistant to changing gears. On top of this they're very squeaky and pretty uncomfortable to walk in. I initially bought them with the intention of using them to be a lightweight shoe able to do up tempo workouts as well as this race.

While I'll still still use in the mean time (maybe they need more breaking in?) I'm concerned that they wont be able to handle the half marathon distance.

I overpronate which means I have used supportive shoes - mostly brooks - all my life. However recently I've found that I can get away with neutral shoes without any pain when I use my very thin (no arch support) custom orthotics which are meant to combat the overpronation.

I still think I would prefer a slightly more stable shoe as I tend to wear away at the medial wall on my shoes.

The other shoes in my rotation are:

\- Brooks Ghost 16: I've really enjoyed this shoe and this is my second pair. However I would like to move away from higher drop shoes.

\- Asics GT-1000 13: The fit of these feel really great, however I've felt they don't have enough cushion to do anything past about 12km without it feeling like I'm just slapping my feet on the ground for every step.

Based on some research I've done I was tossing up between the Brooks Hyperion Max 1 and Brooks Launch 11 (leaning towards the 11 due to the price as well as the flash v2 in the forefoot)

Other potential shoes: Hyperion 2/Max or something from the Adidas Supernova series of shoes, however I am happy to hear any other suggestions. ",2025-04-18 11:11:11+00:00,2,6
1k201hu,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Injured and need advice on these giant new shoes. Are they a gimmick?,"I don't know if this breaks the medical advice rule or not, I don't think it does...

I used to run in the military 10 years ago... Because of the military I have lots of joint pain in my legs.
Back 10 years ago, shoes were always as thin as possible. And as light as possible. The idea being you get insoles that fit your feet and just get tougher feet.

After years without ever running about 3 weeks ago I started to run again to get back into shape.
Now I'm injured already.
While running, I felt my ankle go to that gushy warm feeling, I backed off a bit, ended my run when I could. Now I woke up in the middle of the night and not only does my left ankle hurt but so does my right hip. Now I'm in bed, cannot fall asleep because every position hurts, and I'm just tired of pain anymore.
I am so tired of pain, I'm gonna give this one more try before I write off running for good.

I see that recently all these new fancy running shoes have like 2 inches of foam. Do they actually work and protect against injuries?
I don't care about speed. I don't care if my 2 mile is 10 minutes or 16minutes... I just want to be pain free.
I didn't run for roughly a decade because I'm tired of shin splints and foot pain and knee pain....
Then not working out started to catch up on me and I have realized I need to be in somewhat shape.

So I need help...
See when I used to run the hype and fad was minimalist shoes. And they SUCKED.
Now the fad is giant platform shoes... I don't want new injuries on parts of my body that don't hurt....
I see YouTube people talk about these platform shoes the same way people used to talk about the minimalist shoes... I don't want propaganda and marketing. Can someone just be frank with me?
Do these giant shoes cause new injuries?
Do they actually work?

I just want to be pain free... I don't care about muscle soreness.... soreness does not bother me. I am tired of all this joint pain and running recently has reminded me of how much I hate it.
I've been looking at Hoka Skyward X and acics Gel and new balance foam...
Price ain't an issue.
Right now I am using Nike revolution and I hate them, every step I feel the road and now I'm injured and in pain....

I am a natural heel striker, no amount of training ever fixed that... Does that effect the shoe? Does my heel strike mean no matter what shoe I use I will get injured?

I know these are basic questions. I just don't want to fork out $200 on random shoes to get new injuries that will stick with me for life, or worsen the ones I already have.
And I don't trust the YouTube people because they all lied about shoes when I used to run 10 years ago... Especially if these new shoes actually work, that would mean they 100% lied.

Do these platform shoes feel like running in sand?
Do they increase speed because now your taller and have a longer stride?
Will they protect all my injured joints without creating new injuries?
I run on roads only. I cannot run on grass or trails, that's not an option for me.
I just want to be able to run without this pain. I am so sick and tired of pain, when I was younger and in the military I could just push through it... I can't anymore, I'm old and tired and just fed-up with pain. It would just be nice to be able to run, and not be crippled in pain...
I know the difference between muscle soreness and actual pain. I aint complaining about sore muscles... 

I am 5'8"", 180lbs, and depending on the brand I wear a size 11 to 12 shoe in wide.
Do these new platform shoes like the skyward and gel actually work and prevent pain?

I've been training for my first half marathon (which is on May 4) with Novablast 5 wide. I've had peroneal tendonitis as well as a very minor case of plantar fasciitis during my training period. Initially I thought this was a result of the shoes, but I think it was probably just due to overuse, as I just completed my longest training run (and highest mileage week) with zero issues. 

So, I think the NB5 are a good fit for me in general. They're at about 230km now, and will be at around 300km on race day. I feel like they've lost a bit of bounciness and energy return, but not enough to retire them at this point. 

Now, my options are:

\- Buy another pair of NB5 now to have a fresh pair for the race

\- Buy superblasts as a small upgrade. I'm concerned about having to size up due to my wide foot. 

\- Buy some carbon plated shoe and use them for the race. Will these shoes even benefit me at my current level? Also I'd have most likely have to size up due to my wide foot

\- Race in my current shoes because the new shoe benefits may be negligible

1k1ovqn,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Legs feel dead in new shoes (Vomero 18’s),"Hello all,

For a bit of background, my previous shoes over the last few years have been On Cloudflows and Puma Velocity Nitro 2’s.

I’ve been training for the Vancouver BMO half marathon which is in a couple of weeks time and thought I’d treat myself to some new shoes ahead of that. I’ll be far from breaking any records but I’m aiming to complete the half marathon <1 hour 50 minutes.

As gigantic foam stacks seem to be all the rage I recently picked up some Nike Vomero 18’s for the last 4 weeks of training and then race day. Bought the shoes thinking I could use them as a one shoe covers all (slower paced runs, speed interval runs and a race day shoe).

Having done a few runs in the shoes (~60kms so far) I’ve totally lost my gauge of pace and for lack of a better term, my legs just feel dead while running - specifically the calf’s.

Maybe another way to put it would be that it’s like my legs aren’t getting any feedback from the shoe while running. Dunno if that makes sense.

Anyway, wondering if some of you may have experienced something similar, have some insight to this (maybe that’s just what massive foam stacks do???) or maybe I just got the wrong shoe for me.

Other shoes I’ve looked at are the Puma Deviate 3’s.",2025-04-17 21:56:49+00:00,2,9

1k1lyqa,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Choosing a daily trainer with good energy return,"I’m looking for a shoe for 5-10K towards half marathon (eventually). I currently run 5K at 5:00-5:15/km and I’m looking for something that’ll be comfortable with good energy return. I'm not sure how well to classify what good energy return is, but if it's a bit bouncier than Ultraboosts that would be a good start. 

I’ve gone back to running in ancient Ultraboosts after selling my Kayano 31s which I just didn’t get on with, they were the wrong size and the wrong shoe for me. I previously had (and returned) some GT-2000 12s which I didn’t really like the fit or feeling of either, so I’m not considering ASICS anymore.

Despite the Ultraboosts having little pronation support I’ve also had zero discomfort running in them which makes me think I don’t necessarily really need a stability shoe either. I only bought the Kayanos because the running shop I bought them from convinced me I pronated, but I'm genuinely not sure how true it is because apparently they all say that!

The problem I’m having isn’t lack of choice but almost too much choice. I just want a comfortable daily trainer with a nice energy return, not so fast or aggressive that I can’t do slower runs comfortably but still decent foam and comfort. 

My shortlist so far is:

*Saucony Ride 17* (if really discounted): Neutral with good comfort and decent midsole, some have said it’s a bit too stiff feeling but lots haven’t. Can get it for about £80-90

*Saucony Ride 18*: Lighter than 17 with even firmer midsole (according to RunRepeat measurements), about £20-40 more than 17

*Saucony Tempus 2*: Stability and bouncy Pebax midsole, glowing reviews everywhere, most expensive at £150+

*Saucony Hurricane*: Weirdly cheaper than Tempus in a few places, bulkier but more comfortable for longer runs, also supposedly better than Triumph 22 which nobody seems to like much 

*New Balance 1080v14*: Super soft and squishy, reviews say good energy return for EVA though

*Edit* - Forgot to mention the New Balance Rebel v4 also looks great, nice energy return and good comfort.

*Adidas Evo SL*: Crazy energy return, fast and light, some issues with tongue and laces

*Adidas SL2*: Not quite as good foam as Evo SL but super cheap, down to £70 in some places 

*Puma ForeverRun Nitro*: Wildcard, crazy good reviews on RunRepeat and other places, only supercritical EVA midsole but could be good. Also as cheap as £70 in some places which seems great value


Weird list, I know, but it’s really hard to know what to go for, if I should still get something with a bit of stability or not. There’s probably others that I’ve missed but I’m probably not looking at shoes with just bog-standard EVA foams, only because there’s so much competition at the £70-140 price point that you don’t really need to these days.

I’m also nervous about spending a lot on a shoe after I ended up £80 down selling my Kayanos. I know much more what to look for fit-wise this time but I’d feel stupid having the same expensive lesson twice.

If anyone has any thoughts or suggestions that could lead to me finally making a decision please let me know.",2025-04-17 19:51:01+00:00,1,10

Skechers max cushion- My first choice, felt very nice like walking on a cloud, I’m realising all new shoes have a lot of foam these days. Bought size 10 uk they felt tight and constrictive especially in the toe box leading to pain . Retuned them they didnt have 10.5 , tried 11 but even that didn’t feel comfy enough in the toe box. 

New balance 880 v15- These felt the most perfect size wise, I tried a 10.5 uk and it worked well as I believe the nb shoes have a wider toebox area in comparison to other brands. My only gripe was walking around wearing them in the store felt a bit wired as I’m not used to all this extra elevation and foam felt a bit strange not in a negative way but I was unsure if I would get used to them . Particularly the upper sole are right below toes felt had some even extra padding elevation which felt new and something that I’m not used to? 

Adidas duramo speed 2 - These are the ones I finally picked up. Felt comfy and has a regular amount of foam or elevation that I’m used to. The only issue is these are a size 11uk and not 10.5 that I usually wear. They feel a tad loose however the runners knot sorts heel lift issues and the toe box area extra space def feels great. Just im not sure if 10.5 would have been a better fit though if happy atleast with the half size up I won’t face any pain issues like I did with previous pairs . 


In hindsight I’m just thinking whether the better fitting NB 880s were a better choice and that perhaps I’d get used to the shoes?. Secondly feel I should have tried on the 10.5uk in the adidas just to compare with the uk 11s. ",2025-04-17 15:31:14+00:00,0,23

1k17g4k,AskRunningShoeGeeks,"Anything better than Asics Gel Kayano for me - medium distance, some knee pain if I run too much, wonky ankle from accident?","*TL:DR;*

Currently using Gel Kayano 28 in UK10/EU45 which I got 3 years ago, I've always used Gel Kayano's for road running; the one time I tried something else I got hip pain.

I'm  wondering if I should replace with a newer Gel Kayano or if there's anything better, ideally that might help knee pain which can come from all types of exercise or strains a few days after normally, but I appreciate there's unlikely to be shoes which are a magic bullet as it's not running specific.

Details;

Mid 40s guy in the UK, 6'/182cm about 75kg/165lb 

Fairly open budget, I normally try and get a deal on last year's model, but open to buy the latest too.

Daily trainer for road use, I have a trail trainer.

My left foot is around 27cm/10cm and my right foot is around 26cm/10cm, previously broke/smashed up tib and fib on right leg up and it's all a bit off.   It feels like since I lost weight my feet have lost 'volume' too - I've had struggles getting walking boots and skates that fit, but more flexible footwear is generally okay.  (I have been up to about 105kg/230lb at my worst, but used to hover around 90kg/200lb)

*Background;*

In 2009 I went to a running shop and had the gait analysis etc done; they suggested Asics Gel Kayano in a 10. I was suspicious that it was just one of the most expensive shoes in the shop at the time. I could see that while my left foot ran fairly normally, my right foot was all over the place from where I badly broke my lower leg a few years before, they suggested a shoe for overpronation on this basis.

I only did some bits of running on a treadmill then, but in 2012 to early 2014 did quite a lot of road running  . At one point I tried some other shoes as my Kayano's were pretty worn, got some hip pain which cleared up when I wet back to my old tired Kayano's. I've stuck with that model since. I typically run 8k to 15k, but can be 4k to 42k (thinking about a casual marathon soon, longest I've run otherwise is a 21k on road, 24k trail).

Had a bit of a rest in 2014 after an ultra, still cycled a lot, got back into it late 2014 doing 3 runs that first week, then cycling home from work suddenly got some knee pain. That's been around since, but has got better. if I use my legs too much it will come back as a dull ache, normally a few days after the exercise, but can be during if it's already bad. In the past it's actually seemed to be worse cycling and using the heavy clutch in my van, than running but can definitely come back from running too, so I normally limit myself to one run a week.

I'm wondering if there's another shoe I should try/consider, especially if that might reduce the chances of knee pain. Happy enough to stick with Kayano if they are a good choice too",2025-04-17 08:00:06+00:00,2,10

I have Vaporfly 3’s, which I absolutely loved for my 5k PB a few months ago. However, in one of my longer marathon training runs, they really beat my legs up. To be fair, I think they were too tight and I don’t think they were good during the easy sections of the long run. 

I then used them for my half marathon PB a few weeks ago and got the time I wanted (sub 1:30), but my calves were dead for days after. This could be due to neglecting strength training a bit, so I have tried to incorporate calf raises etc. 

I’m doing the London marathon next week and I’m concerned they’re not going to be comfortable in the latter stages of the race. In contrast, I wore my EVO SL’s in my final long run this weekend and my legs have recovered so well. This was 32k with 12km of marathon pace. Am I overthinking? Does anyone have recommendations for carbon plated running shoes that are more comfortable than Vaporfly’s and are maybe similar to the EVO SL’s? It’s probably too late, but if I did get shoes, I could test them out this week although I don’t have any big marathon sessions left. 

For reference, I believe I’m a mid-forefoot striker (need to get this checked really) and I over pronate a bit. Another shoe I’ve loved during training is the Brooks Glycerin Max.  ",2025-04-16 07:51:52+00:00,2,13

I’ve only logged about 88 kilometers in mine in the last two months, and I’m already noticing a significant loss in responsiveness and a visibly compressed midsole — especially around the forefoot and inner side.

For context:

* I’m a 74–76 kg male
* I run mostly on roads/sidewalks on dry days (I switch to GTX shoes when it rains)
* My average pace is between 5:45 and 6:45 min/km, tracked with Garmin + HRM Pro Plus
* I rotate my shoes fair bit (among 4\~5 pairs in a given week), and take decent care of them

The outsole wear is minimal, but the midsole already feels flat and unresponsive — like the energy return is completely gone. I’ve submitted a warranty claim with ASICS (purchased through their official Amazon store), but I’m wondering if this is a one-off issue or if others are seeing the same thing.

Would love to hear if anyone else has experienced premature wear with the NB5 — or if yours are holding up well. Also curious how the warranty process went for others.",2025-04-16 03:33:27+00:00,28,48

Was hoping my old daily trainers could just carry me over the finish line (pun intended) but my last 2 long runs in them have left my lower legs achy and sore. They have over 400 miles on them already, with their outsoles around midfoot pretty flat. So my options are:

1. Race in tempo shoes. I have a pair of Saucony Endorphin Speed 4s. Only worn them to 3 workouts. Never run more than 8, 9 miles in them. Should I do my next long runs in these and race in them?
2. Race in a new pair of daily trainers(Saucony Ride 17). I've started breaking these in and will continue to do all my easy runs in them. Should I do my next long runs in the new trainers, and race in these in stead?

I guess by the end of the day I don't know if racing in Endorphin Speed 4s is a good idea. They are the first pair of not-your-average-daily-trainers shoes I've ever had. I don't know if they'll get me injured in longer distances.

I’ve recently been getting foot pain running in a new pair of Hoka Skyward X, which I got hoping for more cushioning and comfort. But oddly, they’re causing me a lot of discomfort.

For context, I’ve done most of my running in Adidas Adios Pro 3s—no pain there, but they’re too pricey to use for all my training. I’ve also tried ASICS Kayano 30s, Adidas Boston 12s, and Saucony Speed 4s over the past few years, and all of those gave me pretty bad foot pain too.

Interestingly, a gifted pair of ASICS Metaspeed Sky also worked really well for me—no issues there either.

What could be going on here? Why do soft/max-cushion trainers seem to hurt more than carbon shoes, which are supposedly harsher on your feet?

I’m a 6ft, 200lb runner doing ~5:20/km pace, mostly training for half marathons if that helps.

Any insights or similar experiences would be appreciated!

1jzp7sc,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Running Shoe Rotation,"Seeking advice, opinions, and/or comments on building a 2-3 shoe rotation. I’m currently running in Hoka Clifton 9s, Brooks Launch GTS 9, and Saucony Endorphin Speed 4. Clifton’s are for long/easy runs, Brooks are everyday trainers, Endorphin 4s are for workouts/races. These have worked well for me, but I’m wondering if there’s a more “optimized” rotation than my current setup. 

For background, I’m 28M running for 10+ years. However, I’m not well versed on shoe selection or pronation considerations. From what I can tell I’m a midfoot striker and have a slightly bigger frame (5’11” and ~175lbs) compared to the average distance runner. I run primarily on paved routes but sometimes do long runs on trails/bike paths. I’m in the process of building up to ~40-50miles/week. Currently doing ~25/week. 

I’ve trialed different shoe types and brands with mixed results. For example I loved the Hoka Arahi 6’s. I bought the Arahi 7’s as replacements but they felt dramatically different. The 7’s were too firm and unresponsive. It felt like I had bricks on my feet. I was also not a fan of the OnCloud Monster or Adizero Boston 10s. Years ago I LOVED the NB Zante fresh foams. Not sure if those or something similar are around. 

I’m down for trying new shoes but I’m also content with continuing my current rotation if it’s a decent spread. Sorry if this has been asked before and thanks in advance!!",2025-04-15 11:13:59+00:00,0,3

I’m training for a half marathon over the next few months and I’m thinking of getting a new pair of running shoes at some point during the training block. I currently rotate between two pairs:

* **Asics Gel Nimbus 26**: I use these for all my easy runs and long runs. They're super, super comfortable, and I love them for recovery days. However, they feel a bit too heavy when I try to pick up the pace.
* **Puma Deviate Nitro 3**: I use these for speed workouts, tempos, and races. They feel much lighter and more responsive, but they’ve been giving me blisters and a black toenail on my right foot. I can tolerate them for a 10K, but I don’t think I could run a half marathon in them without discomfort...

For some reason I’ve been experiencing a good amount of medial knee pain which is something I’ve never dealt with before. I played soccer for 16 years, a bit of track + field and plenty of weight lifting and I’ve never had a problem with my knees. 

I started running about a month ago, mostly to improve CV health and not really focusing much on distance, but I was typically running between 1.0-1.5 miles depending on speed and/elevation. My watch tells me the incline is about a 251’ spread from beginning to end of the run.

I’ve never paid much attention to the type of running shoe. I’ve had a few pair of free runs that I admittedly retired too late each time, but it’s been a very long time since I’ve ran in those shoes. I recently bought Brooks Revel 5s and I’m unsure if the knee pain is coming from these or not. 

I’m currently rowing and squatting with zero pain.

I’ve been a casual runner most my life, but last year was the first time I really took running seriously. I completed my first half marathon, but during that training cycle, I started experiencing a sharp, radiating pain in my feet about a mile into my runs. It felt like my muscles in my feet were getting mangled. But If I just kept running, the pain would usually go away by mile 3, or at least become tolerable.

At the time, I was running in the Nike Pegasus 39. Someone suggested my foot muscles were weak and recommended I try the Nike Free Run 5.0 for a more “natural” feel. That just made everything worse. I’ve also tried the Nike Invincible 2, but they felt unstable and wobbly for me. Eventually, I saw a podiatrist, got put on anti-inflammatories (BIG MISTAKE), and started PT.

When PT didn’t help much, we did an X-ray & MRI and it turned out I was close to developing stress fractures in both of my calcaneuses which I assume was because I was heel striking the whole time I was running and when on anti-inflammatories I was only pushing harder which made it way worse in the long run.

Since then, I’ve worked hard on improving my form (video in post is my new form early on) and increasing my cadence, which was super low back when I was heel striking.

Now I’m training for my first full marathon (195 days out) and currently running in: •	Nike Vaporfly 2 – favorite shoe I’ve ever run in •	Nike Pegasus Turbo Next Nature – I use these for easier runs

I am retiring my triumph 17 after 600km (9,5US, wide/2E). I was running without the ""formfit"" insole and just kept the thin yellow insole below it. They fit perfectly.

After reading many good reviews I would like to try the endorphin speed for my tempo run (the triumph were feeling a bit too ""dead"" and not really funny, not really reactive when faster than 5:00 per km)

I went to the store to try the endorphin speed 4, but even half size up (10US) they felt too tight in the mid foot section.  
I heard the speed 3 offer a roomier experience and find plenty of size available on Novelship.

1jz2lru,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Anyone else experience one foot riding the edge of a shoe?,"After getting the Topo Phantom 3 for walking in, I thought I had finally found a shoe brand that fit my very wide forefoot. So I ordered their Atmos (final sale) but am experiencing a problem I've never had before.

While both Topos seem to have very aggressive arch support, when I wear the Atmos the big toe joint on my right foot lands on the edge of the midsole, giving me a blister but also making me run weird because the foam isn't compressing evenly along the length of my foot.

  
The difference in where my big toes impact is pretty obvious in the picture I think (the extra compression and flaking of the white paint). It's like my foot is crooked inside the shoe, except my heel feels like it's right where it should be. The shoes are not slipping at all when I run, and my foot takes up the full width so it's not moving around laterally.

I've tried different socks, different lacing techniques, bunion pads (ironically, it's my other foot that actually has a bunion), anything to try and get my forefoot pushed over to the centre of the midsole where it's supposed to be. So far nothing has worked.

Anybody else have experience or advice for this?",2025-04-14 16:06:06+00:00,2,4

1jz0hii,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Shoe size advice: Adidas Adios Pro 4,"I feel like I'm between sizes on these. Please can I get a second pair of eyes/another opinion?

I'm normally a UK8.5, the smaller of these two shoes.

The UK9 feels a bit more accommodating but (as mentioned on a past post) but feels less ideal underfoot, in terms of where I'm hitting rods. That said, that was only a tear running about 30m back and forth inside a large sports shop, so not exactly that useful.

To make my mind up I mail-ordered both sizes with the intent of returning one. There isn't a 'try on the road before you buy' type program in my country, so I need to make this decision on the basis of fit/feel.

The smaller size has my foot feeling a bit 'bound', the big toe being pushed across into the midline a touch. I've had worse but it isn't a shoe I can splay in.

The larger size - the space doesn't excessive. I have about half a thumbs clearance for four of my toes, with a whole thumb clearance for my big toe. The upper holds my foot. Maybe a touch more heel slip in the larger size but far from my worst shoe for it.

I've attached images of both for context. The first image is the UK9.

Thanks in advance for advice!

(Aside: I'm a UK8.5 in ASICS, which more closely matches the UK9 EU sizing in the ADIDAS if that's any help? I enjoy how that shoe fits - it's more akin to the UK9 Adidas in terms of width, albeit with a tiny bit less length?)",2025-04-14 14:39:36+00:00,7,7

1jyxepw,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Should I replace SuperBlast 2's?,"Hi,

I'm a very new runner. Have been building up cardio for the past 4 months towards a goal of running a 5k at <10min/mi in early May. I have never really run consistently before and never done a race of any kind.

About me:

* 39 year old male
* 6'1""
* 180lbs
* Very tight hamstrings, calves, hips. This is due to mild cerebral palsy from my torso down. I appear able bodied, but am so tight I will never be able to bend over and touch my toes.
* History of some back instability / spasms. I have found this tends to be exacerbated by 'soft' shoes and lower body tightness.

Question: Do you recommend I change shoes? If so, what would you recommend I try?

Context: I went to a specialty running store near me in Greenwich, CT. They recommended SuperBlast 2s, or a pair of Hoka's that I can't remember off the top of my head (maybe Mach?). I chose the SB 2's because I liked how firm/stable they are, thinking it would be better for my back stability. However, I didn't like their stack height, or at least found it more jarring the the Hoka's, having never worn a modern running shoe before.

Since beginning to run with them, I have noticed pain in my arches and some hotspots on the outside of my forefoot. This may be more common with the Balega socks they gave me than the regular Nike everyday + socks I wear most runs.

More recently, I suffered a calf injury during a training run on a treadmill. I'm hopeful it's mild, but renewed my concern that the shoes are not great for me.

Curious to hear what you more experienced folks think! Thanks!",2025-04-14 12:16:58+00:00,5,9
1jyuwde,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Looking for shoes to replace Mach 5s,"So I have recently changed my daily shoes from Clifton 9s to the Novablst 5s and I'm really enjoying them so much more than the Cliftons - more than I thought I would! I was rotating between the Cliftons and Mach 5s only really running between 5k-10k. My Mach 5s are sadly coming to their end so I will be looking to replace them in the next month or so. My first thought was to go straight to the mach 6 but since moving away from Hoka for my dailys I'm thinking there might be a better speedy shoe out there for me! I am also running a 1/2 marathon in September which I haven't done for a few years so looking for something I could potentially use for the 1/2 although I would be perfectly happy doing it in the NB5s as my last 1/2 since my last 1/2 was in a pair of Asics.

My thoughts are the following based on what I've seen in this thread:

* Mach 6 - already sort of used to Hoka but don't know how they compare to the 5s
* Endorphin speed 4 - pricier but supposed to be nice and speedy, however I'm worried about them being too stiff as I have never got on with carbon plated shoes, however I have never used a nylon plate
* Rebel V4s - lightweight and can get them on sale quite easily but seen mixed reviews about their responsiveness
* Evo SL - have heard so many good things about them on here, inexpensive compared to some other options but have also heard people say they wouldn't run a 1/2 in them

Would love to hear from anyone who owns/has tried these shoes and can offer a bit of a comparison to help me decide!

Does anybody have an experience with the sizing on both the EVOs and the AP4? I seem to have read a few issues about the AP4 coming up slightly small? I would order both sizes but with the higher cost I can't afford to be ordering £450 worth of trainers.

I’ve been running with whatever running shoes I had previously but enough time has passed where I’m looking into actual running shoes even if I keep telling myself I’m just a hobby jogger, I felt shin splints coming on when I was running 7 days consecutively.

I didn't have any decent sneakers to run in (had to run in my converse for a little while) so I got the Reebok Women's Energen Lux as I found them on a really good sale and wanted to make sure I enjoyed running races before I bought 'fancy' shoes.

I've started to enjoy running more than I thought I would and am looking for a new pair of shoes. My feet pronate a bit so the shoes at the store that were recommended to me were stability shoes. Out of all of them my two favorites were the Hoka Arahi 7 and the New Balance Fresh Foam X 860v14. They were different enough that I wasn't entirely sure which I liked better and I'm not sure which to choose.

I'm also trying to start rotating my shoes so I don't use them up quite as quickly. I like the Reeboks and they're fine to run in but the NB and Hokas were significantly more comfortable for sure. Within the next year the goal is to run a sub-25 5k and to run a 10k. Maybe a half marathon eventually if I get inspired. I read through the FAQs on this page and asked a friend who runs marathons but I'm still a bit confused on what shoes I'm supposed to use for what runs and why.

He loves amusement parks but the past trip ended up  with blisters from the hokas on the arch and toes.

1jxqczt,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Brooks Magic Fit,"Brooks have consistently fit me better than anything else. I was gifted the Beast 20s a while back when I was over 300 pounds and on my feet all day, and they were the first shoes that actually felt good, so much so that I bought 2 more pairs and wore only those for 2 years. I was disappointed when they stopped selling the Beasts so I went to fleet feet to be fitted for shoes and discover what all was out there. I wear a size 13 and they said my width was E, so kind of between regular and wide (they also said I don’t need  stability shoes). I walked out that day with some NB 860v14 that are great, but I’m still looking for more.

Now, most shoes I’ve tried tend to feel extremely tight across the top of my foot, especially in the upper part where the tongue is. The Saucony Hurricane 24, Triumph 22, and Ride 18 were all way too tight in the upper. Every Nike I tried just didn’t work for me, the fit was awful in pretty much every way. On shoes didn’t work for me either. They didn’t fit well and just didn’t feel right at all.

ASICS has been the only other brand that’s come close. The Novablast 5 fit great and the upper was amazing, but they made me feel super unstable, like I didn’t even know how to walk. The Gel Nimbus 27 fit really well and might be one of my next pairs.

Even though Brooks shoes tend to fit me better than anything else, not all of them have worked out. I tried the Glycerin Max and it felt a lot like the 1080v14. My heels felt like they were sinking and I just couldn’t get used to that feeling. I also tried the Adrenalines but they were too firm for my liking. The Ghost Max 2 felt weird in the toe box, like there was a drop that made walking awkward.

I haven’t gotten around to trying Hokas yet, so I’m still holding out for those. Right now the only shoes I actually wear are the NB 860v14 and the Brooks Ghost 16, which honestly blew me away.

I’m planning to get the Glycerin 22/Stealthfit. I tried them today and liked them more than anything I currently own. I’m also probably going to grab the ASICS Gel Nimbus 27.

Hey what's up, I recently got some orthotics to combat a hip thing that led to knee pain, was entirely pain-free and functioning. Then I decided to get some metaspeed sky paris (had been running in superblast 2 and nb sc trainer 2) and it immediately felt like something wasn't right.

Didn't cause me any pain, but now I am noticing said overpronation in all of my shoes and my lower legs are sore after every run.

Has anyone experienced something similar?

Not sure how to proceed as I am training for a race. Maybe my feet and legs are gonna adapt, I can stop the overpronation if I focus on it...

Novablast 5s also look good but I'm concerned with their durability. I see some reviews of the Rides and also Triumphs having good durability, so they seem like a good option. Also it looks like the Ride 18 is pretty similar to older Triumph models which were super popular. I tried the Triumph 21 (or 20) on in-store and liked them, just ended up going with NB 1080v13s instead and found those a little too soft (and not durable) over time. Adidas SL2 also seems like a good option, and maybe Nike Pegasus 41. I still use the NB 1080s for slow runs sometimes but they're definitely on their last legs, and I only have around 250 miles in them



The Rides seem like a good balance of softness without being too soft, but I was curious what others (especially heavier runners) think of them.",2025-04-12 17:33:36+00:00,2,8
1jxi5m1,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Recommendations for everyday long run / walk please 🇬🇧,"👋🏼 

I’m looking for shoe recommendations for daily long walking/running and could use your expertise! I’ve only ever used cheap, random shoes from places like M&S or H&M, but I’m ready to invest in proper footwear. I have two scenarios (for me and someone else) with similar needs but different weights. Details below:

#1 
Purpose: Walking/running 6 miles/day, 5 days/week on roads.
- Foot type: Normal foot, overpronates.
- Current issues: Foot burn after long use, some knee pain with current shoes.
- Weight: normal.
- Experience: No experience with proper running shoes.

#2
- Same purpose and conditions as above (6 miles/day, 5 days/week on roads).
- Foot type: Normal foot, overpronates.
- Current issues: Foot burn, knee pain with current shoes.
- Weight: obese.
- Experience: Also no experience with proper running shoes.

I’d love suggestions for shoes that could help with comfort, support for overpronation, and durability for this mileage. Any brands or models you recommend? Also, any tips for transitioning from cheap shoes to better ones? Budget isn’t set yet, but I’m open to options. Thanks in advance!

ps - I did my own research and gathered few options but it will be really helpful to hear geeks’ opinion 🙏

1jxaxhg,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Shoe Rotation Recommendation for HM Training,"Hey guys, this may be a long post, but as the title describes, I'm looking for a proper daily trainer I could use for my half-marathon training. Right now, I've been rocking the Boston 12 for my threshold workouts and my HM pace long runs, and I feel no pain afterward.

That being said, on my easier runs, they definitely feel more clunky. Here's some criteria I have, and shoes I've tried in the past that have NOT worked for me at all:

\- I currently run a roughly 8:25-8:30 mile pace for my HM and definitely feel the lightstrike pro working at such paces and lower, but beyond 9 and I start to feel the weight of the shoe a lot more

\- I tend to run a midfoot strike, but notice some heel wear on my shoes too, especially during runs past 2 hours

\- I'm a pretty skinny guy (roughly 5' 7, 115 lbs), and do not at all enjoy the feel of max stack or chunky shoes (have tried Hoka Bondi's, Cliftons, and Triumph 20 before)

\- I would like something that is more cushioned and responsive for both short and longer distances. I've tried the Brooks Ghost 16s before, and work great for under 10k, but feel like complete bricks after that point.

\- I occasionally run on mild trails (think California cross country), and would like something durable for such terrain

\- I have tried shoes with 10 mm heel drop (triumph 20), and notice a vast difference in my strike (more emphasis on my heel), and do not enjoy the feel unlike my bostons (7 mm)

Another thing I wanted to know was whether a carbon plated shoe would be ideal for my current half marathon pace? Moreso, if I ran with a dedicated race day shoe, would I be able to truly harvest its capabilities? And if so, what shoe would you recommend I pair with my bostons? I have heard good things about the AP3s, but I'm not sure if it is firmer than the bostons, and don't know if I would like the feel of it. I have used the endorphin speed 2s to the end of its life and definitely enjoyed them for my race days, but the speed/pro series has undergone massive changes and am not sure if the feel is the same anymore.

Again, sorry for the long post, but I seriously would appreciate any suggestions you guys have, and any deals you could find for those recommendations 🙏🏽.",2025-04-12 06:24:21+00:00,2,2
1jx9sk4,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Do I really need rotation shoes? Puma ForeverRun feels off,"Hey everyone,
I’ve been running consistently since December, averaging 50–70 km per month at a pace of around 7:00/km. I’m training for my first 10K race, doing ~6 km runs on 2x weekdays and 10 km long runs on weekends.

I got a pair of Puma ForeverRun Nitro Knit in late December — they’re my only running shoes and have about 200 km on them now. Lately, I’ve noticed the midsole feels a bit weird in the first few kilometers, and the shoes feel really stiff halfway through my runs. I don’t get much bounce, and my knees have started to feel.

I used to run on a track, but now I’m doing all my runs on the road — not sure if that’s adding to the impact.

Since I’m still a beginner, I made the classic mistake of not having a shoe rotation. The Pumas should still be fairly new at just 200 km, so I’m a bit puzzled by how they’re already feeling off. I’m also starting to consider training for a half marathon, so I think it might be time to look into a second pair — ideally something with more cushioning and bounce for longer road runs.

Am I overthinking this?

TL;DR: Beginner runner (7:00/km pace), training for a 10K. Using Puma ForeverRun Knit (200 km in), now feeling stiff mid-run and knees are sore — especially after switching from track to road.

I'm also open to other shoes from other brands, however I'd rather not spend above 180 USD on a training shoe. Also, I'm not willing to spend money on brooks since I've gotten 2 stress reactions in their shoes + they donated to the trump regime.

1jx2srq,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Faster shoes when?,"When to transition to faster shoes?

Hello everyone! 51M. 5’9” 182lbs. I ride road bikes but for this for this purpose I’m not going to transfer any “fitness” from riding bicycles to running.

As I start my beginner journey to walk then to run, I want to ask what was your personal milestone when you knew you had to transition to faster shoes?

I’ve picked up discounted models of the Clifton 9 and Endorphin Shift to start. In my low experience, they both seem find to me. I feel the Endorphin is faster than the Clifton only because the Clifton feels softer. 

I’m not technical at all. I have a rudimentary system to gauge if I’m getting better (did I get to the same stoplight at a faster time, do my legs or feet feel better today than yesterday, etc.)

I’m doing this for a purely health/mental/fitness standpoint. 

So what’s the most basic way to tell if I should upgrade to faster shoes?

Thank you!

Edit: To be more inline with this sub’s purpose, please recommend which shoes to upgrade if/when I’m ready. Thank you again!",2025-04-11 22:44:07+00:00,0,12

1jx1e2z,AskRunningShoeGeeks,"Best marathon shoe for hip pain, soft vs firm cushion","Hey folks was hoping for some advice. 

  
This year is my first marathon.

But about me

Experienced runner 

1.73cm 

Male 

Neutral runner 

70kg

  
I have been using the Novablast 4 for the last couple of months to build up the mileage. I do like the firmer feel to them vs the likes of the NB More V4 and have used the Puma Velocity Nitro previously. 

  
However I have been suffering from extensive glute and hip pain over the last few months whilst training and wondering is it the bounce in the shoes themselves that may be causing the stability to be a bit off? 

So question here, if you suffer from  weak hip or glute strength is it better to opt for a max cushion neutral shoe with a softer foam or a more hard cushioned foam? Granted I know that I need to work on strengthening these areas regardless but just wanted to see if anyone had any issues with the Novablast 4 in this regard? I didn't have the same problems with the Velocity Nitro but was also told that the max cushion would be less tiring on the legs as a result, but now the hips are taking the brunt of it. 

  
Any advice would be greatly appreciated

I’m training for my first half marathon and have been running in Altra Escalantes. I decided to try out something with a little more cushion. I’m probably going to try one more shoe before I completely give up and stick with the Escalantes, but is there any recommendation for what shoes to try next?

First I tried the asics Novablast, but felt the cushion was too aggressive and oddly concentrated against the balls of my feet. I’ve seen reviews that lighter runners might experience this. I tried the gel nimbus in store and it felt like I was fighting against the cushion with each step. 

Bought the brooks glycerin 22 a few days ago but I had to quit my run early because it gave me shin splints pretty quickly. It feels like the inside of the ball of those shoes have a bit more cushion than the outside..

1jwuchl,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Beginner with high arches – stuck between Puma Velocity Nitro 3 vs Salomon Ultra Flow,"Hey folks,

I’m a beginner runner and recently started running using my old Adidas Ultraboost 22s. Unfortunately, I’ve been dealing with heel pain, joint pain, and shin splints, which made me think it’s time for a proper running shoe.

I have high arches and a neutral pronation, and I’m looking for a shoe that offers good comfort and support, mainly for road running. Trail running might happen occasionally, maybe some light hikes too, but that’s not the main focus.

After trying on a few, I’ve narrowed it down to two shoes:
	•	Puma Velocity Nitro 3 – Feels sporty, responsive, and lightweight. It’s a road running shoe. However, it’s a bit snug in the toe box, though not painfully tight.
	•	Salomon Ultra Flow – More relaxed fit, enough space for my toes to move around, and felt more cushioned right out of the box. It’s a road-to-trail shoe, but I’ll mostly use it on pavement.

I can get both at a discount:
	•	Salomon for €63
	•	Puma for €73

Which one would you recommend for my situation? I’m mainly looking for comfort and injury prevention as I build my mileage. Thanks in advance!

How do you do meaningful comparisons without spending a ton of money and risking injury?,"I've been running on Nike Pegasus shoes for years. They've generally had what I like: notable squishiness in the mid/forefoot to protect my knees, nothing that digs into my flat feet, and reasonable prices when on sale.

But I let a pair go too long and had to replace quickly a month-ish ago and nothing was on sale, so I bought three pairs on Amazon. New Balance Fresh Foam 880, Saucony Tempus, Saucony Triumph 21. The NBs felt the best, so I kept them and started running with them. But (possibly?) because of the 2mm shorter heel drop or perhaps their overall squishiness (or perhaps simply running in my late 30s), I tweaked my Achilles. So I went out and found a cheap pair of Peg 41s and...they feel pretty different than older models?

Anyways, I'm managing a minor (for now) PTTD issue, and I want to experiment. But ""experiment"" seems to mean ""spend $100 minimum on shoes that you can't meaningfully try without making them nonreturnable"".

So how do yinz do it? Are you just spending hundreds-to-thousands on shoes and putting dozens-to-hundreds of miles on each to see how they feel? To what extent is your earned experience transferable to anyone else?",2025-04-11 13:46:36+00:00,6,14

I’m currently a bit overwhelmed with choosing my next running shoe and could use some advice. I was planning to check out some local stores, but many of the models I’m interested in seem to be sold out offline.

I’m looking to replace my **Asics GT-2000** and **Gel Kayano 31**. I used both during marathon training last year (which I completed in October), but they’re now close to the end of their lifecycle.

Since then, I’ve:

* Lost about 8 kg
* Gained back muscle in my legs
* Improved my running speed quite a bit

Because of these changes, I feel like I don’t need bulky, heavily cushioned stability shoes anymore. I also wear **custom inlays**, so I don’t require a stability model either.

**My current running stats:**

* **Height:** 1.80 m
* **Weight:** 82 kg
* **Foot type:** Medium width, flat arches
* **Long run pace:** \~5:30 to 6:10 min/km
* **Tempo runs:** Down to 4:15 min/km

I’m currently training to **cut my half marathon time down to 1:45**, so I’m looking for a shoe that can support consistent training while still being fun and responsive.

For tempo work, I run in the **Saucony Kinvara 14** (and love it). Now I’m looking for something a bit more versatile or daily-trainer oriented.

**Shoes I'm considering:**

* **Asics Novablast 4**
* **Asics Superblast 2**
* **Saucony Ride 17**
* **Brooks (not sure which model yet – open to suggestions)**

Would love to hear your experiences with these or get other recommendations based on my profile. Thanks a lot in advance!",2025-04-11 11:24:04+00:00,6,3

Nimbus 26 - will probably have to go a full size larger to accomodate for width.  
Asics Winflo 11 (since they have an extra wide option so this would probably be the best fitting one)  
Asics Gt-2000 12 (Since this has some really positive feed back) 

Skechers Go Run Pure 4 - like the arch fit, it was different. dont know if thats gonna be a good experience though  
unfortunately it seems to be a new model and there isnt much info on this on the internet.  
  
these are all about 80$ now for me so within my budget. But considering how the Nimbus 27 didnt feel wide enough for my feet at the correct length, I might have to ditch Asics altogether or go with the Kayano. Anyone know if the Gt 2000 12 is wide shoe or not?

Hi, first time poster here. I read through the FAQs and didn't see a variation of this question so please forgive me if I'm being redundant.

I've been a casual runner for about 5 years and have started running 10ks and halfs in the last two. Brooks Ghost have been my go-to for the majority of my time running (one reason being their double wide offerings), but I've been disappointed with my last several pairs. I don't know when it happened, but at some point they started adding this semi -rigid material to the toe box that indents and craters, eventually leading to a constant feeling of a small rock rubbing against my toes.

Does anybody have any recommendations for a comprable shoe without a denty to box? I'm asking because I will likely have to order them online as there is only an Academy and one running shoe store in my area and the pickings are slim, and I would prefer to minimize returns/exchanges through the mail if I can.

1jw7pjn,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Replacement laces for the Adidas Adizero line?,"**TL;DR For Adidas Adizero, Lock Laces or Vaporfly knockoffs?**

I am a fan of Lock Laces, which I currently have on my Boston 12s. Use them with other shoes mainly for fit and convenience, but it is almost a necessity with the Bostons.

Picked up in the past few months both Pro 3s and the Prime Strung 2 (great deals). Have not had lacing issues as with the Bostons, but would definitely like to change them. The laces on the Pro 3s are not quite long enough for a runners knot. Have only used them for tempo runs, just over 10k. The PS2 were used for longer easier runs. Does Adidas provide the same lace length for all sizes? I wear size 12/12.5 and there is simply not enough.

I like Lock Laces and buy them in 2-3 packs, so I have a couple more to use. My only dislike is that you really cannot do a runners loops with them. The alternative would be something like UamGlsob laces, which are Alpha/Vaporfly knockoffs. I am in between sizes and always buy longer. The Pro 3s are on the shorter size since I will only use them for HMs, making a runners loops more important. My tempo runs in them are great. Not to concerned about the PS2 since I will not race in them, but they do have short laces.

My other concern is ""nothing new on race day"". My HM race is next weekend and I am not expecting to do any runs in the P3s. Tempo run will be in the Bostons. Can I get a good fit with a simple 5k easy run?

After this race I want to experiment with window lacing since I have high arches. I believe it would benefit me.",2025-04-10 20:19:45+00:00,3,2

1jw6x5c,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Lifestyle Shoe Suggestions,"Hi,

I know this is a running-centric sub, but I'm hoping you all have some advice for me!

I'm coming off of ultraboosts after ~5 years and am looking to see what's better out there.

My primary criteria are breathability (dont like stinky shoes/socks), comfort (easy to put on, somewhat stretchy, etc.), and style (will wear almost every day, so likely triple black just so it fits daily life and in-office work).

Activities: Everyday standing/walking, standard gym use (elliptical).

I know there have been posts in the past, but its nice to get some fresh recommendations. Some of what I'm currently looking into but am not beholden to are:

Hoka Clifton (Heard a lot of good things about comfort and breathability, but not sold on the style)
Asics Nimbus
Nike Invincible

Somewhat considering Saucony options as well.

If anyone has experience or a  recommendation for my usage, that would be hugely appreciated!",2025-04-10 19:47:40+00:00,2,18
1jw6n1k,AskRunningShoeGeeks,which daily to complete my rotation (Nimbus 26 & ES4),"My current rotation:  



speedy: ES4 recovery: Nimbus 26 daily/interval: 880 v13  



Me: 6'0 (1,83) 200 pounds (90kg), slow neutral mid-foot striker  



I am having a good time with the nimbus as long as I don't pick up the pace, the fit is perfect and it's really comfy. the ES4 opened up a new world for me, what a wonderful shoe, these are exactly what work for me, shaved a minute per km off my speeds. I had Boston 12's before them and returned them because I couldn't get them to fit right even though the runs were good. the middle of my foot and the top of my arches hurt or when I sized up my heels would slip even with runners knot which would choke off my foot even.  

My daily trainers now are 880v13's which do the job but the low toe box and the seam of the tongue bother me somewhat. Also my big toe sometimes scrapes the top of the toe box. I want to replace them. I will be running a lot at high temperatures so breathability is important to me. Also after the Boston 12's I learned heel comfort is important to me too, or maybe the long nature of the bostons caused that.  



Which daily would you recommend me?",2025-04-10 19:35:53+00:00,1,5
1jw6e3y,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Heavy heel striker looking for first race shoe (half/full marathon),"Hey everyone,

I’m looking for help finding the ideal race day shoe for my upcoming half marathon (6 weeks away) and future marathon (possibly later this year). I’ll keep this short but with all the relevant info:

---

**About Me:**

- Male runner, ~88 kg (194 lbs)  
- Heel striker with mild stability needs  
- Cadence: ~160 on easy runs, ~165-170 at race pace  
- Race pace goal for HM: **5:00/km** (~8:03/mi) to break **1:45:00** in the half  
- Goal for marathon: finish and have fun without too much foot pain, perhaps shoot for sub 4h
- Weekly mileage: ~45–60km  

---

**Current Rotation:**

- **Daily/long runs:** *Puma MagMax*
- **Speed/intervals:** *Adizero Evo SL*  
- **Retiring:** *New Balance 1080v13* – felt perhaps a bit too soft and squishy for me  

---

**What I’m Looking for in a Race Shoe:**

- Suitable for half and full marathon
- Responsive enough for 5:00/km pace  
- Stable enough for a heavier heel striker  
- Carbon or nylon plate is fine, as long as it works at my pace  
- ”Fun and secure” ride — something that keeps my legs from fatiguing too much during long efforts
- Not necessarily a stability shoe, but something with firmer foam or sidewalls to prevent wobble  
- **Snappier ride** — to avoid that “drowning in cushion” feeling  
- **Heel cushioning** — protective, but not overly soft or marshmallowy   

---

Would really appreciate any feedback or suggestions from runners with similar pace/build. Thanks in advance!",2025-04-10 19:25:38+00:00,1,4

Planning on a time in the 3:50-4hr range. Past shoes have included many years of Kinvaras, Hoka Gaviota 5s, and now using the Topo Specter 1s and Saucony Axon 3s in my training block. I don't feel like I can draw a lot of conclusions about what I like based on how I felt in them, but I am pretty committed to staying in the lower range (~<6mm) of heel drop for the time being. I also understand this is wise for downhill anyway.

For a lot of reasons I’m very committed to not using a plated shoe for my first marathon, and I’m trying to choose something good for racing such a downhill course outside those options.

I can't really do narrow and wear men's or unisex shoes for a lot of reasons. I’m most worried about my legs holding up through the distance and gravity, it would be nice to not feel totally uncomfortable in the process, and I’d also still like something with some pop to it so that the ride can feel a little more fun and speedy than my average run if possible. My budget is capped pretty firmly around $150.

So far I’ve identified the Adidas Evo SLs, New Balance Rebel v4s, and ASICS NOOSA Tri 16s as candidates. I’ve also thought about the Boston 12s, but know they've got the assistive energy rods and that puts me off a bit.

Based on research, I’m well aware the SB2 will work great for the longer workouts, but will it serve me well for my zone 2 long runs?

Course: course is relatively flat, few rollers it seems, and minimal turns. 

Pace goal: hoping for 2:50 pace. So ~6:30/mile. PR of 3:07 but was on pace for 2:55 through 20 before blowing up. 

Budget: probably wouldn’t spend 500 (looking at you adidas evo) but the normal 200-300 range is in budget.

Previous race shoes and thoughts: 

nike vapor fly 2, felt really good but ended up feeling unstable in later stages of race and my knee would begin to hurt. More so in the marathon but also in a recent half marathon. 

Puma deviate nitro elite 2. Felt good but just not as snappy as the vaporflys. Have only used for half races and up to 16 miles in training. 

Saucony endorphin pro 1. These felt pretty good and still do in workouts, but haven’t raced anything beyond a half in them. 

Foot/stride type: narrow feet with high arches. Generally a mid foot landing. Cadence hovers around 170 at race pace and 163 for easy runs (8:00). Stride length goes from 1.27m at easy to 1.55 at race pace. 2 years ago when I ran my marathon PR I had also struggled with posterior tibial issues in my foot which lead to reduced mileage on the 2 months before the race. 

Training shoes: I bounce around a lot for training shoes but have worn a socks Superblast 2s now, puma deviate nitro 2, nike Pegasus as my recent shoes for the better part of the last year. Have minimal complaints with any of these. 

Wants in the shoe: I want a shoe that is more responsive and lets me just zone out and lock in. Would like something snappy and with a little bit of stability.

1jv7jvx,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Plated shoes and the heavier runner,"Question that hit me after my shoe thread and one commented…. “If you’re not running 4:00/km’s.. waste of money”
I’ve read the science and most the Reddit reviews … it got me thinking.. this MAY be true for runners 140-165LB… but heavy runners i have to assume would adequately “load” the plate/shoe to get benefit… be it a little faster pace, or better. Fresher legs for half marathon and longer.  One guy here is 240lb and runs like a 5:15/km half.. 

So for  the sake of this conversation, 190LB +. (IN MY mind. Heavy is 220;lb and up). 

So, do you think carbon shoes only help the fast applies? Because i can tell you at 245lb.. 5:30/km and under is FAST!

I don't need a stability shoe but I've had some IT band troubles earlier this year and I think having a more stable shoe wouldn't hurt if I had to choose.

**Current rotation :**

* Daily Trainer : Hoka Mach 6
* Long Run : Asics Novablast 4
* Recovery : Brooks Glycerin Max
* Race : Hoka Cielo x1

Both Mach 6 and Novablast 4 are starting to get closer to retirement and i'm looking for a shoe that would fit more on the Speedier end of the spectrum for tack workouts as well as longer interval sessions, with decent stability, nimble feeling and very good energy return.

**So far, I've been considering :**

* Adidas Boston 12 (my guess being that they soon will be on sale with the approaching launch of the v13)
* Adidas Evo SL
* Puma Deviate Nitro 3
* Saucony Endorphin Speed 4
* Hoka Mach X2
* Asics Superblast 2

I'm running a 10 miles race around a local lake in 10 days (I know - a bit late to consider new shoes, but I'm still entertaining the idea).

Last year I ran 1:03:25 (3:56/km) and I'm trying to go sub 1:03 (≈3:54/km) or even close to 1:02 (3:51/km). My easy pace is around 4:20/km.

The course is flat, mostly on roads, but some sections (maybe 5km in total) are very light trails or packed sand. I'm a trail runner, so while I have 6 or 7 pairs of trail shoes, I have only one pair of road shoes (Adizero SL2).

I'm entertaining the idea of buying a road racing shoe in the next few days, testing it and racing in it next week-end.

The SL2 will do the job - so I might just stay with that. But I think I could use a race day road shoe for the one or two road races I'm running every year, so I'm considering this idea.

I'm considering the Kiprun KD900X.2 because of the really good reviews, and the price considering I won't use this so often. Wondering how the carbon plate will do on sand though.

I'm not a 'runner' as most of you guys are, but I do treadmill on max incline a lot and have ~20,000 steps per day outside the gym.

I had been using **Nike ZoomX Invincible 1/2/3** up until now - all of which I found great, but since they've been discontinued, I'd been looking at **Nike Pegasus Premium** as my daily walking shoes.

The thing is, I can never buy them online as they sell out before I can even reach the check-out page. I've been waiting for 3 months now, but if you check social media, almost everyone hates the fact that Nike is not releasing more pairs of them.

I bought **Vomero 18**, and will try my luck again on the 14^th for the new NPP colorway.

Also, all the reviews on Nike.com have been praising the shoes, but one guy said that they make a squeaking sound, is that true? I already have VaporMax, and they're annoying as hell on marble. And how do you find NPP comfort-wise? Again, I'm not a pro runner.

I’m a beginner-ish runner training for full IM in November. I ran about 250 miles in the Asics gel pulse 15 and decided it was time to upgrade. I’m a slow runner (slow runs ~11min/mi, faster runs ~8:30min/mile) and light weight (120lbs). I prefer light weight shoes. I’m a midfoot striker and I run all paved surfaces. 

I went to my local running store and tried on SO MANY shoes and ended up getting the Hoka Clifton 9s. Tried and did not like NB 1080, Saucony triumph, brooks ghost, asics cumulus. Hoka Mach 6 was ok but didn’t like it as much when I ran on the treadmill. I loved the fit and feeling of the Clifton 10s but they’re not Ironman legal :(. However after my first run in the Clifton 9s I don’t think they’re going to work as I had some uncomfortable rubbing in the arch of my left foot after about 4 miles.

When I was in the store they only had the 6.5 which I tried and liked on the treadmill, but it was recommended to go a half size larger (7) to make sure there was room for swelling on long runs. I liked the roomier/more rounded toe box shape. And I that it locked my heels in as I have very narrow heels, and generally pretty narrow feet.

So the question is: should I just get the smaller size? Should I give them a little longer to see if they break in and don’t bother me as much (I have 30 days to return them - but I would feel bad running that long in them and then returning).

1jueuus,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Second Pair of Running Shoes to Compliment Altra Experience Flow?,"**Background:** I'm a big boy (\~230 lb) and have ramped my running and exercise up in prep for a swimrun this summer. I'm doing \~18-20 miles per week (typical split: 3 miles, 2 miles, 5 miles, 8-10 miles). Swimming and lifting to supplement. Historically I've been a half marathoner (\~2 hours) and the few times I've tried to push for a marathon I've dealt with bad IT issues.

**Current Goals:** I'm running to train for a lot of hiking, to lose weight, and to be ready for this swimrun race as I said. I'd like to get to being comfortable with 13.1 runs \~1x per month again. That felt like a healthy good training load for me.

**Shoes:** I have historically ran on NB 1080s or Hoka Cliftons. When I started to get into running again in December I went to my local running store and liked two pairs of pretty different shoes: Altra Flows (11.5 wide), NB 880s (11.5 wide). I really liked the wide toe box and that there was less pillow under my foot. I bought the Altras and have been running on them ever since. In mid-Feb I got some bad shin splints so backed off it for a couple of weeks. I've been ramping back up and am feeling fine.

**Question:** As I'm starting to ramp up to real miles, I'm wondering if it's a good idea to have a second pair of shoes. I know Altras have a pretty unique feel (lower drop, lower profile, wider toe box) and while I like them, I've never dealt with shin splints before and wonder if that was driven by a new shoe style. What's the general sentiment to a second pair of training shoes? Should they be similar? Different from your other shoes? Any suggestions on a second set?

Let me go straight to the point 3 months ago i buyied the skyrise 5 cus i founded a nice deal (90€) and I read that was good for an all arounder use. ( I don't know that much about shoes so i was like, looks fine) Previously i owned two running shoes: asics novablast 1 and Brooks Ghost 14. My goal is to do 1km in 3m and 25 sec (rn i do 3.29 as a personal best) so...i used for 3 months the skyrise and honestly I found it quite difficult to get in shape/ in my previous times, but I thought it was due to the fact that I was out of shape and until last month my record was 3.42 with the skyrise (and I was literally dead at the end of every run test). One day out of curiosity I put my old Ghost 14's back on (not used that much so they were in good shape) and boom 3.33 and I was also pretty good at the end of the run, so I started using the ghosts again and really felt much better until the current result (also a few days ago I tried the skyrises again and did 3.40 literally dying at the end of the run). So. Is it possible that one shoe makes that much of a difference (also because the ghosts are not competition shoes or fast shoes at all) and would you recommend in case another model that might be right for me (nothing crazy).",2025-04-08 12:40:47+00:00,1,3

1ju4bvc,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Wide toebox shoe with some oomph? Looking to upgrade from Altra Experience Flows,"I have been running pretty regularly for the last 9 months wearing the Altra Experience Flow. They are a wide toebox shoe, with a low drop of 4mm. I usually run 4-6 mile runs, with the occasional long run and a half marathon in the mix. The shoes are wearing out and so I am looking into a new pair of everyday shoes.

I love how light this shoe is and how roomy the toebox is. Additionally, I find it easy to have good form and strike on the midfoot; However, I cannot help but feel like this shoe is ""firm."" I have not had any pain or discomfort, but I feel like this shoe is not helping me push off the ground, if that makes sense. It feels a little hard on my feet during longer runs.

I am looking for recommendations of a shoe that has a wide toebox but is a bit more springy. Something that is more responsive when I am pushing myself but also supportive on longer runs. I am not a fan of the super-cushioned shoes, but I am open to something a bit more plush. I have no budget, but am not necessarily looking for the fanciest shoe.

If it is relevant: About 10 years ago in high school I ran XC and track, so I am familiar with knowing when a shoe fits my feet but am unfamiliar with the current shoe market. I used to wear a lot of New Balance, although I cannot remember the model. My feet hated the Nike Pegasus. I had a history of bursitis and plantar fasciitis.

To preface.. I am an amateur runner, just recently got into running via C25K last September. I used to be very active and involved in a lot of sports growing up but got inactive and gained a lot of weight since working an office job for years. I'm a 29yo 1.63m female around 79kg, I've recently completed two 5K races at around 39-40 mins.

I want to get faster, but my lungs give out before my legs at the moment, so I have been doing zone 2 runs once a week. I go to the gym 3 times a week and I do arms, speed work on a treadmill, and do strength training for my legs on each respective day. 

I currently train for my runs wearing the Adidas Adizero Evo SL. They are very comfy for me and I have used them in the 5K races I participated in. I recently purchased a pair of Adios Pro 3s from Ebay with it's authenticity guaranteed through Ebay for half the retail price, albeit I am still a slow runner, I intended to have it as a goal for me to be able to run fast enough to race in them one day. 

Took these Adios Pro 3s out for a easy run today and I have had some trouble with them. The collar of the shoe scratches my Achilles (this might be a sock problem I think), and my right foot arch started to hurt after like 3km. I assumed it was just my feet not being used to the carbon rod.  When I first wore the EVO SLs they felt amazing and I actually ran further and longer than I ever did. 

I really love the design of these AP3s and besides the other issues I really liked the cushioning and the rocking part of it. I've read that carbon plated shoes require some breaking in so are these issues just because they're still new?

Anyway it will be long before I'll fully utilise the shoe well just wanted some thoughts on it as I continue to train myself to be faster. Thank you all for reading. ",2025-04-07 20:08:04+00:00,2,5
1jturog,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Asics Novablast 5 Fit Advice,"


Hi everyone, I’m looking for some advice on running shoe fit. For context, I’m a beginner running and realized my shoes are too small so I’m trying to get some that fit properly. My right foot is over half a size bigger than my left foot so I ordered these shoes based on my right foot’s measurements. My feet also measure slightly narrower than standard but these are normal width. 

Do you all think these fit well or are they too large? I tried on half a size smaller before and there was not a full thumb’s width of space in front of my right toe. I’m worried that the fabric bunching up on my left foot indicates that they are too big but the space in front of my right foot seems right to me. What do you all think? 

For reference, these are the Asics Novablast 5 in women’s 11.5 (eu 44). I typically wear EU 41-42 in other non-running shoes, some of which are probably a bit too small but others fit fine.",2025-04-07 20:01:32+00:00,1,5

I often wear 11.5D sneakers because i find 11D to be too cramped in the toe box (pinky toe pushed inwards) on most models. Do I just have long toes?

To complicated things, I tried on some wide sneakers today. The closest thing I could find to my size was an 11(4E), but it felt amazing in the toe box and I felt like I was able to lace it tight enough to not have heel slip and feel stable walking around the store.

Hello everyone, I would like to preface that I am very new into the whole walking/running shoe scene and so perhaps this is an obvious question but I have looked around a bit and couldn't seem to find a clear, agreed upon answer (if there even is one).

I just got a pair of Brooks Ghost Max 2's after looking around for a new pair of daily walking shoes and I really love them so far. Since I plan on using these everyday, walking multiple hours per day (somewhere in the range of 15k steps per day -- 187cm tall, 85kg if that matters) I was concerned about the foam recovery time and how long roughly it would take for the foam to fully bounce back into its shape and decompress (I have asked a couple friends who can't agree upon an answer and since I didn't even know foam recovery time / bounce back was a thing until recently I'm not sure where to ask or how exactly to ask it.)

Is it worth me buying a 2nd pair or even a 2nd and 3rd pair of Ghost Max 2's and alternating between them all? Or is this all just myths, superstitions and marketing designed to get more money out of my wallet. One of my friends said 3 pairs of the same shoes is optimal for their lifetime but that seems... excessive. I'm sure it's different for every brand since they all use their own foam and different tech so I'm really not sure. Hopefully someone with more experience in this can help me out.

I cant tell if this would be ok to go jogging with, im new to this and have messed up buying shoes before.

length wise I feel this is ok. (or is it?)  
I do feel that the right shoe without the insole feels much better around the mid foot. more roomy.   
With the insole it feels pretty snug, like a very well fitting close to the skin in everyway kind of suit that you just wanna take off.

I need some advice on choosing the right type of footwear—or even better, a specific model of running shoes.

So far, I’ve been running in Adidas Solarboost 4, and they’ve worked pretty well, but recently some old injuries have started coming back, and I’m not sure how much of that is related to the shoes.

When I run, I have a slight supination, and in combination with running on hard surfaces, I feel pain around the fifth metatarsal bone near the heel. I’ve never fractured it, but I have undergone therapy, mostly electrical stimulation, and the condition had significantly improved. However, after a long winter break, the same issue has returned. Running itself feels fine, but a few days later, the pain starts again. Then it’s back to therapy and rest all over again.

As for my running, it’s not a fast pace or anything extreme, around 5 to 6 minutes per kilometer, usually distances between 5 and 10 kilometers.

What should I focus on when choosing new shoes? I’m especially curious about the type of sole, something softer sounds logical, but I’m not sure if that’s the best option.

1jtgsft,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Noosa Tri 16 vs. Adios 9 vs. something else for Olympic Tri,"Hiya!

I need to buy some shoes for two olympic triathlons coming up (10KM).

I currently run in Asics Novalblast 4 and I love them. I doubt its going to realistically be an issue, but they are techincally banned for triathlon starting this year. I never tried Adidas, but I do like the look of them.

In terms of myself, Im quite a new runner (I estimate my pace for the 10K to be around 5:30-6:00/KM, depending on how knackered Im going to be after the bike). Im also quite heavy (183CM, 88KG). Midfoot striker, dont think I need stability.

Which would be the better option for me? Im open to other suggestions as well.  
I could also splurge a bit and get a plated shoe like the Takumi Sen, but I dont fully think that would be neccesary given my pace.  
I just also note that I can get the Adios 9 for quite cheap at the moment.

I am a 6'6, 125KG ""Noobie"" runner , my way of saying ive never really run before, ever.  After watching the Brighton marathon yesterday consisting of people from all ages, weights and abilities it has inspired me to want to do something like that myself.  I currently play Rugby, but as the end of the season has just come upon us, im looking for a new challenge this summer.

  
I have set my goals on running a 10K by the end of Summer / the year.  My problem is i dont know what shoes i should be looking for.  I know its different for many people but am hoping to get some of your thoughts on what you think would be suitable for my size and ability.  Stats are as follows:

  
6'6

125KG - heavy build (but not mega fat)

Size 14 UK

Can currently run about 300-600m without getting out of puff at steady pace.

Strength train at the gym 5 days a week roughly (strong, but no endurance)



Any advice would be appreciated.  I am on a relatively tight budget, but can push to maybe £150 for a pair of beginner training running shoes.

1jt8ts2,AskRunningShoeGeeks,"I think my shoes might be causing my Achilles pain, and would love some guidance/recommendations.","Hi everyone,

Last September I fractured my right shin, and had to go to physical therapy for two months. I learned that I have an over-pronation problem, and my physical therapist suggested I get stability shoes. Two months ago I bought Brooks Adrenaline GTS 24s. My PT also suggested I buy Protalus insoles, so I got those too and replaced the stock Brooks insoles with them. I liked the shoes, but I noticed that I developed pain in my right Achilles tendon after every run. This pain would persist for a few days in the beginning but two weeks ago I ran 4.5 miles and I still felt pain four days later. I noticed that walking around in my everyday sneakers/boots didn't give me any Achilles pain, but the pain started from the moment I put the Brooks on and started walking in them. Oddly, my left Achilles tendon is pain-free, so maybe the fracture is playing a role? I'm not sure. It occurred to me that it may have been the insoles causing this issue. Some cursory reading suggested that maybe replacement insoles aren't necessary for stability shoes, but I'm not sure. So I tried running with the stock Brooks insoles, but the pain persisted.

So I went and got another pair of stability shoes to see if the specific Brooks shoes were the issue. I got a pair of Asics Gel Kayano 31s. I ran with them on Tuesday and still felt Achilles pain. I haven't run at all since then and let the pain subside completely. Today I put the Asics on just to run some errands and the pain came back. I wasn't running in them at all and I wasn't even walking in them for very long.

Doing some more reading, it seems that a lot of stability shoes have very firm heel counters (a term I was not familiar with) and that these might cause Achilles pain for some people. Obviously I'm not sure if this is the definitive cause of my issue, but it seems possible, given that I've never had this problem before, I've now had it with two different pairs of stability shoes, and the pain only began/progressed when I was wearing those shoes.

So my options seem to be a.) find a stability shoe with a less firm heel counter or b.) switch back to a non-stability shoe. What would my best option be? I'm sort of loath to do option b, as I'd be afraid of over-pronation and fracturing my shin again, but if using the Protalus insoles I bought in non-stability shoes would serve a similar function as stability shoes, I'd be fine with that. If option a is my best option, I'd love some stability shoe recommendations.

FWIW, I do plan on getting checked out by my PT to make sure I haven't done any consequential damage to my Achilles. But I don't want to run again until I can get some shoes that aren't actively injuring me. I'd really appreciate any help/guidance, as this has been a very long and annoying ordeal.

1jt72yg,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Help with new shoe query RE: shin pain,"

Hi, 

Hope someone with more experience with a variety of shoes could  help. 

Main question is at the bottom if you want to skip :)

I recently purchased a pair of Adidas boston 12's as I had seen some very good reviews on YouTube for them. 
The first time I wore them I got terrible shin splint type pain from a 2km run. 

For  context 2 days later I ran the sheffield half marathon in a pair of Hoka Mach X which gave no pains whatsoever (also managed a PB :) 

I also have in my rotation Inov8 roadfly, on cloudsurfer, scarpa ribelle run, hoka tecton x, pegasus trail 5, all of which give no pains.

I read that the laces on the boston 12'S can cause lockdown issues so purchased some different laces to perform a proper racers knot. I've been out for 2 more runs in the bostons which did cause some pain, but not quite to the same extent. 

My main question is, do I persevere with the bostons with the view that my muscles/tendons etc are adapting to a new stimulus, or do I move on from these and realise they're just not a shoe that suits me? 

I was also looking at getting a pair of adios pro 3s as my training schedule is starting to pick up with a view to doing more races,  but I'm worried I'll have the same reaction to them as I have the bostons 🤷‍♂️

Apologies for the long post, I'm not great at sticking on track 😕 ",2025-04-06 23:07:07+00:00,2,1

I (25F) have put on some weight after having kids. This summer I plan on doing a lot of walking (outside on pavement and trails), then once I’m done nursing my baby get back into the gym. So I decided to get new shoes for my walks, and to use to go to the gym in the near future.

I purchased the Cloudrunner 2s (which was very hard for me since they are quite pricey). I’m second guessing purchasing them because I’m wondering if I should have shopped around and done more research. I was NOT planning on buying Ons but they were the most comfortable. 

I’m realizing that I have moderate overpronation and ChatGPT suggested getting the Cloudflyer 4s or 5s.

1jsh423,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Help! Every running shoe I've owned feels too firm underfoot. Am I wearing the wrong shoes?,"Hi all.

I started running in 2020 with $60 pair of Adidas Supercloud running shoes. Back then I knew nothing about running shoes and just bought a cheap pair in a colour I liked. I jogged 1000km in those over 2 years, running no more than 5km at a time.

Then I signed up for a 10km event and decided to get 'proper' running shoes. Went into a running shoe store and was recommended a pair of Brooks Adrenaline 21s. I ran another 1000km in them over 1 year, this time running some half marathons, a marathon and a 100km ultra.

However my right knee started hurting after runs, and I had to take a month off to recover.

At this time I read some online reviews and decided give Brooks Ghost 13 a try. I ran 500km in them before my knee pains came back.

So I then proceeded to try Brooks Glycerin 19 (meant to be better cushioned than Adrenalines and Ghosts although not quite 'max cushion'). I was quite happy with them though and ran 700km in them.

Now I rotate between HOKA Skyflow and Glycerin 20 for my weekly total of 40km (10km, 10km, 20km).

However I never found that any of these shoes felt plush underfoot. They feel quite firm. Glycerin 20s are supposed to be well cushioned, and some reviews state that Skyflows are 'max cushioned' shoes.

Do I have to get HOKA Bondis to finally feel that 'marshmallow' feeling underfoot? Many reviews criticise them for lack of responsiveness so I'm not sure it's worth it. Or do I need to pay $$$ and go for Glycerin Max or HOKA Cielo?

While I was laid up I purchased a pair of Hoka Arahi 6 shoes as they were listed as a stability shoe and I presumed that would help with rehabbing my ankle. Since then I’ve played around with zero drop and barefoot type shoes. I’ve noticed that while wearing my minimalist shoes I don’t get much for foot pain outside of some heel and ball soreness which I assume is because of lack of cushioning and reduction in impact . But when I’m wearing my hokas, my bottom feet muscles get sore as if they’re almost working harder? Idk if the softer sole causes them to move and grip more than minimalist shoes? Minimalist shoes are always marketed as “strengthening your feet muscles”? I primarily wear the hokas when walking a lot and/or going to be on my feet for long periods. The muscles I’m referring to are between the heel and ball both in the arch and on the outside of my foot as well as some tightness in my calf. There some sensation of the PF at the base of the heel. The pain overall isn’t brutal or unbearable but they’re soar compared to some of my other shoes. I would think with all the cushion that the hokas would be easier on the feet. Any opinions?

I thought you all the best bunch to go to to inquire about a second pair of running shoes. I am 6'4"" and weigh about 210 pounds. Currently I average 15-30 miles a week, but intend to ramp up my miles as I'm looking to complete a marathon this year. My pace is around 7:45-8:30 minutes per mile!

My current daily trainers are **Brooks Glycerin Max**, which I have run about 230 miles in! I love these shoes and am looking forward to keeping them as my daily trainer, using them for long runs and chill runs. My one qualm however, is that this is the first pair of shoes I have run in that seem slow to me! This doesn't necessarily come as a surprise considering how much cushion and *squish* these shoes have.

I am looking for: a shoe that feels quicker than the Brooks Glycerin Max! A shoe that I can use for my tempo and threshold training, as well as for race day on Marathons and Half-Marathons. The super shoes don't make sense to me at this point, as shoes like the Metaspeed, Alphafly, and Endorphin Elite seem like the type that you only break out for official race day! Also, injury prevention is first priority!

Looking for a running shoe for the fire academy. I currently have asics gel cummulus 21 and NB rebel v4. The asics are pretty good but I’d like something more light weight. I absolutely hate the rebels. They’re too soft and squishy and feel wobbly. I end up just running in my Nike air max 270s but I want something more suitable. I have flat feet and don’t like the always suggested stability shoes. They end up hurting my foot. I’d rather a neutral shoe and I can always add my custom orthotics if I choose.

1js7jsa,AskRunningShoeGeeks,6'0/182cm Wide Forefoot/Narrow Heel Shoe Recommendation?,"Hello all,  
&nbsp;  
Let me preface this by saying that I did in fact check out the wiki but unfortunately it doesn't provide me with a good answer.  
&nbsp;  
I'm a 6'0/182cm tall male, on the heavier side at 103 kg/227 lbs. My feet are shaped in a bit of an upside down triangle with a very wide forefoot and a narrow heel. This means that most ""common solutions"" like getting 4E shoes results in my midfoot being loose and my heel having an entire football field of space for itself.  
&nbsp;  
My feet are 28cm / 11 inch long and 11.5cm / 4.5 inch at the widest part in the forefoot. I'm currently running in New Balance 860v14s in 4E at size 45 for the past year. My pinky toes are finally happy, but its like I'm wearing clown shoes and the heel part of my shoes is absolutely destroyed due to the movement of my heel since no matter what knot I try, they're having a lot of space. For reference I'm normally a size 44 in shoes.  
&nbsp;  
Since I have a 5km event run coming up, I've been looking for new shoes since these 860's are pretty beat up and used up. So far I've tried the 880v15's in 45 / 2E (4E not available) but those were too narrow, as were the Asics Kayano 31's in 45 / 4E albeit by a small amount but enough to cause my pinky toe to go numb. I'm not sure if sizing up to 46 in the Kayano's would make a difference?  
&nbsp;  
Thus I've been looking at options, and reviews, and videos and seemingly keep ending up at Altra shoes that seem to be more suited for my foot shape. Therefore there are two options that I'm currently looking at that hopefully fix my issues, with a third and fourth option for non-altra's:  
&nbsp;  
1. Altra FWD Via (Original / Wider fit)  
2. Altra Experience Flow/Form  (Standard / Medium Fit)  
3. Buy another pair of NB 860v14s/4E and deal with the clown shoe heel.  
4. Size up to 46/4E on the Kayano 31's in hopes it gives me enough room.  
&nbsp;  
What can you guys advise me? I'm open to anything at this point. Unfortunately I don't have a lot of options when it comes to shoe fittings for my wide feet and have to gamble with return policies on e-tailers instead, of which very few offer 4E options to begin with.",2025-04-05 16:38:30+00:00,2,2

My daily runs are around 5-10k at a 6min/km pace.

Currently using the Ride 16, though the outsole rubber keeps separating from the midsole (I swear I've glued them at least 5 times by now). They're good but they are a little harsh on my joints after the 8-10km mark, anything below that is fine though. 

Only ever had daily trainers (Vapor Street Flyknit, Ride 16) and speed shoes (Adios 6 and 7), no experience at all with max cushion shoes.

I got pretty good deals on the MagMax and SL2 for around the same price. I understand both have different purposes but preferably I'd want something that's a daily trainer which are more cushioned than the Rides.

My third go-to brand is Mizuno, but there's no way in hell I'm going to be seen wearing those Rebellion Pro 3s. Happy to see the brand actually going for innovation again, though.

1jryb45,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Help finding the correct shoe! Issues with the More V5,"Hi everyone,  
I'm not a runner or experienced long-distance walker, but I’m heading to Japan this May and expect to walk a lot. I also want something I can wear at work, where I’m often on my feet.

Right now, I wear some old Puma Enzo 2 Refresh in size EU42. They fit me perfectly in terms of shape and comfort, but they’re basic and lack real cushioning or support. I wore them on a walking-heavy trip to Prague and got noticeable foot pain—likely from the lack of support (and just not being used to that much walking).

After reading reviews, I tried the New Balance Fresh Foam X More v5 in EU42.5. They felt great in-store, but in real use they gave me pain, especially in my pinky toes. The whole shoe feels tight and low in the toe box, like my foot is being squeezed.

A bit about my feet:

* Somewhat flat and wide
* I’m used to a bit of heel support and have felt heel pain in the past with very flat shoes
* The Pumas I use now feel great in terms of vertical space inside the shoe, especially around the toes

Before trying the “wide” version of the More v5 (which might not fix the cramped height), I’d love your recommendations for shoes that:

* Have a roomy toe box (both width and height)
* Are good for wide/flat feet
* Offer some heel support (not zero drop)
* Work well for long walking days and standing at work

1jrwhc7,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Asics Daily Trainers,"Hi, thanks a lot for going through my post

I'm a beginner-intermediate runner, and i get around 40-50 km done a week. I run 5 times a week, and my easy paces are around 6:30/km, while tempo paces are around 5:00. I'm mainly only preparing for 10k at the moment (current pb is 53:10), but 21k is still an option in the future.

Now all I really need is a daily trainer that gets it all done without a second thought. I may add a second shoe in the rotation later when I get more serious, but at the moment 1 is all I really want to spend.

The asics neutral line-up is probably what's appealing the most to me because other brands like nike, adidas, saucony, and puma are a bit more expensive where i live. However, I don't want to spend too much and would likely get last year's model to save a bit of money.

The shoes I'm really looking at are the Cumulus 26, Nimbus 26, and Novablast 4. I know the novablast is probably the best of the bunch for what I'm trying to do here, but there is a significant price difference between all 3, and I'm wondering if I really need the novablast or if the cumulus or nimbus would suffice for me. For reference, The cumulus I can buy now for 60 USD, the nimbus for 90 USD, and the novablast for about 130 USD.

I also saw positive feedback about the SL2, but from what I've been given to understand, that's more of a faster shoe?? Please correct me if i'm wrong. I can get the SL2 for around the same price as the Nimbus.

1jrwdfg,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Rockered Shoes causing tiredness in the quads?,"brief background:

I am currently a slow running 29min 5k. My goal for now is to get back into the Sub1 10k. 10 years ago, I was a better runner 47 min 10k and at that time, shoes were more lower stack. I particularly enjoyed the Adizero feather and similar Racing Flats. I raced on the first Adios boost, which at that time felt like cheating, but pretty minimalistic in todays standards.

My preferences carried over to 2025. I am enjoying the Adios 8 and 9 for intervals and tempo runs, and the SL2 for easy runs. I came across an Evo SL on my size on stock one day randomly. I know it's a hype shoe so I bought it and thought it should easily fit into the Adizero family that I enjoy. I intend to replace the Adios for tempo runs, however when I tried it out, I was able to meet my goals but my quads feel like being worked more during the whole ordeal. It never happens, maybe because I am used to running in low stack shows where my running mechanics tend to load the lower leg. My calves may get tired or experience some plantar fascia issues, but never felt that my quads are getting worked up that much.

Is there something that causes rockered shoes to stress the quads? Or is it just the higher stack height and instability of the non-plated LS pro, so my quads work to regain stability?

A more practical question: I am in a market for a Carbon Plated pair. I intend to only race 5-10k in the next year or so. Should I get the Adios Pro 4, which I heard should be good even for shorter races, or get the Takumi Sen 10 (or 11 when it comes out)? The Adios Pro 4 seems to be a better deal, but I am scared that it doesn't fit with my running mechanics. The Takumi is a specialized short distance racer, lower stack so less protection, but seems to be more inline with my current running mechanics. Should I learn running in ""modern"" shoes for a long term benefits, like better protection and energy return? Or stick with what my body is already used to?",2025-04-05 05:33:11+00:00,4,13

1jrcw93,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Speed work shoes for wide feet?,"5’10, 200 lbs, 11.5 4E

I’m looking for a shoe to add into my rotation for speed work and keep going in circles. I’m technically a 2E width but super high volume so end up having to wear a 4E. I’ve been looking at SC trainer v3, Novablast, Hyperion, maybe Magic Speed? I’ve also seen some people have good experience sizing up in Superblast for wide feet? Honestly I’ve got no idea. For years I’ve only been able to afford one pair at a time so I’ve been just cruising in Adrenaline and have no concept of what other types of shoes are like.

I’m open to any brands, hoping for mid to high cushion, any budget. I’ve been dealing with bursitis and the higher cushion seems to really be helping but I also understand that faster shoes mean lighter/stiffer. 

Current line up:

Brooks Adrenaline 24: 11.5 4E - old reliable, great fit 
ASICS Nimbus 27: 11.5 4E - a replacement for some 1080s and my favorite shoes ever.

1jrah9y,AskRunningShoeGeeks,"Looking for a Daily Trainer Between Streakfly and Vaporfly (More Cushion, No Plate Preferred)","Hey all,

I’ve been using Nike shoes for a while and generally really enjoy them. My current rotation includes:
	•	Streakfly v1 for slow/easy runs — I like the flexibility and the fact there’s no carbon plate.
	•	Vaporfly v2 and v3 for long runs, fartlek sessions, and track workouts — love the pop and energy return there.

That said, I’ve gone through a few pairs of Streakflys and I’m finding the shoe life to be pretty short. They’re great, but they seem to wear down way too fast, especially for a shoe I use several times a week.

I’m looking to adjust my philosophy a bit and find a replacement for the Streakfly in my rotation — something I can use for my easy days, with a bit more cushion, ideally no carbon plate, and something that’ll last longer than the Streakfly. Basically a “middle ground” between the Streakfly and the Vaporfly.

Any recommendations for a daily trainer that fits this use case ? (I’d prefer to stay with Nike)

Thanks in advance !

1jrabxq,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Found myself in a weird situation - ASICS Glideride Max or Gel-Nimbus 27?,"I've been looking for a recovery shoe that is easy on the joints for slow, recovery runs. Narrowed it down to the Glideride Max and the Nimbus 27.

So I went to the ASICS store to try them both on, with the intention to buy which ever I liked better. I tried them on, walked around the store, tested them, and ran in both (there was a treadmill set up in store). Turns out, both were fantastic and both felt fantastic during the test runs.

But, the Glideride felt a tad bit more comfortable during non-running (like walking and standing still) - the heel padding on the Nimbus 27 is more 'pronounced', and as someone who has to wear orthotics, the raised heel padding just felt a bit awkward. Leaning 60-40 in favour of the Glideride, I walked away feeling quite happy.

Now here's the dilemma - literally an hour later, due to a pricing error, I saw an online retailer selling the Nimbus 27's for AU$50 (\~US$30) a pair. Without thinking, I copped a pair, and seconds later, the online retailer realised the error, and reverted back to full price (AU$260). But, they agreed to honour any sales made during the active pricing error. So the question is, keep the Glideride Max (since I did slightly prefer it) and return/sell the Nimbus 27 on marketplace, or return the Glideride and keep the Nimbus 27?

Can anyone who owns these shoes weigh in please? Thanks!",2025-04-04 12:11:29+00:00,2,10

Hoping for some advice. Female, 36, \~60kg, been running all my life but really consistently the last 5 years. I have feet than overpronate and when I try to increase my mileage (even very gradually) I get ankle pain (specifically tibialis posterior).

  
I have orthotics and I was running in On Cloudflyers. They felt a bit small and very firm with the orthotics and my ankles were flaring up. So I got some Novablast 5s and my ankle pain disappeared. This went really well for a few months but the ankle pain is back now that I'm up to 20-25km per week.

  
I was going to physio most of last year regularly and strength training. Doing a million calf raises. And have been going again to physio for the past 6 weeks with no improvement. So I'm looking into my shoes again.

  
I'm training for a half marathon and I think the Novablast 5s would be fine for the race but perhaps I need a more stable shoe for daily runs? Maybe I swung too neutral/cushioned? I do feel pretty wobbly in them when I'm just walking around.

  
What would you suggest?

For the last year or so I’ve been dealing with persistent lower calf/achilles tightness and strains when running. I experience this issue on both legs so wondering if it might be shoe related. Bought some new Brooks Glycerin Max a couple weeks ago, which were recommended to me by the running store I go to, to help with my calves. So far these have not helped and if anything, they are making it worse.

My previous shoes were Brooks Ghost Max, which I bought about a year ago. Coincidentally, this is when my calf issues started. Hard to tell if they’re responsible as I had also ramped up my training intensity to cram in a marathon before the birth of my child, which ultimately ended with a calf strain half way through my training. At the time I figured the injury was from ramping up too quickly. I’ve been taking it slower this go around, but still having issues.

Everything I’ve read online says higher heel drop shoes help with calf issues, which I believe these 2 shoes are considered high heel drop. Recently saw a PT to try and figure out my issue and they think it’s related to ankle instability. So I’m starting to wonder if higher heel drop was not the right choice for my case.

Unfortunately, I can't find any in size 13, and the new version 2.0 have lost all the versatility that made the 1.0 so perfect. They've got awful stability, don't fit as well, and don't work as well when I'm slowing down a bit.

  
**What shoe is like the Cielo X1 1.0? What are you buying as a replacement now that they're not produced any longer?** This was pretty much the top shoe of 2024, and Hoka stopped making it after less than a year. Very frustrating. Some of their shoes they still produce are over 2.5 years old, yet they're cancelling a top seller like the Cielo X1 1.0 within 12 months...ugh",2025-04-03 07:50:50+00:00,4,15

1jq7wv2,AskRunningShoeGeeks,First carbon plated shoe?,"Hi all!!! I'm running my first half in early May.
According to my training plan, my projected finishing time is 1:52-1:57 (around 8:55 pace or so) I would absolutely love to break 2 hours for my first half, and I’ve heard plated shoes can make that slight difference of breaking a certain time or not.

My current tempo shoe is the Saucony Endorphin Speed 4 and I LOVE them. I know I could likely race in them, but I think I'm wanting something with a bit more cushion for race day, but still some good pop.

I currently have my eyes on the NB Supercomp Elite v4 and the Saucony Endorphin Pro 4's (a bit iffy on going for the EP4 because shoe-reviewer Kofuzi says they lack energy return, but please let me know what your experience is).

1jq648j,AskRunningShoeGeeks,When should a broke runner buy Evo SL,"I'm relatively new to the running shoe scene, but I really like running shoes! The main problem is that I'm broke - so I keep myself limited to a two-shoe running rotation (Saucony Triumph 21 and Adidas Adizero SL 2)! It's hard trying not to be tempted to buy more shoes, and I've had to return a few carbon-plated impulse buys recently! (vaporfly 3, cielo x1)

Just like everybody else, I'm a sucker for the Adidas Evo SLs, which I plan to replace my faster shoe (SL 2) with in about a year or year and a half when I hit big miles on the latter shoe.

The Evo SL just recently landed as part of the global release at retail price (240$ AUD) in Australia at a few retailers (notably Pace Athletic and [Adidas.com.au](http://adidas.com.au/) website). I've found a few pairs in the colourway and size 8 US mens I want, but I'm willing to wait it out for sales.

Two issues here:

1. I'm expecting the biggest sales in the crossover period when the Evo SL's successor releases, when retailers have to clear stock. The problem is that I have no idea when or even if that will happen. That might be 2-3 years down the road, and I also have no guarantee that the Evo SL '2' would be better (to the point where it would drive clearance for the Evo SL).
2. I'd buy if there was about a 40% discount, or at a 30% discount if I'm generous. But seeing current stock levels (falling) and demand for the Evo SL (rising) here in Aus, am I a fool for not buying at retail now? Surely the shoe won't appreciate, right?",2025-04-03 01:46:50+00:00,7,11
1jq4768,AskRunningShoeGeeks,"Any wide midfoot ""super"" shoes out there?","I'm 240 lb 5'9"" M, and I've been testing shoes to find some that fit me well.

But I'm having some issues with my left foot; it seems to be about an inch longer than my right foot, and a bit wider, as well. I'm between a D and 2E; so some wide D's fit, and most 2E fit. But the problem is that, while they fit, I have some pain on the left edge of my midfoot. Many shoes I test seem to either have some foam or tightness that hit the pressure on that edge; I don't know if I somehow hurt it, or if a shoe caused it; but I've had to give up on many shoes because the pain is so bad often I won't be able to walk with the shoes on.

My size seems to be 10.5.  
I tried the Puma MagMax Nitro at 10.5 but it hit the pressure point. I'm waiting for the MagMax Nitro on 11. The Superblast 2 on 11 is hitting the same point, even though there doesn't seem to be any foam right where the pain is. I'm hoping the 11.5 would be a bit wider but I'm not holding hope.

So I'm wondering if there are any similar shoes that would be wider.

Right now, shoes that work:  
1080 v13 11 wide  
Kayano 31 10.5 wide  
Novablast 5 10.5 wide  
Guide 18 11 regular

Shoes that don't work:  
More v4 10 regular - to tight everywhere  
Hurricane 10.5 wide - weird pain on ball of foot  
MagMax Nitro 10.5 regular - excruciating pain on the pressure point, specially when not running  
Superblast 2 11 regular - haven't tested in run, but painful - not as bad as MagMax Nitro

(extra shoes that didn't work):  
Hoka Bondi 8 10.5 - midfoot pain  
Hoka Clifton 9 10.5 - toes numb, weird disconnect between feet and ground  
Hoka Arahi 7 10.5 wide - not enough volume (I heard the Arahi 6 wide was better but couldn't find one in my size anywhere)  
Hoka Gaviota 10.5 wide - same midfoot pain, although otherwise spacious.

I'm waiting on MagMax Nitro 11 regular  
Endorphin Speed 4 11 regular

I'm planning on getting orthotics soon, in case that matters. I've been told I overpronate, although I don't feel it; I thought I supinated a little, tbh.

I was looking for something that would hold my weight for longer distances and a bit more fun than Kayano/1080 to pick up the pace a bit, as well. I don't know that ""super shoe"" was the correct term.

Any suggestions/advice would be greatly appreciated.

Would breaking in the shoe help?

1jpywdy,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Neo Zen sizing question,"Hey. Basically I've read that it's best to go half a size down with these but Mizuno's sizing appears to be a bit different, on top of this fact. Plus equivalent UK sizes can get confusing.

But Mizuno's equivalent sizing goes: UK 8 / US 9 / EU 42. So if I went with the EU measurement I'd already be half a size down.

Also note that I do like shoes to be snug and I have slightly narrow and slightly low-volume feet.

Adidas AP3 - I’ve put roughly 160km/100mi on these, up to HM distance in a race, and up to 30km in training. A hole has developed on both uppers above the big toe, but I’m not too concerned about catching my toe in it after test runs. They got worse, I believe, because on one workout/dress-rehearsal run my toe came through a hole in my old sock and caught on the hole in the upper… TMI, I know.

Puma DNE3 - I purchased out of panic when the holes got worse on the AP3 recently. I’ve taken them for a couple of MP test runs totalling 8km/5mi. First run felt a bit firmer than I’d like (my ankles and calves were sore) but the second run, which was an A/B test with the AP3s, felt great.

My heart wants to go with the DNE3 - they’re so much more comfortable on my feet, and don’t have holes in them. But my head/gut is saying AP3 because they’re tried and tested at long distances.

I’m just looking for as many opinions as possible. Does anyone have experience taking the DNE3 the full marathon distance? I see a lot of people saying they’re too firm or unstable for the 26.2.",2025-04-02 20:11:02+00:00,4,2

I plan on adding shorter runs, probably 5k at most, not trying to get into long distance running. I'm a bit heavier at 215lbs and I'm more of a mid/forefoot striker with medium arches. My previous running shoes were the Saucony Triumph 20, but I wasn't a fan of the 10mm drop and they felt squishy, idk. I specifically grabbed the Torin and Magniflys for the zero-drop and wide toe box. I already wear zero-drop wide toe shoes daily, so no real transition needed. My knees kinda suck, so I do want at least a bit of cushion, but nothing crazy since I'll be doing shorter distances. I'll be primarily running on the road/sidewalk and community trail.

My initial thoughts on the shoes I'm deciding between:  
**Torin 8**  
*Pros*  
A bit more stack, could be nicer on the knees  
No obnoxious arch support

*Cons*  
Feels kinda stiff out of the box, idk  
My right foot feels a little tired walking around in them, haven't ran in them yet - the Sauconys made my right foot feel extra fatigued/numb after a short run, idk what's up with that.

**Magnifly 5**  
*Pros*  
I immediately liked the upper, feels nice  
Enough stack without being super squishy

*Cons*  
I feel like this would be a perfect shoe if it weren't for that obnoxious arch support

Thanks in advance for any advice and insights.

Edit: I also wouldn’t mind different suggestions if you think there’s a different shoe I’d like. I want a wide toe box, but I’m more flexible on the heel drop as long as it isn’t too high.",2025-04-01 20:06:08+00:00,2,1

So, I’m wondering if or when they’re going to restock the Evo SL in Canada. I’ve also heard rumour that the wide version was supposed to drop in March in the US? This would be massive news if true, since I’ve got some wide feetsies. With that said, if they do make a wide version and it takes 827 years to get to Canada, then it’s pointless.

However, my best long runs have been in the Asics Superblast 2, which is expensive but I can get it with a 20% discount. With that discount, its price gets close to the other shoes, which—except for the Vomero—I find too expensive for what they offer.

Looking for some suggestions for a firmer daily trainer for my next marathon training block. I purchased both the Novablast 5s and Rebel v4s for my last block and encountered knee pain after a 100km in each of them.

Had no knee issues with my Boston 12s (which was my tempo shoe) so wore them for the vast majority of the training (I assume the reason these were better is because they’re a ‘firmer’ running shoe but open to correction). 

I am hoping to get a more general daily trainer instead of the Bostons as I don’t think they’re an ideal trainer for long, slow 30km runs. 

Unfortunately due to where I live, there are no running shoe shops that stock multiple brands/sizes and I can’t afford to keep dropping money on shoes that get relegated down to “walking shoes” after a month or so.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, hoping some people here may have been in similar situation.

1jowhz3,AskRunningShoeGeeks,How is the Glycerin Max after 600KM?,"Let me tell you!

**Since I can’t post in main sub due to a new account, I’m spreading the good word in the ARSG sub**

Total distance: 600km

Type of runs: Daily training (5-20mi)-> 5mi Recovery Runs

Weather ran in: Very nice weather (SoCal)

Runner Profile: 6’2 200lb Midfoot Striker 7:30-8:00/mi easy runs & 10:00/mi recovery runs

Splurged on these back in late October after I ran Chicago. I knew I wanted them before I even tried them on as I have traditionally been a brooks fan but trying them on in the shop certainly solidified me on it. Took them for a few easy runs in San Francisco and Boston as I was traveling for work. Aside from not packing well (they’re huge) I don’t think I have a single complaint about the shoe. It’s soft but not completely squishy (for those who have Neo Vistas you know what I’m talking about).

I started using them as a daily trainer but then eventually found some better suited shoes that weren’t as soft, although I probably could have continued to use them as such. These really shine as a recovery shoe or a heavily cushioned DT. 

I always felt pretty confident running any pace from 7:30/mi keeping up with my running groups “easy runs” all the way to the 11-12 minute mile profusely hungover on a Sunday morning. I really never have an issue with my feet getting too hot so I did not notice it with these. The lacing system is great, tongue is comfortable so no issues there.

One thing I will say is that I did spend $200 on these shoes and I sort of expected about 500 miles on them. In my head I have revised that expectation and will probably put them down at around 400 miles, which is still not something to shake a stick at. (This could also be due to the fact I weigh 200lb.)

These shoes were everything people said they would be and more. Don’t regret getting them a bit I just wish brooks was a little better at color ways (I’m talking about the poop brown cw). Jury is still out on if I will get another pair or try the neo zens or cloud nimbus to fill the recovery shoe role for less $.

1jot4n3,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Which daily trainer to pick.,"Hi guys, so I'm currently running about 20-30k a week at about 6:30/km (easy), and tempos go upto 5:15/km-ish. I only started running full-time about a month ago, but I can do this much already due to my athletic background. I'm a very lightweight runner and am mainly training for 10k PBs (currently 53:10) and eventually want to build up to half marathon race distances. I've never really had dedicated running shoes and am in the market for a daily trainer.

I've heard very good things about the novablasts but would probably go for the NB4 just to save that cash, since i don't want to spend too much right now, and would probably invest more once i become more serious.

But the thing is, i could either buy a novablast 4 for 130 USD or a NovaBlast 5 for 160 USD (I don't live in the US). Alternatively, I could buy a nimbus 26 for 100 USD (it's on a very big discount rn) + Hyper speed 4 (60 USD). I know the novablasts are supposed to be incredible daily trainers and the nimbus is not really meant for picking up the pace, but given that i can buy a hyperspeed along with it for a similar price, I'm not sure what I should do here.

I'm also open to any other suggestions you might have in a similar price range.

I spent at least an hour switching between them and running, jumping and strafing around. In the end, I didn't like that the Novablast 5 feel a bit weird when heel striking when jogging. It felt as if they have foam in the forefoot and the heel and a bit of an empty space in the middle, which made it feel a bit strange. Also the fact that the Kipruns were made to do long distances and Novablast 5 more for versatility. So, I decided to go with the Kipruns. I'll try to update after further testing.

Best shoes for Half-marathon training

**Tl;dr: Warsaw, Poland, student, 183cm 72kg, flat feet (possible overpronation), popular running shoes out of stock or unavailable for trying in store, need shoe recommendations - one or two shoes that'll be for any kind of running, but mostly long practice runs and eventually half marathon, maybe more.**

Hi everyone! I have a goal of running a half-marathon. I have no real issue running 11km, except that my shoes start feeling uncomfortable.

The current shoes I use are Reebok Floatride Energy 5 Adventure, trail runners (but I run on pavement mostly).

I never should've gotten these shoes, or should've returned them when my feet weren't comfy during my first run with them, but I hoped they'd get better (and they did, but not that much, and ultimately - not enough).

I am looking into all kinds of recommendations and comparisons from Runner's World and Reddit, and cannot decide. More specifically, this subreddit. I checked out the recommendations here, but the FAQ here recommends 2 shoes, last years if on budget, but I don't know what kind of two shoes? It mentions a daily trainer and a faster, tempo shoe, but which one of these do I then use to run the half-marathon? I'm a bit lost.

I've originally planned for Asics Novablast 5, but now Runner's world recommends Brooks Ghost 16, or Hoka Mach 6 as best for men.²²3

I know that I should just try them on and see which one works best. But, the supplies are scarce and I can barely find any of these shoes online (I'm in Warsaw, Poland), let alone hope for a stationary shop to have them available. 

And while I could order some of these and return them if I don't like them, it doesn't seem productive to spend a couple hundred euro on shoes to try out and then wait for a refund, and I'm kind of on a budget because I'm still a student. 

Some, though, like the Novablast 5, I can only get used on a third party website (there's even only one listing matching my size, and the person isn't even responding to my messages), so trying and returning is not an option :(

I am 183cm, 72kg. I can't even get my foot analyzed anywhere for free (as far as I know) so I can only guess what my gait is. It's even possible that I lean into overpronation because I had flat feet as a kid (and a few years ago I was in a Decathlon store in Slovenia and they had a machine which told me my feet are flat).

I have no specific shoe line that I like and I need help and recommendations. I'm even considering getting a Decathlon-made shoe, such as their Kiprun brand, but what do you think?

I'm leaning towards the AP4 because it is a proper racing shoe and based on the reviews it's a soft and bouncy shoe, but I'm worried I might not be fast enough to maximize the shoe.

The Superblasts and the Skyward are long run shoes, and I'm basically doing a long run effort with my target pace. I'm reading that they're also bouncy, with the SB being a bit firmer.

As the title suggests, I am looking for a good pair of trail running shoes to start more regular trail runs and enter a few half marathon races later this year, but so far I've found the search overwhelming.

I've spent a few hours looking up and reading about different shoes, and as much as I enjoy it, every time I think I found a pair I'm interested in, I see comments mentioning things like heel slippage, durability issues, etc. It's a spiral I can't seem to find the exit out of.

Some info:
- I tried on the Adidas Terrex Agravic Speed, but the toebox was too narrow.
- An all terrain sole will probably work best (I'm situated in Cape Town, South Africa... lots of rocky terrain, field and trails).
- I enjoy speedy shoes, but also want it to be suitable for easier runs (both short and long).
- Durability is important as I want it to last long.
- Not sure how I feel about a plate or too much cushioning as I want the shoe to feel snappy and versatile on the trails.

I've looked at the Saucony Peregrine 14 & 15, Asics Gel-Trabuco 15, Nike Zegama 2 Trail & the Mizuno Daichi. Any of these I should consider or stay away from? Perhaps something else completely like a Hoka?

Now, let me preface this by saying I understand ‘most fun’ or bounciest will be subjective to most, as weight and ideals will change for each person.

I’m simply looking for a shoe that really bounces along and throws you forward. I’ve tried things like the Rebel V4 but due to my weight, I just compress the foam and don’t get much of anything in the form of energy return. I have a pair of Novablast 5’s for daily runs and a pair of 880v12’s that I use to beat up for road to trail running. Both pairs are in wide width.

I’ve heard amazing things about the Neo Vista but I’m worried my wide ass foot won’t work out with them. I know the Supercomp trainer is also an option but I’ve heard it’s less fun than let’s say the Vista. On the flip side, if the SC trainers are the only things that will fit nicely, then my choice is clear.

If anyone has any suggestions here it would be greatly appreciated. Everyone else is out having fun in their super foams and I just want to join in on the fun.

Something that would keep my feet from fatiguing and that would just give the maximum amount of comfort possible.

My current shoe is NB 1080v13 which I have used for everything from speed workouts/interval training to easy and long runs. I even ran my first half marathon with them. I feel like they're starting to approach the end of their life.

I have now bought a pair of Adizero Evo SL's which I'm intending to use quite a lot, but perhaps with a focus on faster workouts. I would like to buy another pair for my rotation which I would primarily use for easy/recovery runs and long runs.

For context, I am a heel striker who's experienced some minor knee pain in the past which I have worked on with a physiotherapist. It has helped a lot, but I'm wondering whether a new shoe might also help mitigate any possible knee pain/discomfort in the future. I'm just guessing here, but perhaps the instability/lack of support of the 1080v13 might play a part there?

I’ve been looking for a new pair of daily trainers and decided on the Novablast 5 after reading several reviews. I tested a size 44 in store, and while they felt okay, they were a bit loose at the heel. Since I prefer a snug fit, I ordered a 43.5, thinking they would be perfect.

However, after reading some posts here, I’m now second guessing my decision. Considering foot swelling and movement while running, could the 43.5 be too small? I typically run 5Ks and occasionally 10Ks, so I’m not doing long distances.

Would my snug preference make the 43.5 a good choice, or should I size up for a bit more room?

One thing to note - the 43.5s are the color I want and the last pair in stock. The 44s were the last available in a different color/store and might already be sold out. So part of me wants to keep them just to avoid waiting for a long restock...

1jnc5qb,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Thoughts on Adizero EVO SLs for my first marathon?,"Finally got my hands on the Adizero EVO SL a few weeks ago. I’ve put about 90 miles on them so far, including a mix of tempo runs, intervals, and a 19 mile long run. I was blown away by how easy my pace felt on the long run in these, half of which was at my target marathon pace. I also felt like my feet recovered quicker than normal and I was able to walk fine that day and the next day. Basically, I realized the trainers I’ve been using up to this point sucked and I’ve been doing this all wrong.

So why am I hesitant to use for a marathon? For one, the adidas website brands these as intended for medium runs (up to 12 milers). Second is that these shoes did make my right foot blister and bleed a bit on the top of my foot. I felt some discomfort at the base of my big toe at around mile 12 during the run but powered through it. I suspect these were still being broken in because I didn’t have the same pain during a 14 miler this past weekend.

Despite some of the discomfort, it honestly felt worth it for how good I felt on and after that run overall. I couldn’t find any other posts of folks running marathons in these so wanted to get thoughts or feedback from this community on whether this is a wise decision for my first marathon or if there’s likely to be a world of pain waiting for me after 21+ miles.

1jn8u39,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Best shoe for impact absorption and ankle stability following ankle reconstruction,"Hi team,

Long-time on-off runner here, looking to get into the sport a bit more seriously.

18 months ago, following a fairly serious ankle injury, I underwent a right ankle reconstruction.

I’ve been slowly building my weekly mileage and (touch wood), things are finally starting to feel a little more comfortable when I’m out there giving it a go.

I’m looking for some suggestions for a new pair of running shoes. Currently own a pair of Brooks Glycerin 21s which seem to go pretty well for me.

I do mostly road/pavement/path running and it’s most important to me that impact absorption on my ankles is minimised as much as possible. I guess ankle support is also something I’m looking for in a new running shoe.

My main goal is to continue sustainably building my mileage - not looking to break any records, just want to be able to continue running for longer periods with as much impact absorption and ankle support as possible.

Appreciate any suggestions/advice.

Cheers

1jn88yt,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Is there a brand that makes shoes that never seem to fit you?,"I recently bought a Gel Kayano 30 and after a bunch of runs I started getting blisters on my inner heel. I started readin about this type of blisters, because they were kinda uncommon and it looks like plenty of people seem to get them with various Asics products, Gel Kayano being the most common one.

When I tried them in the store, they were great. Even after the first few km's they were ok. This all made me wonder If I will ever bring myself to buy another pair of Asics, knowing that this seem to be an issue across different models. Clearly a lot of people love these shoes but it makes me wonder if Asics as a brand has a structure that will never fit my feet.

1jn87bd,AskRunningShoeGeeks,[Sizing Help] Adizero Adios Pro 4 vs EVO SL – How do they compare?,"Hey everyone,

I could really use some advice from runners who have experience with both the Adidas Adizero Adios Pro 4 and the Adizero EVO SL.

I currently use the Adios Pro 4 mainly for racing. When I bought them, I had to go significantly up in size compared to my Boston 12s — the fit was way tighter, especially lengthwise. That sizing difference caught me off guard, so I want to avoid the same mistake again.

Now I’m looking to get the EVO SL as a lightweight training shoe, but they’re not available in any offline stores near me, so I’ll have to order online without trying them on.

For those who’ve worn both:

How does the EVO SL sizing compare to the Adios Pro 4?

Is the fit similar in length and width?

Did you have to size up/down or stick with your usual Adizero size?

1jn44dm,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Asics Kayano 14 vs Gel 1130 first try,"Many were praising the Gel 1130 over the Kayano 14 for ""comfort"" and ""cushioning"". So I had to purchase both to try for myself. (Silver/black is Kayano 14 and Grey/silver is 1130)

And I can tell you first hand that the Kayano 14 feels way more comfortable with more ""cushioning"" both in terms of the shoe base comfort and the impact absorption. You can feel it when walking around. The gel 1130 doesn't provide the same impact absorption.

Also, the inside footprint of the gel-1130 is smaller due to the smaller insole as seen in pics. (I'm guessing for cost reduction). So overall, another thing that makes it less comfortable for me.

I have no idea why so many kept saying gel 1130 has more cushion, because it doesn't seem that way for me. But anyways that's my observation. I'll be returning the gel 1130 and keeping K14

Is there anything better than Kayano 14 for walking, regardless of brand? I've heard of Nimbus 26 and Hoka but that's for running and I think too much foam is good for running but not great for walking, correct? ",2025-03-30 03:49:43+00:00,0,9

I am currently using Asics gel galaxy 8's that appear to fit like a glove, however I doubt these shoes are any good as they were bought 5-8 years ago or so as just gym shoes and have sat in storage since never used (Till now!)

I am looking for good value for money shoes and have no budget besides this, I rather not spend 200 on minor marginal gains if I could spend for example 130, or 80 and get shoes that will be more then good for my needs.

The distances I will be doing are 5k for now and eventually 10k, the pace I am attempting to set is 25 and 50 minutes respectively (Hah... That might change to be a bit slower).

I do about 3 running workouts each week including a general cardio session in the gym/outside (Depending on weather), though all my running is done outside primarily on paved roads and shell/dirt paths.

As for my foot shape I find it hard to say, I have never really paid... Attention? I feel like they are normal shaped, but I might be wrong, I fit in most shoes fine though some on occasion can feel a bit cramped.

I am size 42-44 europe, my Asics gel Glaxy's 8 (What a mouthful, hah) are size 44 and my main shoes (mephisto jeremy) are size 43.

As for my footstrike, find it hard to say once more... I think it might even differ between my legs, I feel like my left leg is heel, middle, front, whilst my right leg is heel, middle. 

I am sadly unsure about pronation, I did find a old pic of my shoe soles before they got replaced: [https://imgur.com/a/e36PDAW](https://imgur.com/a/e36PDAW) It seems to have higher wear at the heels and possibly the toes (But I am a bit of a toe walker when not running)

As for shoe weight, too new to have a preference? I suppose light is better, but given the whole ""Value for money"" I imagine that might be a thing I have to sacrifice a bit on.

I suppose preferred feel is much the same as above, I think I'd like something a bit more of a soft ride? But if people here based on what they have read go ""Firmer is better"" I don't mind.

Surfaces I mentioned above, but they are paved roads, dirt roads and shell roads

1jmthn9,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Replacement help for New Balance Prism v1 for person with rough feet/ankles,"Hi all,

I just threw out my men’s 8.5 NB prism v1s—the first shoe I’ve ever really liked. I have decently flat feet and have a long history of rolled (destroyed) ankles with now limited ankle flexibility and not super stable. Also been working through achilles tightness/soreness and with my latest shoes some plantar fasciitis. I’ve been working on strengthening my arches and try to run with a midfoot strike and try to keep my arches high the whole time. I worry about having too high a stack height and base that will cause me to turn an ankle too easily. I liked the drop of the prisms.

I bought a pair of 8.5 Saucony Tempus which felt pretty good to run in but something about the sole was making me nervous I’d turn my ankle (I think the width in the forefoot combined with it being relatively stiff) and I eventually did while walking home from the store after a run… promptly returned those shoes to REI. I then tried the latest NB 880s in a sz 9 recommended by a running store last week. Those felt good in terms of the ankle rolling (not sure exactly why) but gave me bad plantar fascia pain in both feet so I returned them for store credit. 

Does anyone have any insight on what might features I should be looking for given these couple data points? My suspicion is that stability shoes might actually be too stable for me and are what risks the ankle rolls, but this could be wrong. Not sure about the fasciitis issues. 

Also, is it a bad idea to buy a used pair of prism v1s on poshmark? I just want to run again, it’s finally become fun and the weather is getting nicer.

Haven’t run in the ES4 as reviews seem to indicate it’s much closer to the 3 than the 2. 

Anyways, I know I’m not the only one who has been chasing that feeling of lightweight, responsive, snappiness that was the ES2. Has anybody found anything that’s close?

Some super trainers and uptempo shoes I’ve tried:

Boston 12: firm and fast; a good shoe to be sure but too wide and lacks the pop

ES3: a jack of all trades, master of none

Puma DN2: an S-tier daily trainer, which I use for most of my long runs. But lacks the pop and feels heavier. 

Takumi Sen 9: only run on the track with these. They’re just kinda fine. They fit a half size too large and I often wonder if I’d like them more if they fit better. 

PX2S: too heavy and crowded in the toe box. I wonder if I’d like these more if a half size up. 

Puma DN2E: fast, light, but too firm. Not much pop.

I have been trying more than 30+ shoes the past month to find one that fit my feet.

I finally found the Brooks Glycerin 22 and have been walking in them the past two days. Everything good so far. Can you recommend a shoe which has a similar sizing/contour? 

Although my feet arent ""traditionally"" wide, it appears I struggle to find shoes that fit them correctly. Brooks/Saucony appears to have good baseline fit for my feet in general. In other words sort of wide forefoot, but a narrow midfoot if it makes sense. Neutral shoes are preferred, I have a very slight pronation on my right foot I am working on.

Now, I would like another shoe I can alternate with the Glycerin simply for flexibility, longevity and feet health purposes.

I do not plan to run with them, if I do it will be short runs. I will primarily use both shoes for everyday wear/walking in a city/office.

Hence a complete black version or similair discrete color options are must.

Brooks Ghost 2 max

Saucony Hurricane 24

Asics Kayano 14, 31

Have been running in Brooks Adrenaline GTS (12mm drop) since 2012. Had dealt with shin split issues for most of my life up until switching to the Adrenalines, and they gradually went away over the years -- running amount has ebbed up and down but was always in the range of 3-6 miles/run and never ran two days in a row. I really dont want to invite shin splints back into my life...

About this time last year, I was turned on to wide toe box / barefoot shoes for casual wear and have been wearing Xero Nexus Knits ever since for basically all occasions other than running: around the house, to the gym, out and about, etc. Simply put, I love them.

Past 2-3 weeks I've started to deal with (assumed) mild plantar fasciitis / some achilles soreness that's coincided with A) pushing baby stroller 3-4x/day for total over 3-4 miles and B) throwing a 30lb ruck pack on my back 1-2x/ week to try and get some extra exercise out of all the baby walks.

Stopped running the past 2 weeks given the PF/achilles and went to running specialty store where my arches was confirmed mid-to-high, I was recorded running on the treadmill and tried on a few different shoes/brands. Walked out with two pairs of 5mm drop Topos: Phatom 3 for running and Cyclone 3 for walking + advice on altering my running gait to avoid over running/heel striking.

Based on what I've read, typically you transition over months from a high drop shoes to a lower drop shoe. But given I've been walking in zero drop minimalist shoes for the past year, how should I approach transitioning to running in 5mm Topos?  
(Running every other day 5-6 miles, and about 1x/week swap a jog with interval training Norwegian 4x4)

I started off as a heel striker but have strictly forced myself to forefoot due to knees. I've been mostly running the DNE2's which has a lower stack height and less toe lift, it was very easy to switch into forefoot striking with this while the NB4 seems like either the stack height or just the more aggressive toe lift or rocker front felt more unnatural.

It's also definitely easier on the calves to use the DNE2. I'm wondering how much this has to do with the carbon plate or just the way the shoes are designed overall?

I'm going to start using the NB4 now that I can actually put in some running volume without fatigue in the calves anymore with the DNE2. I know it's not advised to use carbon plates as trainers but the DNE2 sure helped me to get used to forefoot striking like training wheels if you'd consider it that.

Note. I got the NB4 first, I saw a good sale and style for the DNE2 I liked so I figured I can try a carbon plate on a shoe I would actually wear for the style anyway. I'm not going to be buying any new shoes until I wear down the NB4's which will take awhile.

1jm5jj5,AskRunningShoeGeeks,My rotation between trainers and racers,"
Do these shoes have the same foam, or does the adios 9 have AP 3 foam?

Also rate the designs.

Context:

I use the Adios 9 for daily training including speed sessions and long runs.

Why?

Because it’s an absolute must when it comes to running form, speed and light weight. 

The low drop and minimal foam (which was not considered “minimal” just 5 years ago), make it perfect for a good forefoot strike. 

The pro 3 is a beast as well. Amazing durable shoe. I can’t tell if the Adios 9 and the AP3 have the same or different foam? Some YouTubers said they are. Others said they aren’t.

I believe the head of adidas design said it be adios 9 has AP 4 foam.

Anyways. AP3 and Adios 9 are a great combination.

* Preferred feel: Open to ideas 
* Surfaces: Road

Background:

I have been using ASICS Gel-Venture 6 since 2021. They have been my all-around workout/lifting/running shoe. I get pain in my ankles and knees after runs, so I started looking for something better.

Fleet Feet suggested Brooks Glycerin 21 (size 14, D width). They felt ok in the store, but when I ran, they felt too big and unsteady, especially around corners. I returned them and tried New Balance Fresh Foam V5 size 13 (D). These fit much better. I really enjoyed them, especially how my easy on my knees and ankles, except they felt significantly slower than my Gel-Ventures. I think I understand now how these are intended for easy/recovery runs.

Next, I tried adidas Adizero Evo SL size 13 (D). These felt a little wide in the front, but I tightened the laces. I loved the way they felt as I ran and was able to run further and faster than ever before, but I had soleus soreness in both legs afterward. Advil took care of it first day, but after the second run I was really sore for days - like hobbling around. I wasn't sure if maybe I needed to condition my soleus, like perhaps the pain might even out over time if I went easy on it - but it was pretty intense at times, so the Adizeros went back.

Now I'm hoping for an idea of what to try next - something that will help me continue improving on speed and distance, but that is a little easier on my knees/ankles than the old Gel-Venture 6s. I'm a little wary after the Adizeros (also - I still feel new to running and would love to understand why they caused pain when the others I have tried did not).

Here are some potentials I have come up with so far, with questions, but please let me know your thoughts or other shoes to consider?:

* Should I give NB 880 V15s a try, since the Fresh Foam V5 fit well?
* Should I give the ASICS Novablast 5 a try, since the Gel-Venture 6s fit me well and cause no pain?
* Should I try Puma Deviate Nitro 3 or Velocity Nitro 3 since Puma tends to run narrow?
* Maybe the Nike Zoom Fly 6?",2025-03-28 14:32:46+00:00,1,9

I have two related questions. I ran a lot in my mid/late-20s, was pretty mid (like 1:50-1:55 half), but at a time when people put considerably less thought (and money and plates and rods) into their shoes. Moved away from running to do a lot more strength training, but now have been (slowly) trying to get back into it. My problem is I am pretty sad in most running shoes. Have tried the Nimbus 26 and Bondi 8 when I thought that my old self might need more cushioning, but those were dreadful—running shouldn't be that hard. Tried the Deviate Nitro 2, but wanted a little more oomph and stack.

Along with them I also ordered the **Nike Zoom Fly 6** (on sale for €134). Now I'm wondering if I should use this kind of rotation or just stick with the EVO SL for everything.

Rotation:

* Easy/daily: EVO SL
* Tempo/Intervals/Race: ZF 6

I also considered using the EVO SL for daily/easy runs and intervals (due to its lightness) and the ZF6 for tempo runs and racing. What do you think? I'm open to any advice. Thanks!",2025-03-27 11:40:11+00:00,13,12

As the title suggests, I'm tossing up between the:

* Nike Pegasus 41
* Nike Invincible 3
* Nike Vomero 18

Currently running in a pair of Nike Free RN Flyknit 2018 long overdue for replacement. I previously liked having the closest shoe to bare foot as possible, but now almost 40years old, possibly need something with a bit more cushion. Saying that I don't think it would be a great idea to go too extreme the other way, as I walk around bear feet most of the time (work from home).

I usually run (jog) 3-5km around the suburban streets mostly on the footpath. I get hot feet, so ideally one with ventilation. US Size 9.

Open to other suggestions too, however I've always liked Nike shoes.

1jkzdxf,AskRunningShoeGeeks,No love for the Novablast 5? (daily/recovery shoe suggestion),"Hey everyone, I've been benching the NB for a while now because I believe they're not for me and for I want them to be (mostly recovery shoes). I was happy when I bought them as they felt comfy and fitting out of the box. Unfortunately, almost 200 km later, they just won't do (there were some runs where I felt I had bricks instead of shoes on, plus other bad sensations — first time something like this happened to me as I get along with most shoes).

They suffer the comparison with the Evo SL (450 km), which I love and believe are a far superior shoe, in all aspects.

I'm definitely considering getting another Evo and using them for everything, which is what I'm doing currently. Otherwise the shoe that caught my eye recently was the Mizuno Neo Zen (just cannot justify getting this over the Evo for the same price).

Anything else worth considering together with the Evo? Should I give more time to the NB? Would be nice to hear from those who have the same shoe rotation or used both the NB and the Evo. Thanks!",2025-03-27 08:42:22+00:00,11,31
1jkv129,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Biggest shoe mistake you ever made?,"Let’s learn from each other’s collective failures. What’s the biggest shoe mistake you ever made?

Mine was the Saucony Freedom ISO. At the time I didn’t know anything and thought running shoes were just good - better - best, and I thought the Freedom ISO was better than the Saucony Rides I had been fitted in by Fleet Feet because it was the first shoe with Saucony’s EVERUN foam. Didn’t realize the low drop wouldn’t be a good fit for my tight heel-striking calves, or that it had a low stack that wasn’t a fit for the longer distances I was running. Just thought I was getting a great deal on Amazon on a better shoe. And I went WAY too many miles before deciding my beat up sore legs weren’t just because the shoe was taking a long time to break in.

1jkidke,AskRunningShoeGeeks,First Marathon Shoe recommendations - Superblast or...?,"I'm training for my first marathon, which is likely to be at the end of this year, and I want to look into what shoes I should consider. A regular suggestion seems to be the Superblast 2, which I'm heavily considering. I typically run in Asics shoes as is, but I'm open to suggestions. I just got back into running last summer after a few years off and am up about 40 pandemic lbs.

General stats;

33M 5'11"", 215lbs,

10k time these days \~1hr 10mins. (approximation. I haven't run an all-out 10k attempt in years)

I am flatfooted and overpronate a bit. I don't think to a dangerous degree.

Current rotation;

Kayano 29 for easy and long runs—they feel very supportive and well cushioned, but I have some issues with arch pinching on rare occasions, leading to mild blisters.

Noosa Tri 15 for tempo and speed—I'm enjoying them. They're light on the feet and turnover well. There's no real pop, but they feel reliable.

I'm not the fastest runner these days, but I'm working on getting my 10k time under 1hr.

My question is, should I go for the Superblast? I feel like I will need something well-cushioned and supportive for my first marathon. If so, what type of lifespan do they seem to be getting? 500+miles hopefully? Assuming I only use them for long runs, how does the foam age over time? Are these the type of shoes I could theoretically use over the course of like 2 years?

What other suggestions would you give if I don't go for the Superblasts?

I saw that the Asics S4+ are now coming to the US. that's certainly a tempting shoe, but I want to see more info on it.

I know some people are comparing the Adidas Evo SL to the Superblast, but I'm not sure if it's a good shoe for marathon distance.

I have been looking for a narrow shoe that will not leave my toes swimming in the toe box but no luck so far. My toes slide around and have to grip to stay in place which ends up cramping my toes and arch of my foot. I tried to provide an artists' rendition of what I experience in shoes so far. I have tried the following:

\-**Adidas Boston 11s (standard width)**: very loose, my toe tips got bruised and blistered from banging around in the toe box.

\-**Brooks Ghost 15s and 16s (2A narrow width)**: very loose and too spongey (?), my whole foot felt like it was sliding around. The narrowness seemed to be in the arch, but the toe box was too loose.

\-**New Balance Women's Fresh Foam X 860 V14 (2A narrow width)**: somehow looser than both the above shoes? Too loose around the arch and waaaay too loose in the toe box. My toes have to 'grip' within the shoe to stay in place so my feet keep cramping.

All of these were sized correctly and are not too large, I promise. I even tried 2 different sizes of the New Balance ones and the smaller size were too small, I ended up bruising my toenail because of it lol. I played soccer growing up so I think my feet prefer something like cleats that are very very tight to the top of the foot.

I have been running for decades (68f), sometimes a lot, sometimes only a couple 5K-10K a year. I also work out regularly (Crossfit, HITT, lifting, Cardio, etc) I have shoes for the gym, which sometimes crossover into running. I am in athletic shoes 99.99% of my life, including working as a nurse.

Over the years, my feet have widened. I can no longer wear many brands I used to love. (Nike, Asics, Brooks, Puma, Adidas) Spring, 2021, I went to a well respected running store to gather new recommendations. I found myself moving up from my normal 5.5 size to a 7 in the Saucony Kinvara 9. LOVE this shoe, bought 2nd pair in 2022, felt great from the start.. Also that year, I fell in love with the Altra Lone Peak 3. bought 2 pair, one for working, another for trail running/hiking. LOVE. Fit perfect from the start. I also found and No Bull trainers and the Everyday Runner, again, fit excellent, right out of the box.

I've been running, hopping, jumping, spinning, working, etc, pain free, and joyously in all the perfect shoes purchased in 21 and 22.

Spring forward to March 2025

Went to running store, learned Altra had sold out to a new manufacturer. Tried on Topo, Altra and Saucony. All felt good in the store, ran around the little track several times in each pair. What I hated was the thick cushy sole of each one, but they all felt good on my feet. I chose the Altras because of my past experience and my fat feet.

I also purchased the exact same model of the No Bull that I purchased in 2022.

I go out for a short run of about 2 miles in the Altras. I AM FREAKING dying. My feet are numb, plenty wide in toe box, but tight across the bridge. Next day, my hamstrings are killing me. I have NEVER had this problem. So I decided to wear the Altras to work to ""break them in"" Four hours into my shift I am exhaused,, depressed, my feet are killing me. Luckily, I keep a spare pair of ""emergency shoes (like slippers!) in my locker, I'm Immediately feeling better.

I tried the No Bulls after work, just to feel them out. Same thing....numb feet, tight across the bridge of my foot.

I don't notice the bridge tightness till I'm into the run, on both shoes. I went to YouTube to find lacing options. Tried one that was to address my problem. Re-laced both Altra and No Bulls. NO CHANGE over the next 2 runs. Both shoes going back.

I talked to my ortho nurse running friend. She says that the thick cushy soles prevent us from feeling the road so we actually land harder, trying to find it...hence my sore hamstrings.

She suggested Xero, wide toe box and high bridge. I have chosen the Xero HFS II and they will arrive today. I have never run in a barefoot shoe but I here I am about to try.

I have an 8k and a 10k coming up in less than a month. Do I really have to wear my worn out Kinvara 9s because they DO feel the best?

I just don't know how to navigate the change in both my feet and the shoe manufacturers.

[background]
I've been on this sub frequently as I have never once been interested in running shoes, until now. I'm a new cane user also using compression socks and sometimes a back brace. My new physical therapist recommended i get some good cushion shoes like running shoes. I've gone to REI, every shoe store in my nearest mall, and searched everywhere online for deals and I am lost. I have a heavy step and I'm a bit unsteady, so my feet start to hurt very quickly when I walk with normal Nike or Adidas shoes. 

I (size 8 men) like the Brooks Glycerin 22 the most with the Hoka Bondi 9 coming in second. I've tried a couple types of the New Balance Fresh Foam ones alongside the 9060s. I'm mainly looking for a good cushion but ones I can still feel the ground a bit (like the Glycerin 22), that way I know when my balance is off when I step. The toe rocker on the Bondi 9 was life changing, making it easier to step and not scuff my heels. I love the Bondi mostly for the look (thick sole and doesn't immediately have that running shoe look) while having a great cushion. Though the sole is way too thick and other later models don't seem to have that same cushion. The NB were a good mix of both, taking the lead in aesthetics. Trying to find a wider shoe.

Are there any shoes (running or not) that has that stable, but plush cushion (perhaps a good insole could solve this issue?) of an older model of any of the mentioned? Or just anything else? The $200~ price point with no chance of sales any time soon is tough, but there has to be similar shoes from past years...right?  Preferably I'd like it to have a bit of a unique form or color way that doesn't give that ""dad on a stroll"" look lol. Share anything you've got, I'll go later this week to try on more shoes before committing to anything. ",2025-03-26 04:11:30+00:00,1,0
1jk3b3b,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Looking for Advice on New Running Shoes,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking to buy a new pair of running shoes for my upcoming races and could use some feedback on potential options. Right now, I’ve been running in a really old pair of Nikes, but it’s definitely time for an upgrade.

My upcoming races include a 50K trail run (mostly on grass and some single track with rolling hills—nothing too technical), a 10K Spartan race, and a Spartan trifecta weekend.

Most of my training runs are on the road near my house, but I also have some nice trail running areas within driving distance.

I’ve been considering the Hoka Challenger 7, Nike Pegasus Trail 5, and possibly something more trail-focused like the Speedgoat 5 or Zegama 2. My main question is: Would a more trail-oriented shoe be a bad choice for road running? Or would these options still work well? Should I be looking at a more hybrid road-to-trail shoe instead? I know a hybrid would likely be the most versatile, but I also want something that will serve me well for future ultras.

For reference, I wear a size 8.5 and have a relatively narrow foot, so I don’t need a wide-fit option.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!",2025-03-26 04:06:54+00:00,2,1

I am a 25 y/o female that weighs 220lbs. I wear size 8 + wide in womens. For as long as I can remember, my shoes have never lasted a long time. Most of the time, it's due to my insoles getting ruined in the same spot no matter what.

The attached photo is of the insoles of my Wide Hoka Clifton 9s after less than a year of use (got them in July 2024). If it were just the insoles, I'd get a replacement, but the outsoles are also falling apart and disconnecting from the shoe. I don't generally have a lot of mileage - my average has been less than 7k steps per day for the past year.

I am finally financially in the position to buy a new pair of shoes, but would like to hear thoughts from others before buying. Currently I'm eyeing the Asics Kayano 30s as they are on sale and available in wide (and I am a bit flat-footed). I would love to hear anyone else's experience with this sort of wear and tear in their shoes.

Unfortunately, this last time I tried to submit a replacement under warranty, I found out that they now require you to ship the damaged sock to them. This is very disappointing since previously, the process involved providing the order information for the sock and a picture of the damaged sock for a warranty repair. Many, like myself, purchased Feetures products under the thought that they’d buy a pair once and not need to pay to replace it (other than paying for shipping for the replacement pair, which is fine). For this reason I won’t be purchasing any of their socks anymore and hope this helps anyone not aware of the policy change to the lifetime warranty.

I ran a half marathon last Sunday in my new AP4’s.  I ran a tempo 10K a week ago and they felt great.  Also, felt good for the race. However, when I woke up Monday morning and stepped out of bed, walking was very painful on my right foot.  Pain was midfoot outside.  Between the cuboid / Metatarsal area, roughly.  Mainly under the foot but also a bit on top. Tried to run Tuesday and it felt really bruised on the outside of my foot and I had to stop after a few steps.  Initial panic I had a stress fracture.  Anyway, it’s get better, day by day. Still a bit sore,  but I think I bruised something.  Not sure what, but seems odd as no pain when running on the day.  

It’s the only shoes with rods and if I press down on the insole, some areas feel quite stiff. I assume these are the rods.  As the shoe is soft between the rods, I was wondering if it was maybe my foot pressing into the rods.  But I’ve not seen this mentioned in reviews or in here.  

Anyone had anything similar?

My SB1 is 45 EU and I have to tie a runner's knot to keep a secure heel lock. Even in long runs, my big toe is fine (photo 1). My long toe has experienced some rubbing (photo 2), but I'm not sure if it was just due to sock thickness or bad foot positioning.

**Should I go for 46 EU?** I heard the SB2 is a little last roomy than the first version.

Bonus question: in case I don't find any in stock in the next couple of weeks (likely, unfortunately), is it too risky to wear my SB for the marathon  considering the wear (photos 3 and 4).

I have pretty bad overpronation and flat feet, and I wear custom insoles specifically designed for flatfoot correction. I'm currently looking for a pair of Hokas that give me that ultra-plush, ""Rolls Royce ride"" kind of feel but also work well with my foot mechanics.

I’ve narrowed it down to the **Hoka Bondi** and the **Hoka Gaviota**. I know the Bondi is known for its max cushion and comfort, but it’s a neutral shoe. The Gaviota, on the other hand, is a stability shoe with the J-Frame support.

My main concerns:

* Will the Bondi be too soft and unsupportive for my overpronation, even with the custom insole?
* Does the Gaviota still offer that plush ""luxury ride"" feeling despite being more structured?
* Which of these handles custom insoles better in terms of fit and comfort?

1jj87nf,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Looking for recommendations for a recovery shoe,"Just recently picked up a shoe voucher, and looking to invest in a comfy pair of recovery day shoes to put no stress on the legs.

1jj5mh2,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Recommendation: Ergonomic shoes w/ Drop,"I need recommendations.

For much of my life I have lived in zero drop shoes (such as Xeros), but I believe that this is now causing issues. I used to be a sprinter and low mileage runner, however I was in an accident in 2014 that left me with neurological damage which causes deficiencies of my once dominant, right side; resulting in gait asymmetries. I have remained in therapy since then and am always working to improve, but due to cumulative, minor injuries over the last few years my shins/ankles/feet have become very sensitive and easily “upset”. And I don’t even run anymore! This is just from daily walking (~5mi) + gym stuff (weight training and calisthenics).

I will give a chronological overview of my notable shoe experience:
- Xeros: the shoes were so perfect for so long. I love everything about these so much and they will probably forever be my “gym shoes”, but I think I now need to change the muscles I’m stressing and protect myself from the pavement when walking a bit more.
- Altura Experience Flow (wide): I absolutely love the footbed of these, but the drop feels insufficient and seems to be putting too much stress of my calf muscles. Additionally, the weight of my heel seems to sink into the cushion too much and put unnecessary pressure on my arches.
- Vionic Winny Sneaker: these were purchased for professional purposes, but they’re pretty great for daily activities. These are not marked as D wide, but Vionic shoes are designed to be very spacious.
- Brooks Ghost 16 (wide): this feels like the forwardness I need to relieve my shins/ankles. However, the foot bed isn’t shaped like a foot and creates a gap of empty space to the outside and in front of my big toes. I said to my mother that the toe box feels a bit like “athletic stilettos”. Do not like that aspect, but love the way the sole feels!

I am fairly certain that I need a shoe with fairly high heel-toe drop (8-12mm?), a wide/natural footbed, and very minimal arch support. I add the bit about arch support because, though I have a very average/moderate arch, I have always found arch support to be painful to my arch (ideally I’d find a relatively firm heel with not much give to the foot bed?). Prior to my accident, I spent a lot of time in various styles of equestrian boots and New Rock “combat boots” with a good, 2.5inch+ heel. My quads are substantial and can handle to increased workload of a greater heel-toe drop.

I’m a 31yo female, 5’7”, 175lbs of athletically stocky build; size 8.5. Although I don’t actually “run”, I do a significant amount of fast paced walking (generally on pavement) and require the agility that running shoes allow. During my gym time, I will continue to wear minimalist shoes. (I would also like to include more plyometric drills, such as skipping during my walks.). I do not have pronation or any other distinct gait issues.

I’m going back to Fleet Feet tomorrow, but I’d to request external guidance. Can anyone offer up recommendations or advice? Please ask any questions that you feel pertinent and I will try my best to respond.

I have been getting back into distance running after a hiatus and need a new pair of running shoes. Plan on doing a half in May. I’m female, have very narrow feet, and higher arches (nothing crazy but definitely on the higher side vs flat). Also have a tendency to supinate. I’m constantly dealing with recurring peroneal tendinitis.

Meant to purchase the Glycerin 22. The guy brought out the GTS on accident, we noticed and swapped them out, and it looks like I ended up buying GTS somehow after all of that…

How do the GTS tend to fare for people with a tendency to supinate? They’re definitely comfortable, but I originally wanted the non GTS for more of a neutral shoe. My research has been mixed so far as to whether the GTS will be problematic for me.

I already ran in them once before I realized, so that’s the main reason I’m considering keeping them vs taking them back. Any insight is appreciated!!",2025-03-24 22:00:08+00:00,1,2

1jiyu4s,AskRunningShoeGeeks,1000 miles (1600 km) ASICS Gel Cumulus 26 replacement advice,"Hello Geeks!

Over the winter I have logged 1000 miles (1600 km) on my daily driver ASICS Gel Cumulus 26s and am looking for advice/ suggestions on replacements.  I have been training for my first marathon and logging around 100km a week in these and they have been phenomenal for all types of runs.  I am 5’10, about 150lbs, wear a size 9 US, and have run in them in all weather and conditions, from 19 minute parkruns to 30km long runs in blizzards they have never failed me and still have a bounce to them when I walk, honestly I’m completely blown away.

Two main questions:

1. Should I even consider switching to something else considering how well these have held up? The continued performance on a high mileage shoe seems other worldly and I feel I could keep running in them, although I would rather replace now than find out I have to when I start to get injured from running in a worn out shoe.  

Is there any shoe on the market that would be a slight upgrade or worth testing out that would have a similar fit? Considering how much I’ve taken to running I would be open to having multiple pairs for different types of runs, potentially something slightly higher performance for uptempo workouts.  

2.  Considering the wear pattern on the treads and the fit of the shoe, what would the community recommend I pick up as a race day shoe? I have tried a number of carbon plated shoes in store and my feet seem to like the ASICS Metaspeed Edge Paris and the New Balance MRCELCW 4 (both tried in a size 9.5 as recommended by store staff for marathon distance and relative fit).  Is there anything else I should try?  Which of these two shoes would the community recommend for marathon distance racing? I am targeting a sub 3 hour marathon in early May.

Thank you for any and all advice, it’s really hard to tell what is influencer hype/ marketing talk when reading reviews of shoes online.  I would really appreciate advice from fellow runners who have run/ raced these kinds of distances in the past!

1jivzz3,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Replacement for outgoing Novablast 4 (Over-supinator/Heavier runner),"Hi - I have slowly been getting into running over the last 12 months and I recently completed my first half marathon.

My workhorse has been my pair of Novablast 4s which I bought when I was first getting into running and I ended up using them for my half-marathon but after that race they just feel dead. I am a heavier runner (Currently 6 ft tall and 195 but I was around 220 when I started running) who is on the slower side (Easy runs at 6:05-6:45/km depending on how rested I am) and they just provide me with very little cushion. Every step is now jarring and the foam has lost its pop. They've got about 450km on them but being heavier I feel like I have worn them out quicker. it's gotten to the point where even on easy runs I am getting a little bit of irritation in the my right knee. 

I have recently acquired a pair of Boston 12s for my tempo work and longer runs with a pace target but I'm really looking for a more cushioned shoe that can chew up my easy miles and easier long runs. I don't necessarily need a shoe similar to the novablast 4 which I wanted as a do-it all kind of trainer. Of note I also over-supinate and I am a mid to forefoot striker.

I've decided on Salomon's because I have narrow feet and with other basic trainers like Pegasus or new balances, my foot would slide around on the sock liner. Now as the title suggests I've narrowed it down to the aero volt 2 and the aero glide 3. My knees have definitely seen better days so cushion and shock absorption is pretty much my main concern. So the obvious answer would be the aero glide 3. The only problem is that I run probably 80% road and 20% trail so maybe the ultra cushiony aero glides would be pretty unstable on mixed terrain. That's where the aero volt would come in. 
 Maybe I'm just over thinking it but I was wondering if anyone has any experience with these particular shoes and could give some insight.

1ji913i,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Comparison question but just between 2 models! And a question on a random brand :-),"Hey folks, happy Sunday. I've found 2 cracking deals in my size 47 for Adizero Boston 12 (£78) or Puma Deviate nitro 2 (£101).

From what I can gather from research, the pros and cons are:

Boston 12 - great energy response, superb outsole for grip, will last for long runs. The only downsides seem to be a longer breaking in period and a few people have found the fit is fiddly, requiring patience to get it right.

Deviate nitro 2 - also great energy response, able to handle longer runs too, as well as shorter. I didn't find much negative comments.

  
Both shoes seem highly rated on most sites and reviews. The Pumas seem better fitted from the off, I guess I'm leaning towards Puma but the Boston 12's seem excellent too.....

Just randomly, has anyone ever heard of Irunsvan? They're a Chinese brand, they have a carbon plate marathon model for.....£62! I thought, given most trainers are made in China anyway by all brands, would they be worth considering? Someone posted them on here before and the responses were mostly positive.

So far I've only had to fit the Adios 9 in store so I would like to know if they fit the same (for people who own both).


Also another question, the length of my feet are 27cm, should I go for 27.5cm or 28cm due to the swelling that will happen after running?


I've had this problem since I tried on Asics Nimbus 27 as well and their size 9US which is 27cm fits perfectly but not the size 9US of Adios 9. So I'm kinda confused with the sizing of Asics too (do they run big?). Btw, I couldn't try on the 27.5cm (size 9.5US) as there as no stock and the next available was 28.5cm


So just to sum it up, please help me finding the correct and advisable sizes for these.


Foot length = 27cm
Foot width = normal to slightly wide


Adios 9 = size 9.5US 
Nimbus 27 = size 9US (could go 9.5 if recommended)

1jhkftp,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Are plated super shoes worth it?,"Hey fellow runners,

I am m/30/75kg (165lbs)and have been training various sports throughout the last 13 years of my life so I can say I'm pretty active physically. I took up running seriously about 1 year back and I don't know how I've lived without running for so long.

To get to the point, I am looking into super shoes as around 4 months ago I threw away my old shoes and got the Novablast 4s (which are now my daily shoes). I understood then that shoes actually do matter (contrary to my belief that it is all a marketing scheme) as it completely blasted my times and my feet thanked me a bunch. 

Now, my paces are not as impressive as probably 80% of the people here but I do my best to improve and have improved dramatically over the past 6 months. I am mentioning pace because I read that it matters in terms of wherether it is even worth bying plated super shoes or not. Some people have mentioned that if you aren't a decent runner it is pointless if you aren't rich. I am focusing on competing in pretty much only 5k and 10k races and training for both types as well. 

5k PR is 22:30
My 10k PR is actually from today at 47:44

I have read plenty discussions here in reddit and a lot of online reviews but still decided it's best I ask all the questions here. 

What do you recommend as a plated super shoe? Would it make sense for me for my running times and would they actually help me improve these times? Are they all relatively less uncomfortable in trade of the added speed? 

Apologies if these questions seem stupid. I am  genuinely interested if what im reading online is even remotely correct. 

What I personally am looking at, are the mainstream options:

Nike's VF3, AF3
Adios 4 pro
Asics metaspeed sky/edge
Takumi sen10

Saw multiple doctors, got evaluated at Road Runner, and I ultimately had the best results with more minimalist and/or barefoot shoes. I don't want to go full barefoot right now due to the initial foot/calf strengthening period required and the pain or soreness associated. Also - I have wider feet and need a roomier toebox.

Tries to land forefoot/midfoot, but over long distance legs get weak and I gradually transition to heel strikes.

I absolutely loved the EVO SL, I'm already on my second pair now, and have used it for everything from slow easy runs to races. Naturally the Adios Pro 4 and/or Pro 3 makes sense. Well... I loved the Adios Pro 4 as well until the rod cracked with \~30km or \~18miles. So I don't want to take any chances with the energy rods in a while.

Does anything exists outside the Adidas ones have a similar feel to the EVO SL or LSP in general?

My experience with other shoes, for reference:

\- Saucony Kinvara Pro is another pair I loved, though it seems to be mixed reviews in the community, but I would think the endorphin pros/elites might be worth a shot.

\- Vaporfly 3: only ran a few times in it, and surprisingly felt that it was plain. My guess is that either I am too heavy, or that because I picked them up on the shelves of Nike Outlets the foam might have loss the pop. Always wanted to give the alphafly 3 a try though

\- Superblast 1/2: I think they are great shoes, but I don't feel the bounce/pop that many people are getting from them. I do feel like the 1st generation is a lot more fun/pop than the 2nd version though, which also seems to be a rare experience. Wonder if the Metaspeed sky paris would be a good idea

The reason why I would buy them is because I used to keep reading on this forum different posts raving about the Triumph line. But that was about the standard shoes not the RFG. So I have a couple of questions for people familiar with this shoes:

1. Is this a good price for the shoes? Keeping in mind that where I leave in Eastern Europe we usually don't have the great deals typical to US. The lowest I price I ever found for the regular Triumph 21 for example was something like 105 Euro (115 USD). So are the shoes worth the price?
2. How different is this model from the standard one without recycled materials? I am only interested in the shoes performance, not it's sustainability. YT Reviewers say that the difference is minimal, but I find it hard to believe. And the price difference gives me pause also. I fear that the shoe is just a significantly worse version with cheaper materials that tries to get away by the sustainable label.
3. Would the shoe be an improvement over my NB More 4 and Mizuno Sky 7? The shoes that I use now for my long/easy/recovery runs? And really like btw.

\*EDIT: i mean magic speed 4, not 3!!

I'm trying to decide which of these shoes I should get for both my tempo training and race day. The context is complicated for a couple reasons.

Context: I'm 6'3, 100kg/220lbs, heel/midfoot striker. 20m24s 5k, 44m 10k, 1h45 HM.

Here's where it gets more complicated; I wear a 12.5uk 2E with my beloved 1080v13 daily trainers, and they fit perfectly. my foot is sort of wide, but more so ""thick"" than just wide. like it's not flat and broad, it's just big.

I'm looking for a shoe that will fill my 2-shoe rotation (1080 for easy/distance, the new one for tempo, 5/21/42km raceday.) This means that I'm looking for the best balance of fast, but also long distance suitable. I understand that that's a big ask, but budgetary restrictions force my hand.

My research (trying on various pairs in store) has suggested that I stick with a 12.5uk and deal with the relative tight fit width wise, but with more research I hope to try more 13's. I've tried a couple 12.5's and a couple 13.5's, no in between yet. Tried on NB Fuelcell Rebel and Propel, both didn't work at all. No Access to Saucony, Nike, Brooks, in my size.

The Boston 12's seem like the perfect answer for my situation, but I tried on a pair of Magic Speed 3's and the fit was simply superior. Novablast 5's seem like another great option, however I'm concerned there's not enough difference between them and my current 1080's raceday wise.

Perhaps the question is simply this: Do i trust my gut, and buy a pair of Boston 12's in uk13? The Magic Speed uk13 might just fit better, but I can't find out due to living in South Africa. Thanks in advance!",2025-03-21 12:18:37+00:00,1,15

- 175cm, 89kg male
- Low arches, heel striker, supinator (based on wear pattern of my current trainers), Greek foot type
- Getting back into running for weight loss
- Struggling at the moment with knee pain (pes bursitis), likely caused by my worn-out Ultraboost 1.0 on hard ground

My Dilemma:
- Given my weight and knee issues, should I prioritize stability + cushioning or go for a more neutral shoe?
- For my knee, I’m already working on knee/glute/hamstring strengthening exercises

Shoes I’ve Tried:
- Asics GT-2000 13 – Felt very comfortable - walking on clouds! Wonder if they have enough cushioning for my weight / strike pattern.
- Asics Gel Kayano – While they were very comfortable, I felt almost off balance in them, and they felt very clunky.
- Considering: Asics Nimbus (more cushioning than GT, maybe they’re less clunky feeling than the Kayano), Saucony Ride, Brookes Glycerin, Novablast (seems to be the best general purpose shoe recommended here).

How’s best to decide between these options? Should I favour stability more given my weight and low arch? How important would more cushioning be?

If there’s anybody who has a similar story, I’d be keen to hear what you picked and why! 

Thanks in advance!",2025-03-20 19:51:40+00:00,3,8

1jfvssz,AskRunningShoeGeeks,"Ghost Max, Tempus, And?","Hello! I'm looking for recs on adding a 3rd shoe to my rotation. Some info - I have a cycling background and have trained 10-15 hours per week the last 4 years. I also ran cross country 10 years ago and cross train with running a bit during the cycling off season. I decided to give marathon training a shot this year. I was aware of people making this transition getting injured due to having the aerobic base to go way faster than what your tendons are coniditoned for, leading to injury. I ramped from 10 mpw in September to 40 mpw in February running 3-5 times per week and subbing cycling and weight lifting on non running days. My lofty goal was to run a 2:55. Threshold pace is 6:00min/mile, tempo 6:40, long 8:00-9:00.

I have 400 miles on the Novablast 4. This shoe slowly aggrivated my tibial tendon over 5 months without me knowing that's what it was. It was set off to full injury from Hoka Mach X2 in my right ankle, and it evetually radiated to the left. Maybe too unstable, maybe first run back from rest week, maybe just overuse, or was it the shoes?

I have been diagnosed by a PT/Ortho that I do have tibial tendonopathy. The last 6 weeks have been spent doing PT, strength work, and cycling. This is the first week I have had no pain, and I am hopeful I am getting better. I have done a few 1 mile runs in the ghost max, but am fully backed off of running for 2 more weeks as directed. I picked up the Tempus on sale at REI for $80, and haven't tried it yet.

Given I have a credit at the store I can return the Mach x2 to, I'm looking for one more shoe. I have tried the superblast, but like the novablast my right big toe rides onto the inside of the upper. I did ty the glycerin max in store and liked it. I am also curious to try the ES4. Thoughts?

  
I may be putting the cart in front of the horse here, but when I got hurt I was starting to become obsessed with the shoes and the respective subreddits, which is why I am asking. Thank you!",2025-03-20 18:27:18+00:00,1,4
1jfuw2x,AskRunningShoeGeeks,"I have seen a Dr, podiatrist, and PT, but I'm still totally confused as to what type of shoe I should be using? Everything I try causes different injuries. (Am not a new runner)","

I have a long history of runner's knee, insertional Achilles tendonitis, and plantar fasciitis. I'm told I have extremely high arches, low heel bones, and very narrow feet. My right leg is a bit wonky- the knee is higher and angled in a bit, while the foot angles out. I often feel that my foot tilts inward while off the ground running and then I am landing on the outer edge of my forefoot. I've been told totally different things on whether I over or under pronate. A lot of shoes, especially soft high cushion shoes, feel unlevel like I am sliding to the outer edge of the shoe. They feel a bit more level without the added insoles but the insoles majorly help my plantar fasciitis and Achilles tendonitis. I was in tons of pain just standing or walking without them for a solid year or so. But I am wondering if they might be messing up the angle of my foot by tilting it. I've tried a ton of shoes and tons of PT as well as a podiatrist and I'm still feeling totally clueless. 

For the last couple years I've been running in Hokas (challenger, torrent, and mach, all with superfeet high arch run insoles), but was always running into knee injuries. The insertional Achilles on my right foot is pretty much always sore too but it's the knee pain that ends up really limiting my running. I thought I'd try out a Brooks shoe with a higher drop but it started killing my heels immediately. So then I tried the North face vectiv enduris for the cushy rocker instead of the high drop, and at first I LOVED them, my insertional Achilles pain vanished and my knees and stride felt good, but after about 5 or 6 miles I suddenly developed a debilitating Achilles pain higher up on the ankle on the opposite leg, and on the next run I injured my posterior tibialis on my good leg too.

I'm so frustrated, I feel like I've tried every type of shoe but have learned nothing and still have no clue what I need as far as cushion, stability, heel drop, rocker. Should I try something different, try Hokas again, try different insoles? Am I not giving myself enough time to adapt to new shoes that are too different? Doctors/physical therapists have given me totally conflicting advice so I'm at a loss. ",2025-03-20 17:49:56+00:00,1,16

AP3s are on a nice discount in my local online store, but I'm struggling to decide on the right size. Since it's an online store, I can't try them on unfortunately

Currently I use:  
**Adidas Adizero SL** (EU 46, UK 11, US 11.5) - less than half a thumb space for the toes - otherwise they sit nice and snug, but definitely too short. I started getting black toenails on longer runs so now I use them only for short runs of max 10-15k.  
**Asics Novablast 4** (EU 46.5, UK 11, US 12) - almost a full thumb space for the toes and overall very comfortable - ran all my 25+ km runs in these last year, including a marathon and never had any issues

NB4 in size EU 46.5 is 29.5 cm in length, but AP3 46 2/3 is apparently only 28.8cm!? So even if it's bigger in size number, it's actually quite a bit shorter! Even 47 1/3 (29.3 cm) is shorter than NB4 46.5 (29.5 cm)...

My regular walking shoes are usually 45 and only last year I upsized my running shoes from 46 to 46.5 (after losing several toenails) so jumping into 47s seems a little extreme and I'm worried they'll be too big.. But logically, looking at the length, I should definitely go with 47 1/3, right?",2025-03-20 09:52:49+00:00,2,4

In past few months I had more an more issues to find well fitting shoes. Some worked/fit really good like Saucony ride 16 oder guide 17. For others the ride was good enough to accept the fit, like the Endorphin Speed 3. AP3 is fitting good with a small hotspot due to the upper. Altra Escalante Racer 1 fits also very well.

1jf47z6,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Is Saucony doing me dirty? (Clickbait but I need help please and thank you),"Hi everyone!

Firstly, I'd like to apologize for the formatting because I'm on mobile. (Also I am reposting this as my previous post was deleted because I hadn't clicked on ""read the rules"" sorry)

Secondly, here's my shoe dilemma. I am a 26 year old woman, 60kg (135ish pounds) and around 5'7 (170cm). As you will see here, I appear to be a Saucony girlie, but I am always open to change.

I started running last June. After my first run, I went to a running shoe store where I was advised to get the Saucony Guide 17 (men's size 42.5). I wear orthopedic insoles because years of ballet straight up busted my legs (lol). I love the shoes, they work well, and I love the width of the toebox as you can't see my bunions!

I eventually got into trail running: I got a pair of Salomon sense 5 (I think? The word ride is somewhere in the name too) and they gave me horrible plantar fasciitis after 2 runs. With that said, I wore them with my insoles (and I got them at winners, so no one helped me through getting the right shoe). After that debacle, I found a pair of Saucony peregrine 13 (women's size 43) and I absolutely adore them. They've been my ride or die this winter, especially for running in the snow!

I am in need of a new pair of everyday runners (I'm not fast enough for proper race shoes, although I'm always open to suggestions as I have a few races coming up), and I was told that I should NOT continue with the Saucony Guide as it is a stability shoe, and stability shoe + orthopedic insoles is a big no no. SO, I ordered a pair of Ride 16 (women's 43) on amazon for an amazing price, and I have come to find that they're quite narrow? They seem to be the same width as my Peregrines, but they squish my toes a lot more.

Thus, here's my question: should I keep the ride as they will loosen up on the sides, or should I go for something else (another Saucony or another brand.. although I've tried quite a few brands and they don't accomodate my insoles very well).

I am currently plagued with the flu, so I can't go to a running store for another few days.

Thank you and have a nice day!

TL;DR I got the Saucony ride 16 after owning 2 other pairs of Sauconys and I find them awfully narrow compared to my guide + peregrine. Should I keep them and hope they'll loosen up, or should I get another shoe. If I need another shoe, do you have any recs?


EDIT: UPDATE NOBODY ASKED FOR
I took the ride 16 out for a run yesterday, and I HATED them. My legs started hurting after 5k-ish, which rarely happens. Today, the outside of my legs is slightly unhappy -- it doesn't HURT but it's definitely bothered. 
So, I am back to square one: trying to find a new shoe (I do also want to mention that, since they are phasing out the guide 17, it's nearly impossible to find a pair in my size! I ordered one last night from a local shop, and they cancelled my order!! I'm taking it as a sign that I should just go in person and try out new models. Worst case scenario, a few stores in my city seem to have the all black guide 17 left, I just find them really ugly :/",2025-03-19 18:38:19+00:00,0,3
1jf3exa,AskRunningShoeGeeks,"Shoes for a teen learning to sprint properly, but doing so on asphalt and grass?","My kids are in their second year of track, and they both really love it. Seems like they’re going to be doing more sprinting this season. Their school does not actually have a track—they practice on asphalt or grass. All of their meets are at schools who do have a track. 

One of my kids is incredibly fast in soccer, and can maintain the same speed as his sibling there, but seems to be having difficulty translating that to track. When I watched him sprinting back and forth in front of our house the other day, I noticed that he’s landing on his heels. I’m not an expert in running, by any stretch of the imagination, but I thought he was supposed to be more on his forefoot for sprints.

I’d like to get him shoes that kind of force him more onto his forefoot—I think, if that will help—but I don’t know what shoes to look at, because I know he can’t run in any traditional sprinting spikes on asphalt. I’d also like to get a similar pair for his sibling for practice, although he doesn’t seem to land on his heels when he’s doing the same back & forth sprint practices in front of the house. 

I bought a pair of the antepes muscle trainer shoes, secondhand, online, for $60-something. But I don’t know if that’s all a gimmick, if they’ll actually help at all, or if they’re better off sitting in the box they’ll be arriving in. Any recommendations as far as shoes or exercises we could do to help him are greatly appreciated. 

I’m not one of those screaming sports parents, btw. He’s always loved running. He’s been doing 5ks and whatnot for fun for years. He wants to do shorter races in track this year, though, bc he’s small, and the kids who seemed to do better in distance last year were all a foot or so taller than him.

We’re also in FL, track season is late spring, and the humidity and heat with his asthma make distance races difficult at that time of year.

He’s a sweet, gentle kid, who struggles socially, and he wants so much to do well in track. I feel like the potential is there, if we can just get his form corrected, or get the speed he has in other sports to transfer to track. And I know he needs different shoes to practice with.

He currently has NB Fresh Foam 880s, Brooks Glycerin GTS, and Hoka Arahi 7s. Has pronation issues, flat feet, but didn’t qualify for orthotics.

I have also looked online for tracks that may be open to the public or students within two hours of our house. Absolutely none exist. And the schools will not let you on them after hours, even if you’re one of the kids who’s unfortunate enough to attend a school without an actual track but be on the track team. I’m an approved upper level volunteer for our district, too—background checked and fingerprinted and all, but it doesn’t matter. I even spent a few days investigating a few locations that were posted on different sites, even though the posts were older, and had zero luck.

The reason why I don’t have 10mi this week on my Superblast yet is that I’ve been using my Evo SL for most of my runs this week as it is softer. I wanted something a bit more leg pampering to help recover from my last Sunday’s 13.11 miles PR. 

2. My race this weekend is not that important to me. I’m just trying to add 1 race per month. I have signed up for a race in April, May, and November, and I have races lined up for July, September and October. My races in May and June, both 10k’s are more important to me. I’m thinking of going for a PR in the April one, when it’s still cool and, depending on my fitness, for the November one as well. So it’s not that important that I set a PR in this race, but I wouldn’t be opposed either. 

3. I’m eager to try my Adios Pro in an actual race, but I’ll have other opportunities. 

I have to make up my mind fast as tomorrow first thing will be my last run before the race. If I want to have 10mi on the Superblast this week, I’ll have to give it the nod tomorrow. 

I know it’s my decision to make. I find it helpful to discuss it with others. Often times it makes decision making easier hearing or responding to questions or observations that others make.

I’m an experienced trail runner, completing a lot of races over the years with the longest being around 60k and the shorter ones around 20k. I’m looking for a trail racing shoe for easy/mild trails however I have bunions but normal width mid foot and heel which makes it difficult to find shoes that work for me. 

Over the last few years I’ve worn only Hoka Speedgoat 5s as I’ve found the upper to be stretchy to not cause issues on the bunions.

1jeou43,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Saucony wide fit when not needed?,"I found a great deal on the saucony guide 17, but ordered a men’s 10 which is a touch too small and 10.5 was sold out. But on a whim I ordered them in a 10.5 Wide as those were available. They’re in the mail to me. 

I fully expect the 10.5 to fit me length-wise, but but what about the width? I don’t have wide feet, and as a traditional train runner my go-to are the La sportiva bushido which are a narrow fit. 

I understand most wide shoes aren’t actually wider just more upper material?

The shoe will be my default road trainer and easy run/recovery runs. I have a different shoe for speed work. And I still plan to spend most of my miles in different shoes on the trails. 

Will the wide fit be just fine, or should I forget about the great price as the sizing won’t be right? ",2025-03-19 04:17:20+00:00,0,4
1jenp0n,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Marathon Shoe Rec?,"[25F 123 lbs] I am desperate for a new marathon training shoe for my race coming up end of April. I have very narrow feet and medium/low arches. I don’t think I favor either side but, if anything, I may over pronate. 

I’ve most recently been running in Hoka Clifton 8, Vomero 17, or some old pegasus as my everyday trainers - I like the cushion on the Cliftons and Vomeros over the pegs. But, the Cliftons sometimes give me a small blister in the arch of one of my feet - they may have too much support there for me. And recently my Vomeros (about 300m on them) have been causing some outer arch pain on one foot so I think I may need something different.

As one last detail in case anyone knows why this could be - in all my time running, no matter the shoe, I’ve always gotten calluses/blisters on the tips of my 2nd and 3rd toes. Sometimes even a bruised toe nail when I up my mileage for training. I’m positive my shoes are the right length but maybe my feet are slipping or I’m clenching my toes? I don’t notice myself doing either but I haven’t been able to fix it.

The first two pairs were wonderful but unlike many of the reviews i've seen, they wore out pretty quick at about 200-250 miles, at which point intervals would cause shin pain when starting a fast rep after rest.

I've had them for a week and a half and they cause immense arch pain but it has been intermittent. On any fast pace (for those who know about it, Repetition pace and Interval Pace) they feel fine but easy and threshold pace causes a lot of pain. At this point they are well over 30 miles in and at a variety of paces so should be broken in. I don't understand it at all.

1jefoyc,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Anyone else feel arch pressure in the Adidas Adios Pro 4?,"I just tried on a pair of Adidas Adios Pro 4 at my local running store, and I immediately noticed some pressure on my arch—it feels like the midsole is really narrow in that area, almost like it’s pressing against my foot. I haven’t taken them for a run yet, just tried them on while standing and walking around in the store.

I wanted to check if this is a common first impression with these shoes and if the feeling disappears once you start running. Does the foam settle in, or does it remain an issue?

For reference, I have wide feet but wouldn’t say I’m a full 2E. My trainer lineup includes:

• New Balance 1080 v13 (2E)

• Saucony Triumph 21 (2E)

• ASICS Superblast (regular width, fits fine)

• Saucony Endorphin Speed 4 (regular width, no issues)

For racing, I currently use:

• Saucony Endorphin Pro 4 (regular width, no problems)

• New Balance SC Elite v4 (2E, but feels too roomy—probably should’ve gone with the standard width).

So, has anyone else experienced this arch pressure with the Adios Pro 4? Did it go away after running in them, or was it a dealbreaker for you? Would love to hear your experiences before making a final decision.

1je8lq1,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Need shoe recs to stop heel slipping.,"Hi! I've been having a really hard time finding good, supportive shoes that fit my feet properly for work. I work full time as a nurse and I'm on my feet a lot. I generally walk 5 miles per shift and I'm standing most of the time.

I've tried a lot of shoes. The best ones l've had so far are Altra and Lems. The wide toe box is perfect as I have a wide forefoot. I've tried the ""regular"" brands in wide width but then midfoot and hindfoot are too big and I can't tie them tight enough to stop slippage.

The main problem is that the Altra and Lems don't provide a lot of arch support. I have very flat feet and have had issues with posterior tibial tendon dysfunction, so l use the thin Sole insoles to correct my arch. Once the insoles are in the shoe my heel sits too high and splits up and down a lot. This wears the back of the shoes out super fast. My last pair of Lems only lasted 4-5 months.

I'm in desperate need of new shoes. A pair of Flux runners just got delivered and my heel slips out completely when I walk.

1jdhq2v,AskRunningShoeGeeks,What next after the Triumph 20 for a slower runner,"History:
After getting into running and absolutely loving my Triumph 20s I'm not sure where to go. It was my first real premium road running shoe having previously run in cheaper Reebok, Nike, New Balances. I also had a few editions of the Salomon trail shoes but ended up falling out with them by the Sense Ride 5.

Current rotation:
Having completely bought into the Saucony magic I now have the Endorphin Speed 3 and Xodus Ultra but want a replacement for my Triumphs.

Request: 
Looking for a new cushioned daily trainer. I'm a slower and heavier runner (90kg) with a shorter stride and higher cadence. I typically land mid to forefoot. I'd like to use the shoe for easy, long and recovery runs as I typically don't like the Endorphin Speeds much above 7km. Although I'm looking to improve my current pace for the longer (up to half marathon) slower runs is around 6:00-7:15 mins per km. What I really loved about the Triumphs was the versatility and ability to run any distance while still feeling fresh and easy on the legs and ankles (have previous injuries). Although not challenging for a podium I would also run any races 10km+ in these so it is a daily trailer rather than pure recovery shoe.

Options:
I'm open to other brands but Saucony generally fit me well, anything narrower than the Speed 3 and it would be too narrow. Bearing in mind the Triumph seems to have changed and I can't find the 20 or 21, these are the options I've seen (all in the same pricing ballpark).

- Saucony Ride 17 or 18
- Saucony Hurricane 24 (cheaper but less versatile, maybe ok at my pace)
- Puma Magnify Nitro 2 (Heard sizing may be a challenge)

1jd5o77,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Clifton 9 Treadwear?,"My brother-in-law is an ultra marathoner, and had sworn by his Hoka Speedgoats for years now. So, when I decided that if he could do that much, I could at least pull off a 5K.

I did that, then a 10K, and a 13.1, and the 26.2. Never really felt the need to pursue the ultra distances that he is addicted to, but do enjoy staying fit and with more energy too. (Plus my acid reflux nearly vanished and clothes were slimmer. All good things. I'd done all of this in the Speedgoat style as well (based on his recommendations). They felt great. Then I broke my stupid ankle. Twice. In one year. (April, then Dec)!

It was not the shoes fault, nor mine, just dumb accidents that were nearly identical (lost just a bit of balance and landed on my left foot wrong at an uneven curb. The worst is they were within probably 500 feet of each other (just different streets). It's become something of a joke both in the family and in the neighborhood. I'm the guy who used to run but now trips down the sidewalk! lol

**Anyway**, since switching from running across multiple surfaces to mostly sidewalks and concrete, I noticed the Speedgoats were not really giving me as much cushion as my now tender feet wanted. So, I naturally transitioned to the Cliftons.

These worked well for a while, but now I am noticing foot soreness/pain after a mere 250mi (400km). The shoes don't seem too worn out based on the beatings prior versions took but my feet are now very sore after walking not even a 10K yesterday. Does this treadwear look like I've over-worn them? (They are a daily walker, so maybe I am not giving them enough rest time as I don't use a rotation like I used to...)



I'd be interested in the collective opinion of those who run/walk more often than me. Does this tread look too worn? Should I keep them in my rotation? Other thoughts?

1jcyyxp,AskRunningShoeGeeks,"Transitioning out of stability shoes, Novablast 5 vs Superblast 2","I’m looking for a shoe to help me transition out of stability shoes. 
I’ve always been placed in stability shoes since I was teenager, thanks to low arches and overpronation, much like everyone placed in stability shoes. I feel with time, this has conditioned my body to use these muscles less and less, and almost worsened the problem? Ive never found a pair that felt “right” in that I always feel to some degree I’m getting pushed or prodded by the shoe in certain parts of my foot and there’s always a component of discomfort and shoe awareness. 
I’ve now been on a mission the last 6 months to fix my weak arch/ankles/calves and glute medius in an effort to help with this. 
I’m also rehabbing a calf strain which is more related to overtraining/underfueling rather than pronation related. 

I’m interested in trying to transition out of stability shoes, in particular after trying on a few models, I liked the way the Novablast 5 felt underfoot when I went into chat to my local running store about this. I want something lighter, bouncier and cushioned. 
However, there’s mixed reviews on how stable the Novablast is. I feel that the pop and rocker/forward motion felt really good and from what I’ve read may actually help with my calf over my current kayano 31s?
The other option I’ve consider is the Superblast 2’s, but don’t think I’m speedy enough for these yet (tempo or workout pace 5-5:30/km, long run/easy 6:30/km or slower). 

Currently running in asics kayano 31s for all runs but these feel flat and really slappy/clunky on the ground. 
I have a similar experience in the brooks glycerin gts, although this feels a smidge lighter under foot. 
Really disliked the brooks adrenaline gts, they felt way to firm underfoot, the ball of my foot/metatarsal heads are quite sensitive and these seemed to aggravate this. 

Currently training towards a a 12k and 14k race, with goal to do a half marathon in the first half of next year.

Variants of this question have been asked before but none of them quite answered what I need. I've run in Cliftons for two years now and they've worked well for me up until now. I do the bulk of my summer training on trails but run roads occasionally, and then on roads most days in the winter. At a lower running volume, I had no complaints. Now that I've been pushing my mileage higher, the narrower toe box is starting to be a problem. I finished my 16-mile run today with blisters on the inside of my big toe and the other toes felt very cramped and unhappy the last few miles.

Budget: Flexible.

Intended use: Ideally this is my only road running shoe in rotation, since I'd rather splurge more on trail options. Mostly easy runs, occasionally speed work (but I'm not that fast!), long runs in the winter.

Foot shape: Relatively normal I think, larger for a woman. Usually wear an EU 44-44 2/3, typically M 10.5ish.

Other: Honestly I really like the Cliftons otherwise, so looking for something similar in terms of weight, support, feel, etc.

Other prior shoes: Nike Pegasus gave me mid-foot pain, for trail shoes I have loved the La Sportiva Akashas and trying Topo Mtn Racers now which were good for their first and only run so far.

1jcqia2,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Tibial Pain and Overpronation:  looking for suggestion about new pair,"Before my injury (about 2 months ago), I was using **Nike Epic React** (5 meta broken), which was my go-to. After the injury, I needed new shoes because my old ones were pretty much destroyed. I decided to try the **Kalenji KD 900 Light Men's** shoes, which are **6mm drop**, and they seemed good at first.

However, I started feeling **tibial pain** after running and noticed that my **left foot overpronates more**, which wasn’t as noticeable before. My left foot isn’t painful, but my physio mentioned it could be a **protection mechanism**. I suspect that the worsening overpronation is likely due to the injury, as my left foot might be weaker, but I’m not completely sure.

So now I'm thinking about changing shoes again. The **Kalenji 900s Light** should be more stable, but they still have the **6mm drop**. Could this lower drop be causing the tibial pain and the overpronation issue? Would it be better to go for something with a higher drop to reduce strain on my tibia and help with my overpronation?

Sorry I used GPT to help express my thoughts more clearly, but the issue is 100% mine.

1jcmylw,AskRunningShoeGeeks,HELP... do I have impossible feet?,"Hi everyone, 

I started running last year and fell in love with it. 

For context, I have Greek feet (2nd toe is longer than the first), that are quite narrow and slim (my ankles as well), yet long (I'm a EU 40.5 woman) which makes finding the right shoe very complicated for me, even day to day trainers or boots.

I went to get fitted in a shoe store and they told me since I'm a EU 40.5 I should be wearing a 41 or 41.5 in running shoes. They told me I shouldn't try ON or Hoka because they are usually for wider feet. 

The ONLY shoe that has worked for me is the Novablast 3. I tried the gel kinsei max and Nimbus 25 and 27 from asics, 40.5 was a better fit in the overall foot but my 2nd toe was touching the front, then 41.5 was fine for my 2nd toe but gave me blisters because my feet were dancing inside. Btw I wear the right running socks and the shoe store employee showed me the way to tie my laces in order for my feet not to move inside, but I still got blisters. 

I'm looking for comfortable shoes for long runs (2-3 hours) yet responsive enough...

I tried New balance fresh foam evoz and fresh foam 1080 but I felt very heavy in them. I got very used to the responsiveness of my Novablast 3 and I use it for tempo, intervals and long run as well. It's quite literally the only running shoe I have. 

I tried the Novablast 5 but to my horror I realized they made the shoe wider somehow, and the front is rounder, which means my 2nd toe is now touching the front of the shoe when it's not the case for my Novablast 3 with the same size.

Any tips or advice would be highly appreciated because I am lost.

My current shoes:

My current favourite shoes are Novablast 3 and Mach 5 - I love them because they disappear underfoot, they're lightweight but not stiff, they have a bit of bounce (or more of a rocker in the Mach's case) that propels me forwards, and they work at a variety of paces. However the Novablast in particular have a lot of miles on them, and I'm looking to replace them in the next few months.

About me:

I'm a 50kg, small, female runner, whose pace is a lot slower than it once was (injury)! More of a ""hobby jogger"" focusing on 5ks and 10ks while I build my base back up, but I run 3-4 times a week. I don't want anything crazy unstable since I have a history of injury - I'm working with a PT but my Achilles isn't what it used to be. I *think* I'm a midfoot runner, but doesn't everyone!! I need a bit more space at the toebox (mach 5 isn't great for longer runs actually).

What I don't like:

I recently bought 1080v14, but I'm getting hotspots from them being a bit too soft under the ball of my foot. I think I prefer something a bit more grounded. I also own supernova prima which is great sometimes but too slappy/stiff other times - it doesn't work consistently at all paces.

 * Recently bought Hoka Skyflows for joint pain & mild overpronation. Love the cushion/spring, but arch rub and stability concerns. I'm not against keeping them, I just think there might be a better option.
 * I'm overweight which is adding to joint impact as I'm increasing my activity.  Mainly walking paved areas, but I want to start casual hiking. 
 * Tried ASICS Novablast (cushy, but lacks stability similar to the Skyflows). But I've heard they're more durable than Skyflows, and they are slightly cheaper.
 * Considering ASICS Dynablast (possible compromise: less spring, more stability?). I haven't tried these on and would need to order online, so I'm just working off reviews and online comparisons right now.
 * ASICS GT-2000 recommended for stability, but concerned about responsiveness. I haven't tried them on yet, but there is a store nearby that I can try them at if recommended. 
 * Looking for shoe recommendations that blend cushion/spring/responsiveness with good stability.


My feet are wide which has ruled out many options. I tried on Kayano 31s and they were ok, but no spring/responsiveness like I'm hoping for. I've tried several Brooks styles and haven't been a fan of any.

I tried the Boston 12s in store and didn't like the lace situation and they didn't really hold my ankles well. The endorphin speed 4 were good, and the store guy recommended the Nike zoom Fly 6 and I really liked them too. I am still hesitant about using nylon/carbon plated shoes since I'm not that advanced into running I guess, but the Endorphins and the ZF6 did feel great.

Should I just get something like the NB1080s (I tried them and they were good), or the Novablasts (they don't have them available in any of my running stores so I don't think I can try them on sadly unless I buy them and then return), or go for the plated shoes? This would be for daily training (10k-18k) but also for the race. I am running another half in June so will keep training with these shoes. Thank you for the advice!",2025-03-15 23:37:47+00:00,1,2

1jc783x,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Race Shoe Recommendations with similar feel as ES3?,"Hello there,

I'm looking for a race shoe recommendation for my upcoming half marathon in May, targeting a finish time of 1:35-1:40.

My current shoe rotation consists of:

* Saucony Endorphin Speed 3 (all-rounder)
* Hoka Bondi 8 (easy runs)
* New Balance SC Elite v4 (races)

Although I already own the SC Elite v4 and enjoy running in it, I find the midsole a bit too soft for my liking and also have had issues with heel lockdown. As a result, I'm planning to purchase a new race shoe to replace the SC Elite v4 and use the SC Elite v4 as a tempo shoe going forward.

A bit about myself is that I'm a cadence-style runner and I'm looking for a race shoe with a firmer midsole than the SC Elite v4. I really enjoy the speedroll technology of the Saucony ES3 where I feel I can push the pace and was wondering if other runners have found a race shoe with a similar on-foot feel.

I plan to visit a local running store soon where they have some selection of race shoes, including:

* Saucony Endorphin Elite 2 (heard the midsole is quite soft)
* Saucony Endorphin Pro 4 (heard mixed things about this shoe)
* Metaspeed Paris shoes (based on Asics description, the Sky would suit me better)
* Hoka options (Cielo X1 2.0, Mach X2, Rocket X2)

Unfortunately, the store does not have the Adios Pro 4, Nike, Puma, or ON options. I'd love to hear any recommendations from you all!",2025-03-15 22:46:10+00:00,1,3

Over pronator with flat feet, like a lot of us was told to wear stability shoes from my running store but have since transitioned to neutral shoes with some strengthening (and I sometimes wear Currex insoles for longer runs). 

Bought magic speed 3s as my first carbon plated shoe 18 months ago when I was ramping up training but didn’t really know much about shoes - they were much cheaper than the alternatives. I love them - light, snappy, fast, reasonably stable (annoyingly narrow midfoot but have some stability side walls). I then learnt that they didn’t have premium foam (FF blast instead of FF turbo) and have been read quite a few times that the new foams probably contribute to the recent improvement in racing shoes more than carbon plates. I was therefore disappointed and thought I could improve my times even more by buying proper racing shoes.

I’ve since tried the vaporfly 3s and AP3s and even though they are both amazing shoes, I don’t think for me there is much difference between them and the MS3s for me for distances up to HM? I even tried a comparison with treadmill intervals and they all felt reasonably similar at fast paces. They are also, to me, faster than the ES3s that I have tried which have premium foam but only a nylon plate. I almost don’t want to try the MS4s as they look like quite different shoes.

Can you guys think of any reason for this? Could the FF blast work particularly well with this particular shoe? Or maybe my body/mechanics just prefer lower stack? I know I shouldn’t overthink it and just enjoy running in them but I’m intrigued - let me know your thoughts, thanks ",2025-03-15 17:28:51+00:00,22,19

I just picked up a pair of Vongo V6 because I was looking for a shoe with a similar plushness to the Gel nimbus 26 but with a slight support frame to correct my over pronation.

So I brought the shoe home and I’m realizing now that you are able to see my pinky toe bulging on the outside of the vamp.

I tried on the widely available ones (Alphafly3, Adios Pro 4, etc) at a couple stores but couldn't pull the trigger. The AF3 and AP4, as well as New Balance's new marathon show, felt pretty awesome, but still couldn't pull the trigger. Eventually I ended up trying the Hoka Cielo X1 2.0, and holy crap, those shoes just want to rip a fast pace. It is another level of aggressive compared to the previously mentioned shoes. I did love them, but had some second thoughts due to people saying how unstable they are (they are very unstable, I felt it on my first stride but adjusted quickly). Are there any shoes I didn't mention with a similar aggressive/propulsive feeling the Cielo X1 2, but with a bit more stability? I'm this close to buying the Cielo's but thinking that I should maybe play it safer for my first pair of super shoes. FYI, I am pretty firmly a mid foot striker, (less so on my left foot), have a slightly wider than medium width foot, currently doing daily training in the Nike Invincible 3's and planning to run no slower than 6:15min/mi in the shoes. Planning to only use these for race day, up to half marathon distances. On a side note, do Mizuno's Wave Rebellion Pro's have a similar sensation to the Hoka's? Have heard these are another very unstable super shoe.

1jbphu4,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Looking For New Running Shoes After L5 S1 Spinal Fusion," I am 2 months post L5 S1 TLIF surgery and am looking to get back   
into running after another month or 2. I used to run in Nike Free's.   
Have been for the last 15 years. However, the doctor tells me I need   
more cushioning on the feet to lessen the impact on my lower back. My   
feet are pretty flat and doing various ""foot"" fits in shops, they   
suggest shoes with more arch support. I need shoes with a heel tab that   
is not too high nor hard. I tried running in older Pegasus Flyknits   
before the Free's and they ended up digging a hole in my foot near the   
achilles tendon.  
    
I pretty much do just treadmill running followed by weights at the   
gym so a pair of shoes I could use for both would be ideal without   
having to bring a pair for running and another for weights. I used to do  
 2 days of HIIT runs for 30 mins at a sprint pace of 16 kmh at an   
incline of 2 for 1 min followed by resting off the treadmill for 40s;   
also 2 days of 30-40 mins of just running at 10 kmh at no incline. So I   
guess not really a lot of running by most standards  
    
My shortlst so far is:  
    
Asics GT-2000 13   
Nike React Phantom Run Flyknit 2 - these felt closest to Nike Free's but with more cushion  
Nike React Infinity Run 4  
Hoka Arahi 7  
Hoka Mach 6  
NB 860  
    
I was interested in trying On but the local stores do not carry them in my size which is on the small side.  
   
If the above do not provide sufficient cushioning, please let me know. Any other suggestions appreciated.

What are some of the options I should be looking at for a marathon race day shoe that’s 4e and neutral? 

Most of the shoes I’ve tried are recommended for longer runs, often recovery because of their cushioning. Which is fine, but I’m wondering if there’s a shoe that’s oriented to racing that I’m missing.

So for reference I run about 65km/week (M28 5’ 8” 154lbs) right now but am increasing a little each week. My weekly long runs are a 25km easy pace (5:20/km) and I was using my NB fuel cell rebel v4 which has been my go to daily trainer (zoom fly 6 for speed work/faster runs and AF3 for races and when I just want to have some extra fun on my speed days) I’m finding that after 18km the fuel cells really start to hit a limit for me and become very hard on foot and feel like they offer no cushioning anymore. Browsed through the FAQ here for the list of good long run shoes and am stuck between the

1jaz4ts,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Firmest midsole shoes available?,"
Hi all,

I’m looking for the firmest midsole shoe available, even if it’s a trail runner.

Basically I run a lot of treadmill miles and find that the cushioned treadmill base combined with standard cushioned shoes absorbs too much impact, leading to detraining of some muscular endurance aspects.

So basically does anyone know of shoes that will make my adizero SL runners seem soft? 

Super budget Adidas run Runfalcons or Duramos maybe?

1jaww3r,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Benched runner with recurrent PTTD seeks stability shoe so I don’t completely lose my mind,"Hey everyone, I’ve recently been benched due to a flare up of the bane of my existence (tib post tendinitis) and need to find a decent stability shoe or I’ll go nuts.


I thought I beat this beast so I got massively overexcited and bought some amazing new neutral runners (endorphin speed 4, Cloudflow 4 and Superblast 2 - and no, I didn’t need all 3 but it’s been a journey ok) but 2 months in my old friend is back despite orthotics and lots of PT. Turns out I probs should have eased back into running life with a stability shoe. I LOVE the shoes I bought, I just get to stare lovingly at them instead of use them rn 😭


So I’m taking a few steps back and going for a boring stability shoe that will need to do double duty for walking and running. The problem is I’ve got weird feet and I’m finding it hard to find the right shoe.


Pls send help/advice/anything before I spend all my money on shoes I don’t wear!


- Me: 35yo F, 55kg
- My feet: flat, narrow, low volume. I overpronate and have a bunion. I have awesome custom orthotics so don’t really need arch support, more medial stability.
- Things I like: rocker sole for my sexy bunion, a firm-ish shoe, ideally not massive stack height, 6-10mm drop


Shoes I don’t enjoy: kayano, ghost, adrenaline, Tempus 2, nimbus, cloudflyer 5, most Hokas


Shoes I am ok with but don’t love: gt-2000 (maybe not enough support), ghost max 2 (comes up too high in front of ankle)


Shoes I am considering: 
- On cloud runner 2
- Saucony hurricane 24


The cloud runner is a nice basic lower stack shoe but is a smidge wide for me without my orthotic - unsure if that defeats the purpose.
The hurricane is super comfy but a bit clunky and oh so high off the ground. I also felt like it fought my orthotic a bit- too much stability action? The new guide 18 isn’t available where I live currently.


If anyone has other suggestions I’d love to hear. 


Side bar: If anyone on this feed has beaten PTTD please send me some positive words cos I’m feeling a bit down about it 🫠",2025-03-14 05:41:09+00:00,2,9

I’ve been using Hoka Cliftons exclusively for the last few years for casual running up to half marathon races. My current pair has 220 miles on them, so I’m expecting to need new shoes ahead of race day.

Before just ordering another pair of Cliftons to start rotating with, is there value in rotating with something different? If I were to buy 1 pair, should it be oriented towards speed work runs or a well-cushioned long run pair? I know there’s value in going to a local running store but also would ideally take advantage of online discounts vs full price in store.

My longest run so far has been 13.2 miles with weekly mileage 25-40 miles. Typical pace ~9:30-45 mile and aiming for 4:30-5 hr marathon time, so I don’t believe I’d be looking for a carbon/speedy race shoe

1jaanjp,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Breaking in Superfeet Insoles - High Arch vs Medium Arch? Pain normal for high arches at first?,"Hey everyone,

I'm currently working with a PT for foot pain related to slight pronation issues. My PT recommended Superfeet insoles, specifically mentioning I have a high arch (which other professionals have told me before as well).

Following their recommendation, I purchased the high arch version, but I'm having some issues. The arch feels like it's digging into my foot - almost like a hard ball in my shoe that hurts with every step. I can't imagine running in these if they feel like a rock under my foot.

I tried the medium arch version which feels more comfortable. I can still feel my feet pronating with the mediums, while the high arch does help control that better (despite the pain).

I'm thinking about sticking with the mediums for a while since my long-term goal is building the right muscles anyway. But I'm second-guessing myself:

* Do Superfeet insoles typically need a break-in period? Should I have given the high arch more time?
* Has anyone else experienced pain with high arch insoles that eventually went away?
* If insoles hurt right away, is that usually a sign they're not a good fit, or is some initial discomfort normal?
* Anyone successfully use medium arch support for pronation when high arch was recommended? My PT did say that if it felt like it was digging into my foot to much and hurt, that I should try they mediums.

Honestly they served me well. I searched to just buy a new pair but skechers had updated the shoe. The new one is the Dantay Parral Bungee SR. Despite my old ones being a 9.5 and the new one needed to be an 8 to fit (crazy), they caused so much pain (I did try all the sizes in-between, several Amazon returns later oof). I have never returned worn shoes before but these were so painful after over a week. I decided that good shoes are worth it even tho they are expensive. 

I tried on the Asics Gel Nimbus 26 and 27, and found that in the Wide 9 felt amazing when I put my insoles in them, and bought them.

Today I'm feeling massive regrets, as these shoes have fabric uppers and I'm feeling paranoid about gross stuff that could spill on them. My old shoes were leather or synthetic leather so I never worried about it, I could just wipe it off.  I also weigh a lot of yeast extract and if you know anything about that, it's a powder that gets EVERYWHERE and is sticky.

Can I water-proof/resistant them with sketch guard? I feel like it won't work. 

I had tried on the HOKA bonding SR but the gel nimbus were so so so much more comfortable. 

Are any of the gore tex asics women's shoes as comfortable as the gel nimbus? I feel like it's the PureGEL insole that must make them so so comfortable, but looking at all the models none of the gore tex models have them. My store didn't have any of the goretex shoes. (Do they sell the insoles separately? )

Additionally, none of the goretex shoes come in wide, which felt the best when I added my insole. Are men's asics similar enough to women's wide that I could look into those?

I tried calling asics customer service but they only have options for help with orders, not shoe advice :c

If anyone has any advice on shoes for a lab worker that I can wipe clean and be comfortable for standing and walking on concrete for long hours, I would so appreciate whatever you have to say!

1j9urfi,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Long run easy pace shoe for a road ultramarathon (50miler),"Hey runners!

I'm looking for a long run, easy/slow pace, road shoe for a 50mile looped ultramathon.

Right now, I only run in Saucony Tempus as my everything shoe, and it has held up great for long runs up to 15 miles, but I'm starting to feel the lack of cushion as I'm a forefoot striker. Guy at the running store said I slightly overpronate which is why I got the Tempus, before that I was in glycerin 20s and while those shoes ate up the miles, the drop was too much for me and they were really clunky. I've tried the Triumph 20s and they are absolutely awful for my forefoot strike and it felt like it was pushing me to heelstrike.

About me: 5""4', 130lbs, F, 30-60 mpw

zone 2: 11-12 min / mile

Shoe fit: I have pretty narrow heels so I have to pay attention to the heel lock and always use a runners knot even in the tempus. Other than that pretty normal! High arches and still not sure if I actually overpronate or not since I lasted a year (500 miles) in the glycerins with no issues when I was getting started into running. I've had a few pairs of the tempus for the last year (800 miles) and no issue!

Based on specs and reviews I think something with less than 8mm drop and more than 25mm forefoot cushion would fit, I'm looking at:

* Asics Novablast 4/5
* Asics Superblast
* New Balance 1080 v13/14
* Saucony Shift 3
* Saucony Guide 17
* Saucony Ride 17
* Saucony Axon 3

I included a table below with specs on each shoe including price, weight (oz), drop (mm) and forefoot cushion (mm) based on the runrepeat reviews.

Any recommendations or other tips? I'm not looking for a fast shoe, just one that won't go flat after 20+ miles! Or if they all do then I can look at switching shoes during the ultramarathon at mile 25.

Thanks!!

1j9to73,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Replacements for New Balance Freshfoam 1080 v12,"Over the past couple of years, I’ve been on a mission to find the most comfortable running shoes for walking around. One of the first pairs I picked up was the New Balance 1080 V12. At first, I wasn’t impressed—they felt heavier than expected given the design, and the foam seemed firmer than I had hoped.

Then the 1080 V13s came out, and right out of the box they felt significantly more cushioned and impressive. But over time, I’ve actually grown to love the V12s way more. Once broken in, they feel just right—the cushioning strikes a perfect balance, and they’ve become incredibly comfortable. By contrast, the V13s, while softer, sometimes feel *too* cushioned, to the point where I worry about ankle stability. Plus, the upper on the V12 is more breathable and comfortable than the V13.

I'm a beginner runner (current pace around 6:45/km).

The consensus seems to be that beginners should master proper running mechanics before relying on plates.

Despite this advice, I'm really tempted by the SuperComp Trainer. Reviews indicate durability concerns with both models, though at 60kg, I'm hoping this may be less of an issue for me. Should I just go for it?

**Current Rotation:**
- **Adidas Adizero SL** (340 km)  
- **361 Flame 2.5** (320 km)

**Context:**  
My Adizero SLs are two years old, and I recently suffered a metatarsal injury after a one-hour easy run in them (9:00/km pace). Meanwhile, my 361s are still performing well, aside from some outsole wear at the heel. It’s been a fantastic all-around shoe for me. All of my PRs were set with it.

I’m a relatively slow runner but working towards completing a full marathon by the end of the year. Here are my current PBs:
- 5K: 29:34  
- 10K: ~1:05
- 16K: ~1:48

Next month, I’ll be going to Japan, where shoe prices are much cheaper. I initially planned to buy a carbon-plated shoe (either the MS4, Yogiri S4, or something from Mizuno. But after my injury with the SLs, I’m now considering retiring them and getting a new daily trainer (e.g., Novablast 5 or Superblast 2).

The problem is, I can only afford one pair. I was set on race shoes because I wanted to see if having a non-Chinese carbon-plated shoe would make a difference. But many of my friends have the NB5 and keep telling me to get one. After doing some research, I saw concerns about durability. People say it loses its bounce after 200–300 km, which is disappointing. That’s why I’m leaning toward the Superblast 2 now(if I get lucky and find it in stock) but I’m unsure how well it would perform for shorter daily runs too.

So here I am—caught between too many options with only one slot to fill. On one hand, a solid daily trainer might be the wiser choice, especially since I’ve had great success with the Flame 2.5 and could easily get the Flame 4 (an upgraded version with a carbon plate). On the other hand, I’d love to try a high-end race-day foam and just pick up a cheaper trainer to replace the SLs.",2025-03-12 06:19:17+00:00,6,10

1j93yg8,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Do it all/Vacation shoe - Freedom ISO2 replacement?,"
Hi all. Looking for help finding a replacement for the Saucony Freedom ISO2. Put over 500 miles of running into them over the last few years as well as probably 500+ miles of walking. Roads and local single track trails. The lugs are shot, rubber is totally smooth on the bottom. As I understand it, this line has been mostly discontinued by Saucony.

It was a great vacation shoe. Don’t need to pack anything else. Could walk all day and run in it without much concern. Run roads and non-crazy trails, can also hike. Toes can stretch out a bit in them as well. Also wear them to dinner without too much shame. 

What I liked about the shoe: 

- 4 mm drop 
- very unstructured upper (feels like a sock) 
- very breathable upper - liked the isoknit 
- seemingly very durable outsole (rubber not foam)
- doesn’t really feel like a hardcore running shoe with overly squishy foam or an aggressive toe rocker. 
- looks good/not too goofy looking.

Other shoes I have: 

- bought Nike Pegasus 40s: feel way to cushioned and narrow. Really messes with my arches if I walk all day. Also not super enjoyable to run in either. Should have done a bit more research before purchasing these. 

- endorphin speed 1, 2 and endorphin pros: great running shoes, pretty bad for walking. Saving these solely for running

- endorphin shifts (1 & 2): clunky, ugly, but saving these for longer slower stuff when I get back into it. Are great for what they are but also pretty tired of them (my 4th pair of these at this point, would probably not get them again unless I really ramped up mileage) 

- Salomon predict hike gtx boot: Midtop waterproof. Actually don’t think this would be a bad running shoe if it was lower. Bottom is a bit stiff and the waterproof thing seems like it wouldn’t fit my needs here. 

- Kinvara 11s: been a while but I chewed these up pretty quick. Maybe only made it 400 mi. Idk if the newer versions are improved. 

————————————————————————-

Anyone have a recommendation for a minimalist-ish but also durable shoe with a rubber outsole that isn’t super ugly? Pure running performance is a bit secondary here. Willing to look outside Saucony if anyone has a recommendation. Would go try anything on obviously before settling.

1j8vlq5,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Difficulty with Asics Superblast 2 sizing,"Hi all!

Just tried on the superblast 2's in EUR size 43.5 and 44 and am not sure which to pick!

For starters, I have the novablast 4's in EUR 43.5 and they fit quite snugly (about half a thumbnail from my big toe), and the sides of my feet held snugly by the upper of the shoe. After longer runs I've noticed a bit of pain around the top of my 2nd toe (is this normal though?), and this is what got me considering going up half a size. This was my first running shoe and I've had this for a little less than a year. Now, I'm thinking of picking up the SB2 for longer runs.



So I tried on the superblast 2's on EUR 43.5 and 44, and found that the SB2 in size 43.5 fits the length of my foot similarly to the NB4, but is a little tighter on the sides. On the other hand, the SB2 in size 44 is a lot more roomy (a little less than one thumbnail of space at the big toe) with comfortable room for the sides of my feet than my 43.5 NB4s.



Store clerk said that both sizes are workable choices for me, and the decision ultimately comes down to preference between a snug, tighter 43.5 fit (for more grippy feeling?) or a looser 44 fit (for more comfort?). I'm a little confused now since the store clerk mentioned either size is OK.



Is my experience with longer-run discomfort from size 43.5 NB4 enough reason to go up to size 44 in SB2? I'm uncertain because of my inexperience with running and running shoes in general. Please advise, thanks a bunch!!

I’m planning a comeback for this July. It’s been almost 10 years since my last race and I’m training for a 10K this July (aiming for a 50 min time since it was my PB at that distance 10 years ago). I’ve been training on Nike Invincible Run 3s with no problems. I have wide feet on the mid foot area so back then I basically had no choice but to wear stability shoes. But during the 10 year break I’ve forced my feet into walking/running with an arch (largely thanks to insoles) which I think explains why I haven’t had any issues with the Invincible Run 3s. Visited a store today and fitted the Adizero Adios Pro 3 and was impressed at how bouncy it was + when I asked if it was Neutral or Stability, the guy at the store said neither and that it could cater to both. Any other shoe recommendations that offers a similar mix of bounce + good for both stability and neutral feet? 

PS - I’m a lot heavier than I was 10 years ago but a lot of it is muscle mass since i’ve been more focused on weight training for the last 5 years",2025-03-11 08:04:18+00:00,1,3

I go to university 4 days a week and usually fit in around 6k-12k steps a day. I also do weightlifting 2-3 times a week. My current shoes are some Nike Air monarchs, but they're starting to fall apart on me.

I'm 5'9, 220lbs (working on it), a size 9 mens in 4E, and I have orthotics for my flat feet. I've been looking around a lot of places for shoes that fit 4E, and I've come up with this list:

1) new balance 1080v14, I've tested these in store and they just feel like they push you forward on each step. That being said, the ankle support felt a little weird (maybe because I'm used to hard leather shoes), and I'm not too sure if the tread is good for everyday use.

2) asics nimbus 27, also tried these out in store and they felt super comfy to walk in, not sure how good of a pick this is for everyday use.

3) asics kayano 31, tested these out and they felt harder than the 2 above for sure, but not uncomfortable. Overall felt very solid.

4) hoka bondi 9, felt right in between the kayano and 1080, felt like a good middle ground.

I've also tried out the new balance 990v6, and 880v15 and didn't really like either, they both felt like very solid shoes but I was looking for something with more cushion. Although now that I've looked around a bit walking shoes shouldn't have as much cushion? Not sure.

I haven't tried out any other new balance really, I'm a little curious about the 840, 860, and the leather 928. Also curious about brooks, haven't looked into those too much.

My budget is around $200 CAD, I'm located in the greater Toronto area if that matters. I also plan for these to be my only pair of shoes due to a tight budget. Any help choosing or other recommendations would be appreciated!

TLDR: need new shoes in 4E for everyday use, no serious running (yet).

This weekend, I had a 20 mile 'race' that I intended to do entirely at sub 3 pace, I finished in 2.15 which is all good but felt the same issues coming to bite towards the end (Despite taking salt capsules/electrolytes this time) and unsure if I'd have made it much further. This time I wore Saucony Endorphin elites (Only for the 2nd time) Which felt brilliant but I've read they can be pretty tough on calves so was purely curious if it's worth considering something a little more forgiving such as pro 4's, which I've heard aren't quite as firm.

I'm aware that this is mainly a physiological/nutritional issue but I'm wondering, purely from a shoe perspective f this could be one small factor in potentially preventing cramp during my sub 3 attempt.

1j80wo8,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Half marathon Saturday,"
Hi all, 

I’m 24F, size 9, about to do my second half marathon in DC. Ran XC in high school. Super injury prone: recently had IT band issues. 

I have trained in the saucony tempus and new balance 860 for 5/6 years (since HS). I don't love either but they’re the ones I like most. I don’t like the saucony ride at all. My issue with the tempus: I want more cushion but like the support and stability. I tried the hurricane and hated them. The 860 is fine, I light how lightweight it feels, but also sometimes wish for more cushion. 

I ran my first half marathon in November and wore an older edition saucony endorphin speed, and I HATED it. No carbon plate. They were okay for the first 6-7 miles, but then around mile 8 I wanted to take them off. My right food felt like it was rocking to the right and arch hurt. My feet generally felt like they were swimming around the shoe (and they were my normal size).

Couple questions: is there a best race shoe for stability runners? And, if so, should I get them for this weekend? One idea I have is that I make my friend wear my normal tempus' and if anything goes wrong I switch with her. Or, do I wait until my next half marathon? Not trying to break a world record or anything, but think a race shoe would be fun/beneficial!

1j7ym6y,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Is there any running shoe that has a profile with a completely straight lateral side of the sole?,"TL;DR: Title

For reference: The cloudmonster 2 was almost straight enough, but sadly didn’t cut it

Here are an example of hourglass/dip-shaped shoe (which never fit) and a shoe with a straight side: [https://imgur.com/a/d7MvKGM](https://imgur.com/a/d7MvKGM)

Story time:

I have always had issues finding shoes that fit, and would often spend hours trying on shoes in stores, to much dismay of my mother.

As an adult, I now only waste my own time on this apparently futile endeavour. However, six months ago, I thought I had found the solution – minimalistic/barefoot shoes.

The problem has always been midfoot width, and this genre of shoes just seemed to fit the profile! The solution was minimalistic shoes for everything except running as I like a bit of cushioning here.

This was a bad idea.

Now my feet have grown even wider, and I cannot find any running shoe whatsoever that fits my foot shape – they all cause pain on my peroneal tendon. By now, I have had thousands of Euros/dollars worth of shoes delivered in Extra Wide, 4E, and what have you - only to return them right away due to poor fit.

I have noticed a trend, that the listed width of the shoe is not necessarily correlated with how well it fits me. While wider shoes of the same model fit better, it seems, that the shape of the model is the most important factor. Especially shoes with less of a ’dip’ in the middle are better options. Looking at my minimalistic shoes, they all have a straight lateral side, while most running shoes have some weird hourglass form (see picture).

Since ”width” and ”wide midfoot” seems to cause all sorts of misunderstandings, I would now like to rephrase the question I have asked so many times before:

Is there \*any\* running shoe that has a profile with a completely straight lateral side of the sole (while still being somewhat wide)?

And yes; I prefer running shoes with cushioning. I know, I can run in minimalistic shoes, but I simply prefer the foam experience.

Note: I need the shoe to be straight the whole way down to the ground: both the outsole and insole must be straight. If one is straight without the other, the support does not the go the whole way down, and will still cause pain in the long run.

1j7tkzd,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Non plated bouncy and aggressive shoe for half marathon and above,"I recently completed my first half marathon in Adios Pro 4 and after 15K, soles felt kind of dreadful. I’m starting to believe that super shoes are not for me (84kg weight with a 80kg target, 1m86cm height, average pace around 5,20/km, half marathon time 1h55m). Therefore, I m looking for shoes without carbon plates and thinking of prioritising cushion and bounce rather than plates. My plan is to run a marathon in the end of this year and progress to ultras by next year. Almost 48 years old if it is useful to know. 

I already have SB2 which I tried on a 11K race which I completed in 1h02m. After the race I run another 7K on recovery pace and legs felt fresh. During the race, I didn’t feel like plated shoes would make me faster vs SB2. I don’t know if the SB2 made my legs feel fresh or the recovery run immediately after the race though. 

So my thought is finding a shoe that will give me the max bounce and cushion possible, without being too soft like the AP4 and maybe more bouncy and cushioned than SB2. I already have NB4 but they are near their end of cushion life after 350km so I wouldn’t wear them on a race.

I’ve been looking for a race day shoe for my upcoming half and tried the Hoka Mach X2 and Brooks Hyperion Max 2. The Mach X 2s were way too harsh/stiff and unforgiving; the Hyperion Max 2s were slightly better but were still stiffer than I liked. I’ve been eyeing the Adios Pro 4s because the lightstrike foam and the carbon rods seem like they might be a more forgiving ride than other plated shoes. HOWEVER—if I didn’t like the nylon plates in the Hoka and Brooks shoes, is it still worth it to try the carbon rods? How does the feel of the rods compare to a full plate?

I see a lot of posts about the undercarriage durability, but not the foam. My NB4s felt like they were losing bounce after 150 miles and honestly felt dead at about the 250 mark. 

With that being said, I really enjoyed the NB4s. I am now in the market for a new daily trainer and am considering the superblast 2s in hopes the foam will last a bit longer.

My question is, does the SB2s have a longer life than the NB4/5s? It would seem that paying 50 extra bucks is super worth it if I can get nearly twice the life out of the shoe than the ladder (which a lot of people seem to not be talking about when complaining of the SB2 price).

Long winded post, sorry yall.

I moved back to Kayanos from Novablasts as I need a stability shoe for overpronation and the neutral shoe started causing tendinitis as well as plantar. I had the 28s before (and 22s before that) but hated the 28s. I got the 29s and they worked great for me, I even ran my first marathon in them and put almost 800km into them and they’re still actually not too bad (but retired to walking!). I then got the 30s and they are just as bad if not worse than the 28s. I have blisters all along the inside of my foot and they appear at anything over 6km. They don’t feel as stable and there is absolutely no grip on a wet day.

I took a brief hiatus from asics a couple of years ago and bought Hokas. Worst idea ever. They absolutely wrecked my feet. I got the 29s then and they were the best thing ever.

Long story short, are there any shoes out there with the same fit, support and feel as the 29s in order to save me from injuries and save my bank account from trial and error on lots of different brands.

Side note: I wear good socks (usually feetures or balega) but nothing saved me losing toe nails at the marathon!

As the title suggests, I'm a bit on the heavier side when it comes to running (192cm, 94kg). Currently I'm using Pegasus 41, and for someone like me, who previously used shitty Karrimor shoes, they are wonderful, first time running felt like a dream. Problem is when I run longer distances, say 12km and up - I start feeling my feet getting beat, especially If I'm running at easy pace (which is 5:45-6:00 min/km for me).

Currently I got my eyes on a few pairs of shoes, that would probably fit my parameters of being comfortable for longer distances, durable (durability is a priority for me), and maybe even handle one or two races. My current Pegs 41's are 350km in, but only minimal signs of wear on the outsole, so I guess my running form is okay'ish?

My feet are normal width (regular pegs fit me just fine), I dont over pronate, I run around 35-40km per week, run almost exclusively on road.

Currently I got my eyes on:

Nike Zoom Fly 6 - as I understand they are one of few affordable supertrainers, and are also very durable.
Nike Vomero 18 - max cushioning, more roomie, without carbon plate but still with decent foam and energy return.
Asics Novablast 5 - couple of my friends who are even heavier (around 100kg) say these are ultimate shoes for heavier guys, but I'm a bit concerned about their durability in the long term.
Adidas Adizero Boston 12 - read somewhere that their upper is not so durable, but they offer great energy return without the carbon plate.

Yesterday I went to a running shoe store and bought the Asics Gel-Pursue 10. The employee asked me about my previous shoes and looked at me jogging for a couple meters. The shoe feels fine but a friend recommended me going to another store where they have a camera setup and software-supported running analysis. Now I am thinking wether it makes sense to go there and do a real running analysis or just go and run with the asics I already bought.

I’ve been using Altras for years but I haven’t been happy with newer models. I get lace bite sometimes, getting blisters recently and they’re just not durable. 

I went to a running store and tried several shoes. My favorite was probably the Hoka Bondi 9 in a D width, but they’re too narrow in the toe box.

Torin 8 isn’t the best. Women’s 9 in B width was too tight. Men’s 7.5 Wide was humongous. Women’s 8.5 wide was too narrow along the medial side. It’s frustrating.

1j5sm3a,AskRunningShoeGeeks,"Calf pain / strain and ""sinking"" heel shoes (not medical advice)","Hi all,

Probably a slightly odd question, but trying to work out the ""type"" of shoes I need to avoid. I seem to get on with a variety of different shoes, across a variety of drops and middle sole softness. A few examples I like.

On Cloud Monster Hyper  
New Balance SC Trainer V3  
Saucony Ride 17  
Vaporfly / Alfafly  
Endorphin Eite  
Original Hoka Rocket X  
On Cloud Stratus  
Plaid 1.5

As you can see, a mix of foams, rockers and heel drop.

However, in the past I bought some Hoka Mach 5 and it felt like I was sitting back in the heel when standing, with my toes pointing up. Basically felt like negative heel drop. They felt very odd to run in and calves ached. So I got rid.

My current long run shoe is the SC Trainer v3 which I find bouncy and propulsive. I fancied a non carbon plate daily, as I find the Ride 17 a bit hard at times and makes my feet sore. So I decided to get the NB Rebel V4. Seemed like a good match, on paper.

However, I put in on and immediately felt the same issue as the Mach 5, like I was almost tipping backwards. All weight in the heel and toes not feeling grounded.

Went for a short run and pulled my calf within in a mile. That was 3 weeks ago. Calf not right, but on the mend and I thought I'd try them again in case it was just bad luck that day and not related. Again, within half a mile my calf hurt so I stopped, walked home and put in the Rides. All good if harsh.

Disappointing, but looks like not for me. But as I look for shoes in the future, what is it about the Mach 5 and Rebel 4 that makes all the weight seem in the heel?

I was thinking too low drop, but the Rocket is fine at 5mm. Then I thought soft foam, but the Plaid 1.5 is like cake it is so spongy. The vaporfly and alfa fly are fine too.

Maybe rocker style, but the Elite is an agressive rocker and no issue for the marathon.

So I am not looking for shoee recommendations so much as what ""type"" are the Mach 5 and Rebel so I can avoid this toes in the air, negative drop 'feeling'.

Sorry if a slightly odd question, but want to avoid more expensive mistakes. If it helps, I am around 61K, 170cm and heel striker.

I wanted to get everyone's advice on using Hyperion 2's as a daily trainer. For context, I'm in my late 20's with a cross country background and have been running off an on ever since, but am coming back after about a 2 year hiatus. My ""most recent"" pair of shoes were Brooks PureConnect's from 2015-ish. I have a generally neutral stride with no previous injuries except for the knee pain that I'm currently experiencing (see below).

I recently tried on a wide variety of daily trainer shoes, then purchased and returned a pair of Asics Cumulus 27's because the fit was wonky, felt like I was running through sand, and they did a huge number on my knees and hips after very easy running. I don't think that I've ever experienced knee and hip pain in all of my years of running, and I'm actually on a pause from running because my right knee is still jacked up from my short time with them. After going back I ended up choosing a pair of Brooks Hyperion 2's because the fit was great and they were really fun to run in. I'm now doing research at home and it seems like they are much more geared towards shorter, high-tempo workouts and less as a daily trainer. My main focus with running in the short term is going to be more just ""going for a few mile runs"" and not focusing on speed and interval workouts.

My question is, is there any downside to using the Hyperion 2's as a daily trainer or should I swap them out for something like the Launch 10/11's, or something else in the brooks lineup? I'm hoping to stay with Brooks because they always fit my feet much better than other brands that I've tried. I never ended up trying the Launch's on in store and the Ghost's felt okay but not much else. This is my first time buying shoes in a VERY long time so I feel very out of date with all the trends in running shoes. Thank you for any and all insight!",2025-03-06 20:32:36+00:00,3,7

•Foot strike - I think I'm a heel striker, at least that's what the foot scan indicated. I'm neutral as far as pronation.  
•Shoe weight preference: light

I do all of my running on a treadmill and have been running in Brooks Ghost 15s, but I started getting numbness on the side of my left foot and a severe burning pain on the left side of my right foot. After a trip to the podiatrist, she recommended I get a shoe with a wider toe box.

So, I went to a local running store and had them take my foot measurements and watch my gait (although they only watched me walk, not run) and they recommended a standard width shoe since my feet weren't wide. Their recommendations were Altra Experience Flow, Topo Phantom, or Asics Gel Cumulus. I tried both the Altra and Topo and they both felt fantastic in the toe box, but I'm not sure if it's going from the higher drop in the Ghost to a much lower drop or if they're just firmer shoes, but both gave me terrible pain on the bottom of my feet while running. You know that feeling you get when you've bruised the bottom of your foot? It felt like that all over. The pain was bad enough that I was never able to even get through a 5k and it went away as soon as I took them off. I went back to my Ghosts and no longer have the foot pain on the bottom of my feet, but the numbness and pain on the side of my foot came back. I'm not able to test the shoes out at the store, so I have to bring them home and try them and then take them back if they don't work out.

I was already in decent shape, thanks to mountain biking, but I had 0 experience with running or sports where you need to run. 

I started with some Pegasus 38 that I had previously bought for long walks, so I suspect they were previously cooked. 

Now I'm able to run 10km at 5:20 and 3km at 4:40.

Most of my trainings are in this range, sometimes I also do intervals. 

I feel like I may benefit from a little bit of support against pronation, and after reading a lot of reviews, I was thinking mostly about these 2 shoes, as I'd like something a bit springy and not extremely tall or cushiony.

A Long run shoe (logically seems like a new pair of Glycerin GTS - never had trouble while using them). A speedwork shoe A race shoe

Guess just wondering if people can reccomend options for the Speedwork and Race shoe - I'm not wedded to any one brand for these, I don't think I need a supershoe or anything for the racing shoe given my level :)

I'd been previously fitted for the Glycerin GTS at a place that pops you on a treadmill/watches your gait type thing.

Also open to adding more shoes to create further rotation if it's recommended.

Thanks all!",2025-03-06 18:08:29+00:00,1,3
1j50jwe,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Help with marathon shoe,"I’m 43F, petite at 5’2 and around 120lbs. I’m preparing for my first marathon on May and running my first HM a week from Sunday. Ran my first 10k race back in Nov in just under 57 mins but have bettered that on a training run to 54 mins. I stretch goal is a sub 4 marathon, with Garmin’s current estimate of 4:07.

Started my training in the Puma Velocity Nitro 3 and ran my 10k race in these as it was in Storm Bert and I wanted the traction. I now mostly train in the Puma Magmax and sometimes New Balance SC Trainer v2.

I absolutely love the Magmax. It provides so much protection with the right level of firmness. If it were a bit more nimble and a little lighter, I’d be tempted to run it in. As for the SC Trainer v2, I find that too soft. It feels good at first but the longer I go the less I enjoy it. It’s been great for treadmill running this winter up to 4 miles. Have it one last go today on an 8 mile goal pace run and my knees didn’t like it.

I’m a neutral runner, average width foot, more of a mid-foot striker and have to keep my calves in mind as I’ve suffered multiple calf strains in my field hockey days. All the physio and strengthening has helped, but they are still a bit sensitive.

Comfort and protection is important, but still want some pop. I want a shoe that will keep the legs turning over, but not at the expense of comfort. Nike doesn’t work for me as the upper on the toe box comes down low and is irritating. I tried in the SB2 (and impossible to get) and didn’t really like the feel, although never ran in them. I also tried Brooks and they just don’t fit me well.

Any suggestions? I’ve been considering the Saucony EP4, but wonder if the upper over the toe box will be like the Nike. Never tried on a pair of Saucony. Wish I had running shops near me. Any suggestions will be much appreciate!",2025-03-06 17:15:35+00:00,3,6

I want to note that wearing asics is more for sentimental reasons but not limited to that.

With these shoes I ran about 10km/6mi a week, so not a lot. After the 15s were worn out I bought the newest version, which were the 19s. I have these since the beginning of 2024 now, where I have only used them a lot for the last 6 months. I am up to 3 runs a week and 25km/15,5mi. They have about 500km/300mi on them. However, since january this year I got an upcoming injury on the inside of my right ankle. It feels like I sprained it or something, which is not the case. The last 2 months I have been running on and off trying to overcome this injury and also when to fysio for some advice and exercises, but with no success.

Today I went for a first run on my new Saucony Tempus 2 and it was completely pain free...! My ankle was still a little sore from a 12km/7,5mi run I did on sunday, but it was so much less pain than with my Mizuno's. So apparently I do not have an injury at all, but my Mizuno's are not working for me anymore... Anyone has had a similar experience?

After reading several comments on my previous post ([Saucony Endorphin Speed 4: is this okay?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskRunningShoeGeeks/comments/1j301dc/comment/mfwrpy0/?context=3)), it seems that most people replying thought that these shoes had been used and that I was asking if what seems to be wear is normal.

I am posting again because (1) these shoes are brand new, (2) they were expensive (I paid 19900 Japanese yen; equivalent to 133 dollars and 127 euros), and (3) I know the new version are about to be released around June, even though I decided to pay full price for the outgoing version.

I’ve heard of some people continuing to use them for either tempo work or 5ks after retiring them from half marathon/marathons. Is this right?

1j30vim,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Do I really need a stability shoe?,"Had an in-store (natural) gait analysis recently, where I was recommended to go with either Brooks Glycerin GTS 22 or Adrenaline GTS 24 from the variety of shoes that I tried on the day.  Admittedly, the Glycerins looked and felt fantastic on foot when running up and down the street, whilst the assistant analysed my gait.

(Not verbatim) The assistant's reasoning behind those picks was that I have a mild-medium pronation, so required something that offered gentle correction with a wide enough mid-foot, and a little bit of added arch support (iirc my arch is slightly on the higher end of neutral).

I only recently got into running (last running phase was around lockdown)  currently clocking in 5Ks when I do head out (\~27-29min), and just starting to include some interval training.  I aim to hit further mileage in my runs at some point, so the shoe I buy would ideally be versatile enough to take on a range of activities / a capable and reliable daily runner.

I just bought a pair of Adizero SL2s, albeit a few sizes too small and considering an exchange for a larger pair, but concerned they may be too narrow in the mid foot and don't offer the right support/stability for me based on the shop assistants advice.

Does this matter so much given my circumstances?

If so, does anyone have some more budget friendly alternatives to the Glycerin GTS 22s they could recommend / know of some great budget daily runners that are wider in the mid foot and/or accommodate slight pronators better than the SL2s?

If it doesn't matter so much should i stick with the SL2s?

TIA  
\------------------------------------------------------  
EDIT: Thanks for all the great feedback! 

Given me a good amount to think (and plenty issues to avoid)!  

As much as I really wanted the SL2s to work, as I think even fancied them for just casual wear too (the smaller size is what I go for normally for my ""non-running"" shoes, and where I went wrong), I wasn't in the market for updating the wardrobe so off they go.

I booked myself for a couple foot scans and an indoor running analysis to see if they say anything different to the first one I had.  If more or less the same advice,  I think the suggestion of earlier glycerin/adrenaline iterations that were recommended is a good shout, and will try them on for fit along with some other more stable options mentioned that are similar in stats.

Thanks again for the guidance 🙌",2025-03-04 02:54:04+00:00,12,30

My current rotation consists of a **Saucony Tempus** (V1) as a daily trainer and for slightly faster/tempo runs and **Saucony Hurricane 24** for recovery / max cushion runs. My Half marathon pace is approximately 5:30/km (2hrs for a half marathon).

Unfortunately I'm quite a slow runner and so i have decided to purchase some speed/workout shoes for interval training to up my pace this year. I'm looking to improve my 5k time (current PB is 21mins) to hit sub20 and my 10km time (44 mins) to aim for sub40.

I was looking at endorphin speed 4, Endorphin pro 4, Asics super blast 2, NB Supercomp trainer (though I've heard these are slower compared to other ones I've listed). I do have a slight bias towards Saucony as I love their colorways and find their shoes fit/work well for me, but I am open to any suggestions (even those not listed).

The goal is essentially for a fast 5km-10km shoe that i can also use for faster workouts/interval training.

Unfortunately, Hoka decided to discontinue this shoe and I have been looking for some new line-ups. Currently, in rotation I have a casual carbon-plated trainer (a niche brand Xstep 260X 2.0). They are firm, responsive, and I have decided to wear them for upcoming Rotterdam Marathon; but looking for some fun all rounder for trainings and for future runs (e.g., half)

For stat, I am a tiny Asian woman 1.55m around 52kg. Proportionally, the sizing of my feets (36 wide/flat) makes it IMPOSSIBLE to find/try running shoes in the Netherlands…

Specs:
-L:21.9 R: 22.2 🤦🏻‍♀️
-Neutral Runner
-Heel Striker 
-Cadence: 175+ (training for higher)
-Base/Easy: 5:45 min/km
-Threshold: 4:29 min/km
If not training for Marathon, the run will be ranging between 5:10-5:40 min/km depending on distance.

Again, looking for some fun options for all-around trainers! Based on some testing, I have narrowed down to these 4. I know they are very different shoes, but would highly appreciate some advice :)

•Mach 6: I had the opportunity to test run 10 km with them but with size 37. Not as cushioning as Mach 5 and felt clumsy? But can be a backup option as Mach 5 works very well for me..

•Mach X2: Have not really run with it, but the fit was okay. I read a lot of reviews about the bloody heel, but personally was not very concerned (maybe too naive..) I might get another chance to test them on a 10k run (in 2 weeks) but will be testing in half size larger…

•Puma Deviate Nitro 3: Just tried them on in store today! (again one size larger 37) but immediately loving the hug and the bounce/energy from the soles! As Puma does not offer 36.5, I have the concern for my ‘wide mid-foot’, but 37 seems working well width-wise 🤔 The shopper told me it was nylon plate and it’s more durable. TG, I did more research  when coming back home. Hence, was curious about the durability of Puma Nitro with carbon plates.

•ASICS Superblast 2: Not a super big fan of ASICS (no hate), ran my first marathon with Nimbus 24 (5.5)…oh well just bought it because the shoppers said it was good for first-time runner. It was very snug in both length and width - blisters, black toe nails, pain in calfs…- however, I did try SB2 (again not the correct size) in stores and feel nice. Heard a lot of good reviews on the durability and versatility and would consider as an option!

Of course, feel free to share other options/brands ;) However, because of my “weird” sizing a lot of companies do not offer the half sizing options (e.g., Saucony) or the correct arch support - often very weird bump feeling near inner heels (e.g., NB Rebel v4) 🤦🏻‍♀️

My race trainers up until now have been Nike Tempo Next%.

Despite others' experiences with them, they have been the perfect race day shoes for me and have been my go-to race day shoes since my first marathon. The problem is they're on their way out and before I must retire them, I want a suitable replacement that I could potentially use for my next marathon in a months time. I also have a pair of Alphafly v1s which I've done about 160km in since purchase, which I love, but they cause heavy blisters within 10k under both my arches so I'm hesistant to dust them off. I am, however, open to trying any shoes even if they're nowhere near the same as the Next%s

I've run a few marathons over the years, PBs for FM, HM, 5k are 3:16, 1:31 and (00:)18:30 , I have mild overpronation but nothing has ever been of major concern on race days, I'm a heelstriker and my arches are on the lower side. I am currently doing S&C to help with this though. My easy pace is from about 5:05/km and slower.

My daily trainer history in reverse chronological order (with total mileage) as follows, I do (and have done) every run in these and don't have dedicated trainers for different workout types. I don't have a rotation and every pair of shoes before my current are retired.

* **Current:** Brooks Adrenaline 23 2E UK-9.5 (300km as of today)
   * No issues with these trainers
* Brooks Adrenaline 24 D UK-9.5 (60k)
   * Running <10k but from running 10k+ I had severe blisters on the front side at the bottom of both my arches. These were returned to Brooks under their Run Happy Guarantee after running about 60k total (I *really* wanted the trainers to work)
* Asics GT-2000 10 D UK-9.5 (940km)
   * Embarassingly, I never realised there were standard width and never really questioned any issues. This influenced the D purchase of the Brooks Ad24...
   * Running 10k+ resulted in blisters in both pinky toes, I was none the wiser and since blisters never actually stopped me from running, I didn't think much more of it
* Hoka Clifton 8 2E UK-9.5 (1300km)
* Asics GT-2000 9 (800km)
* Asics GT-2000 7 (800km)

I've been running for around a year and a half, mostly half marathons, but last year I ran a marathon and am looking to run more of them.

I've visited a doctor and he told me that the cause was flat soles on my left foot(my right foot doesn't have them), so I'm hoping that stability shoes might help with my problem.

What stability shoes should I get? Since I currently have Mizuno Wave Rider 25, Puma Velocity 2 and Velocity 3, I'm kinda looking at Puma ForeverRun and Mizuno Inspire 19, but I'm open to suggesions?

Sounds like consensus characteristics to aim for are high stack, low drop. AF1 being the most clear cut.

Endorphin Elite 2 with its super soft foam could be appealing to cushion with the impact from the downhill. But 8mm drop. And not everyone is digging the instability from the soft foam (going to check out for myself next week).

Elite 1 and MetaSpeed Edge Paris are also in the “best supershoe” conversation but firm foam suggests maybe not best for impact of downhill. AF3 also there but yea, 8mm drop and not quite as propulsive.

small size would make it odd for my shoes to be dead already. However, I do not have a shoe rotation and frequently run on shoes for consecutive days without letting them decompress.

1j1ojei,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Shoes similar to Gel-Cumulus 26,"Hello. I decided to create this post because my question is kind of specific.

So, little background. I am a 31 YO runner who started running more seriously 8 months ago (I started working with a coach). I am a rather slow runner (23:20 5k PB), (48:20 10k PB) and I am currently preparing for a half-marathon that's 8 weeks away. I usually clock around 30kms/week.

In march last year when I was still running on my own I bought myself Asics Gel-Cumulus 26 shoes. At that time I was dealing with shin splints due to the fact I had absolutely zero idea what I was doing training-wise so I decided I needed something cushioned but little bit responsive too. These shoes were great, I clocked 600 kms in them and decided I would move on and try maybe different brand, so I went for New Balance FreshFoam 1080 v13s (since they were on sale). They felt good out of the box, but right after the first workout I started having problems with runner's knee pain. Initially I did not connect this to new shoes so I thought it was because of increasing my weekly milage (slightly) and I have been dealing with this pain appearing after the workout for past month and a half. I also got Saucony Endorphin Speeds 4 for my speed workouts and they also give me knee pain.

Two days ago I had a long run planned and decided to take my old Gel-Cumulus 26 for a ride and I don't know if that is just coincidence but I felt much better during and after my run. Almost no knee pain. I can't help but think that maybe this shoes, how they are built, the technology used and the shape of them they are just better for my knees (and for my style of running maybe?). I don't know, I will take them for a few more runs and then NBs to compare my feeling, but I am already thinking about going towards Asics again.

My question is: what shoes would you say are most similar to Gel-Cumulus 26 in terms of feeling, cushioning and technology used but are maybe slightly more responsive? I am just looking for something little bit more exciting but something that will be good for my knees in a long run like Gel-Cumulus 26 were. I guess it means staying with Asics.

1j1loa6,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Return policies and finding the right shoes,"Tldr: How do you find the right shoe when most companies won't let you return after really trying a shoe. It has to be returned in as new condition. A 10k, needed to really test the shoe will leave it in non returnable condition.

Detail: Where I live in Europe has no large running stores with a big collection to test so it's a case of order online and return if they don't feel good. But this isn't the best system either as most won't accept a return unless it's not really been used. A 10k to test out the shoe will show enough usage to prevent a return. I'm a 7 and my first trainers, saucony Tempus in a 7 give a blister on my small toe after about 12k,so they are likely too small. My next trainers are triumph 21 in 7.5 which feels better, but I'd like to see if 8 is better or too big.
