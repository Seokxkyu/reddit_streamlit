1juz2gm,Coach,Powder Pink a limited edition,A couple of days ago someone posted that a SA told them that the powder pink collection will not be restocked and that it will be discontinued. Can anyone verify this to be true?,2025-04-09 06:15:33+00:00,3,0

However, I can’t decide which one to get. Here are some details to keep in mind while helping me choose: I’m a petite person, so I don’t like really big sizes.

1juyg4s,Coach,Rowan slouch?,"I recently ordered the large Rowan in the dark brown signature coach pattern and I can’t wait
for it to come in!! I’ve been debating between the black pebbled leather but ultimately ordered the brown because I love the look. For those who have the dark brown pattern… does the bag slouch like the soft leather ones or does it hold its structure? I really really love the slouchy look and I’ll exchange to the black if the brown doesn’t slouch eventually. ",2025-04-09 05:33:29+00:00,2,0

1juwkqn,Coach,Still in love with my navy Empire 40 🥰,"I’ve had my bag since Christmas and have travelled in a plane twice and a couple of small road trips and I really still love this bag! It fits so much and I enjoy carrying it by the handles and crossbody. The navy blue is such a deep rich color I think it is so pretty.  

When traveling I can comfortably pack my memory foam neck pillow (rolled tight in its own bag), switch, kindle, portable battery pack, AirPods, charging cord and a small lightweight jacket that folds into a small pouch. 

Overall after three months I’m still very happy about this bag! ",2025-04-09 03:38:07+00:00,24,3

1jusy1t,Coach,Help me pick a brown everyday driver shoulder bag!,"Looking for a brown bag for every day. I’m partial to the maple colour but am open to other browns that could work for every day. 

Juliet Shoulder Bag in Dark Stone - Partial to the maple colour but there isn’t one in this style anymore. Love that it has a zip and generous shoulder drop!

Soft Tabby in Maple - I already have a black tabby bag (regular tabby) but heard good things about this leather and style. I like that it’s  more secure than the Brooklyn bags. Worried it’s a bit too dressy for an every day bag.

Brooklyn 28 in Maple or Honey Brown - I really do love these but don’t love the lack of security (no zip or top flap) and i think it leans trendy rather than classic. I’m a bit worried Honey Brown is too “yellow” for my skin tone (light brown/beige). 

If you have any of these bags please share pictures!

##Post Flair

We've added some post flair recently and it's been pretty well received. I've found we could use a couple more and some others need clarification on our end. I won't take up post real estate with these changes -- here's the [post flair wiki page](https://reddit.com/r/Coach/wiki/flair) for your perusal.

If you have suggestions for other flair that could be useful, sound off in the comments!

##Buy/Sell/Trade Update - Proxy Buy/Sell

Y'all are super nice to offer, but we need to explicitly prohibit proxy buys. That is, don't use the sub to ask people to buy and ship a bag to you, and don't offer to do it for someone, either. Look into a parcel forwarding service that operates in the country where you want to buy and can ship to where you live.

This falls under rule #4, which has been updated accordingly.

---

##""Where Should I Sell?"" Posts

These posts are still an issue. So here's the scoop: these must be text posts from now on. Link posts (images) asking this question are going to get removed.

You don't need to post the bags you're getting rid of to ask this question. Even when you don't intend it to be, it ends up being sales bait -- people come and ask for you to sell to them or link the listing when you decide where to sell, on and on. Which, of course, is a violation of rule #4. So, no more link posts.

##Your Input

We recently passed 35k users and the sub continues to grow bit by bit, so the more active it gets here, the more important it is we try to run a tight ship without being too heavy-handed so that people still feel welcome and like they're having fun. That's a tough line to walk!

So, how about y'all? Any thoughts, comments, questions, concerns, asks? This is your community, too, so if anything is bothering you or on your mind, please let us know, either in the comments or via modmail. Don't be shy, we don't bite.

Is unboxing the fun part? 

Originally i thought i’d style them and put them in a large rope gift basket with a few other things. 

Although her mom is very into designer bags, i have not personally seen her subscribe to that culture. She does love pink tho.

Noob to buying new nice bags

1ju17hg,Coach,"Not another E40 🍯? Yes, another one 💛!","First post here and thrilled to share my Empire Carryall 40 in Honey!  I’m thinking of naming her Amber or Flame.  I got her from the Coach Play Store in Chicago and my experience was better than those I’ve had with LV, Chanel and Hermes (if you’re local I highly recommend going to see or call Michelle or anyone on her team there!).  She’s an early surprise doctoral graduation gift from my cousin/best friend. I initially thought I wanted the size 48 for an everyday handbag, but it’s too big. (A little birdie hinted that I may be getting the 48 in another color, and if that’s true then I’ll use it as a travel bag.).  I’m a tote girl through and through.  She’s not burnished at all (at least not that I can see) and that’s one of the things I like.  My taste and style is such that I prefer for it simply develop a natural patina over time.  

I’m not new to Coach.  Like so many others, I started with Coach many, many moons ago by getting my first belt in 7th or 8th grade (and 30+ years have passed since then).  Over the years, I acquired MANY all leather Coach bags. My interests faded a bit with the rise of canvas and logo bags.  Foolishly, I donated a HUGE part of my collection after I graduated from college and moved out of my family home (BTW, if you’re a collector of vintage and live in the Chicagoland area who shops at Goodwill in Evergreen Park…I hope you scored my treasures).  I regret not thinking that through and especially so because I recently saw a small cross body on the (re)Love site listed for $795 and I only paid a fraction of that for it in high school (luckily I still have it).  I may do a ‘what’s in my collection’ post once I’m done with the graduation festivities in May.  

Any-who, I’ve rambled enough.  Long story short: 1) I really love this bag in this size and such yummy color, and 2) Coach’s resurgence and it’s newer direction has not disappointed me and I am happy to fan the flames again.",2025-04-08 00:51:54+00:00,156,50

I don’t know what happened but over the last week or so I have been obsessing over vintage coach bags, trying to learn more about them, how how old they are, how many styles there are, which ones I want to purchase, etc. I spent so many hours last night just looking through secondhand listings and trying to discover more bags. I just don’t even know where to begin because there are so many varieties. I’m compulsive by nature so it’s hard not for me to spend so much of my time on this, but I find it so fun and interesting and I’m excited to purchase a new bag but also don’t want to do anything too suddenly as I know this should be more fun than stressful or costly. 

Anyone in a similar boat? Or if you just feel like chatting, let me know your favorite style! I personally love styles with a buckle that are on the more hobo side. The bigger the better. Just excited to see what else is out there that I don’t know about! ",2025-04-07 19:51:00+00:00,14,6

I’m a bit on the fence because of the leather and the color. I don’t live in the U.S., but my sister is visiting soon, so I’m considering asking her to bring it—especially since it’s currently on a nice discount.

She and I have been together since 2014 when I became her third owner (after she sat in my mom’s closet (2nd owner) for 10 years, and my aunt’s (initial buyer) closet before that) and has been through so much with me on the daily ever since. Needless to say: I adore this bag and love her to pieces. 

However her strap is starting to have issues from consistent use and it’s gotten to the point where it will slip from the buckles and I’m having to accept it just needs to be replaced. This has been my daily bag for over a decade now so I’m not surprised but I am concerned how to best replace it. I am very disconnected from the whole designer anything scene and I don’t know what to do- should I take her to a store? How much will it maybe cost to replace her strap? That stuff…

Also this is not for people who bought an item and just didn't love it or no longer need it. This is for the people who go and buy out all of the merchandise and then try to SEVERELY mark up the price to make a quick buck. It gives greedy vibes.

I don’t know if it’s too edgy for me and I feel like I maybe should’ve just gone with a Swing zip.

1jsxy7j,Coach,Am I being too nitpicky?,"Bought this Empire 28 from the Coach store yesterday. They had one on display, but the sales associate gave me a brand new one from the back. It was fully wrapped in plastic, foam, and stuffing, which was a hassle to unpack when I got home. Once I got everything off, I started noticing some imperfections in the stitching and edges. I’m wondering if these were hidden by all the packaging. 

The leather itself looks really nice and the bag seems well-made overall, but at $550, I’m not sure if these imperfections are something I should just accept. Would you return the bag over these flaws, or am I being too picky? 

One thing that worries me about returning it is that I’ve already discarded the tags and all the plastic wrapping.

1jsxelh,Coach,Let’s discuss: Why does everyone keep calling the Haversack bag a “Bleecker Street” bag?,"I’ve seen multiple listings of the super popular Haversack bag, claiming that the Haversack is a “Bleecker Street Haversack”. But from my understanding…the Haversack bag was NOT an original Bleecker Street bag. It’s an archive bag, which is still a limited edition bag - but not as limited as Bleecker Street bags.

“Bleecker Street” Coach bags were made SPECIFICALLY to be sold at the grand opening of the Coach Store on Bleecker Street in NYC in 2008. They will have a special hangtag stamp (see photo) and are extremely hard to find due to exclusivity. The Haversack bags do not have that….they are archive bags that were limited, but they were sold around the country at Flagship stores….",2025-04-06 15:59:39+00:00,9,8

Luckily this bag is still under the coach 1 year warranty but it just sucks that the thread unraveled when I’ve only worn this bag a handful of times and the bag is still in perfect condition (besides the thread). I was wearing a plain T-shirt and leggings with nothing that it could’ve snagged on, no jewelry either. Maybe it snagged on the purse zipper teeth? 

What’s the repair process at coach like? I’m planning on taking it in next weekend and I hope the process is easy. Do I need to bring the receipt proving date of purchase? On the website coach says repairs takes 4-6 weeks but does it typically take longer? ",2025-04-06 04:29:49+00:00,7,1

because i bought it around the winter season, there are currently no more of the pearl & gold color. so they can’t exchange my bag for a new one. i’m so sad because she is my first ever Coach bag, i just never thought to open it immediately for a closer inspection until i decided to use it around january.

Also to add stop making excuses. Reselling in general is all the same. Weather it’s “vintage” “thrifting” or these bags. 

The only reason y’all complain is because you cannot afford the reselling prices. Companies themselves pay Pennie’s in the dollars to make the bags yet resell for hundreds it’s life get over it and stop throw hissy fits on Reddit because you didn’t get the bag you wanted. 

Also to add the same people on here that complain about resellers have online stores and resell themselves. Stop being hypocrites just because it  items you want.

If it's all of my essentials and I've gotten so many compliments on it. I'm on the search for it in white now but it's so hard to find lol,2025-04-05 15:46:35+00:00,229,13

As a returning customer after a long hiatus of buying no bags, I think this bag has re-awakened my admiration of bags lol. I am a repeat offender with buying the same thing in different colors. I can see myself having a collection of empire 28s.

Sorry if the pics are not right. I am fairly new to Reddit. I normally just lurk.

My question is, is this stitching and finishing normal for an empire? I have a few other bags in different price points (Tod’s, Dooney, Coach Brooklyn, etc.) and feel like their stitching and edging is pretty perfect. I never notice it. This just makes me disappointed though and I feel like for such an expensive bag (for me) that it should be better? Are my expectations unfair? Maybe it’s just that it’s a lighter colored bag so I notice it? I was so excited about it and now I am just kinda…meh and sad.",2025-04-04 22:32:23+00:00,3,11

1jrimsj,Coach,Glovetanned vs Original Glovetanned vs. Genu*ne Glovetanned,"Hi hi! So first off, I am by no means claiming to be an expert, and for liability purposes this is very much the personal opinion of somebody that went down a (rather deep) rabbit hole when researching this topic.  
  
I went down said rabbit hole because I noticed a huge difference in the leather of my Coach bags  (vintage bags vs. second-hand rogue vs. brand new rogue). This was despite them all being labelled as 'Glovetanned Leather' and while I was able to find bits of information in other threads & websites, there was no one place where all this information was compiled.   
  
That being said, if there are any mistakes in my conclusions, please feel free to correct me (or to add on any information you may know!). 

  
**Glovetanned Leather**

* Referring to the method in which leather was prepared to make Baseball Gloves (hence 'Glove'tanned)
   * Idea was Baseball Gloves were super sturdy and durable, could take a lot of wear, and yet were super soft and had a gorgeous sheen/patina when worn in
   * Technically a marketing term coined by Coach - What they marketed as Glovetanned Leather is pretty much Chrome Tanning, as that is what was used to process leather for Baseball Gloves
* Marketed as 'Top Grain Leather' at the time, which is equivalent to today's 'Full Grain Leather'
   * Reason why true vintage Coach bags (Circa 1941 - Late 1990's) have such thick leather
   * Previously called 'Top Grain Leather' because it included the outermost layer of natural leather (The technology didn't exist yet to make splits, which is why modern day 'Top Grain Leather' is different from vintage 'Top Grain Leather')
* Coloured with Aniline Dye, a semi-transparent dye that showcases all the natural markings on leather
   * Semi-transparent dye means all the 'range marks' (markings from all the mishaps cows naturally get into, i.e. cuts, scrapes, stretch marks, etc) are fully visible
   * The lack of 'range marks' on most vintage bags while using an Aniline Dye was suppose to be proof that Coach only used the best grade leather available
* This type of Glovetanned Leather was predominantly used between 1941 to the late 1990's
   * Characterized by having the animal's natural skin as the topmost layer, with an unlined interior showcasing the natural suede of the leather (Exceptions for the 'Cashin Bags' designed by Bonnie Cashin, featuring the colorful striped linings)

  
**Original Glovetanned Leather**

* Started moving away from the traditional 'Glovetanned Leather' described above, and more into splits
   * Splits: When leather is literally split into different layers - theoretically to make it thinner and lighter, but also so more products can be made from the same skin
* Also unsure of what dye Coach started moving towards, but it seems to have been a more opaque dye (think the y2k colours of bright pink / teal / purples / etc)
   * My guess is that they were following the y2k trends, but also the more opaque dyes would have allowed them to hide the blemishes on the leather
   * This would have also translated into them being able to possibly use lower grades of leather for their products (leather with more 'range marks' that they could resurface and then dye, or just purely hide with dye
* 'Original' was added to the front of 'Glovetanned Leather', presumably to capitalize on the fact that it was still 'Full Grain' or 'Top Grain' leather (utilized by other companies of that era to differentiate between 'Genu\*ne Leather' and 'PU Leather'
*  Unsure when it started showing up, but it was showing up on bags (Specifically Coach Rogue Bags) as late as 2021
   * From what I could. tell (and I could be wrong!) it seems to be tied to when Coach started moving their manufacturing overseas to China to save on costs.
   * Characterized by smoother leather (or a super uniform 'pebbling' that is added by machine after smoothing away the blemishes', thinner feeling leather when compared to the 'Glovetanned Leather' above, and bags that have linings to compensate for the thinner leather / hide the lack of a suede interior

**Genu\*ne Glovetanned Leather** 

* 'Genu\*ne in front of 'Glovetanned Leather'
   * THIS PART IS GUESSWORK ON MY PART BUT 'Genu\*ne Leather' often refers to lower cuts of leather in the industry - It still contains leather, but there is no guarantee on the quality, type, or even how the leather is incorporated
   * Usually not as durable as 'Full Grain Leather' or 'Top Grain Leather'
   * 'Genu\*ne Leather' does not develop a patina over time
      * I have not found any sources speaking definitely on whether or not it will soften over time
* Smooth vs Pebbled 'Genu\*ne Glovetanned Leather'
   * Smooth: Refinished by sanding down the surface so that it's flat and even - removes the blemishes that might otherwise be on the leather itself
   * Pebbled: Same process as above, but then stamped by a machine to make the 'Pebbled' texture - usually can tell because the texture is quite homogenous in size, shape, and repeats itself
* Finish seems to be less of a dye, and more of a paint
   * Helps make the bag more waterproof, but again it means lower grades of leather can be used.
* Currently in use by Coach",2025-04-04 18:13:51+00:00,14,2
1jrhxrl,Coach,Purse peace is near ✨,"This is my non-vintage Coach collection. It’s definitely not big but each purchase was intentional and I will wear them to death. Also happy to say that the only things I paid full-price for were the Lana, motif chain charm, and essential card case 🤭

Might’ve paid higher for the cherry sunglasses case, but I don’t know much much it was on the Outlet and it’s the only cherry print anything that I cared for. I just had to have this one! 🍒💕

If I were to add anything it would be the Alter/Ego shoulder bag in chalk and maybeee the Chain Tabby 30 in sage. Big maybe cause I have a rule of “no two of the same color or style”.

1jrdlki,Coach,Please help me choose between the Maple or the Black Empire Carryall 34. Which would you choose?,"I was debating really hard about getting this bag. I know that this is Coach’s version of the East-West bag which is a really trendy style right now that has made a huge comeback, so this bag already has a strike against it because it’s probably more trendy than timeless... But despite knowing that, I still just really love the silhouette and the shape of the bag that I honestly don’t care if it goes out of style in a couple years, I know that I’ll love it’s silhouette forever. Plus fashion is cyclical, so once the East West trend goes out of fashion again it can just come back into trend later again. So I don’t care if this bag is “trendy” I just honestly love the shape and the silhouette so much and I think it looks so classy! That’s why I decided I really want to buy this bag, and that I will buy this bag, when I get paid next week.

That being said I’m having so much difficulty choosing between the black and the maple right now. Please help me choose! I love that both have brass hardware but I don’t know if I should go with the Maple or the Black. I only have 2 bags right now and it’s the suede/leather Coach Soho Flap in True Pink, and a nylon navy-blue Longchamp Le Pliage 

Me personally I loveee how the Maple color looks, but I’ve read that some people on this sub mainly see Maple as Fall and Winter colors meanwhile Black is versatile and can be worn with anything and can be worn all year. But in terms of which color looks more beautiful to me I definitely think that the Maple 34 looks more beautiful than the Black 34, but that the Black 34 is much more versatile so please help me choose! My bag collection is only at 2 bags right now so I need to be very intentional and mindful about how I’m slowly expanding and growing my collection. Also to note is I work 4 to 5 days out of the week as a server (sometimes 6 days if someone calls off and I have to cover) at a fine dining establishment which has an All Black dress code for our work uniform, so most days of the week I’m wearing all black because I’m at work more days than not, so I know the Black 34 will make my work uniform look sleek and cohesive in an all black ensemble 

But the Maple is just so pretty. Like the rich chocolate brown is so appealing and elegant.  And if just going by beauty alone I find the Maple much more beautiful than the Black, But Black by nature is a more versatile color to pair with outfits. So I really don’t know! Please help me choose, what would you choose? I’m so indecisive.",2025-04-04 14:43:58+00:00,13,17

Whoever said this baby was heavy was NOT lying. But she’s so pretty. Somewhere in between my car and my job I have lost my Coach hang tag which I had engraved 😭 While taking pictures to post, I just noticed. I’m bummed about that but hopefully it turns up in my car or somewhere at home. I can’t believe it came off so easily. 

Anyways, here’s some pictures of this beauty! 💗",2025-04-04 13:22:01+00:00,43,5
1jrbm6o,Coach,Wrong color,"I'm kinda saad
I ordered the red Brooklyn 28 on Ebay, thinking I just got a really good deal with it being around 200€ (it was stated that it's from the Outlet soo I figured it made sense)
The description said ""Red Dark Ruby"" but when I opened it today, it was the Scarlet Red version :(
And as much as i want to love her, it's just not the right red shade for me (I don't know it I'm being unreasonable here)

Can I maybe bring the bag to a leather expert and ask if they could darken the color?
Or should I just send it bag and actually lose the hope of ever owning a Dark Ruby Brooklyn?
(It's sold out everywhere and the re-seller prices are through the roof)",2025-04-04 13:15:58+00:00,4,29
1jrb0xn,Coach,My Lana 23 😍,"Ordered her for my birthday last month but never posted. Love her so much! This color is everything! I get compliments all the time with people sometimes saying, ""That's Coach??"" The boutique/retail bags are really another level. I usually buy from the outlet. I brought her in-store and got my tag personalized too. I bought the Coach cherries and dinky chain with her then returned the cherries and bought a dupe from Amazon... but instead of keeping that money like a good girl, I turned around and bought the Essential Chain card case in stone instead! Wish they had that in maple. Initial charm is also from Amazon. I haven't used her without the crossbody strap yet. I live in NYC so I find hands-free a necessity when out and about!

1jr5k66,Coach,"Just received my “purse peace” bag, so time to show my complete Coach collection!","I just received the 1941 Saddle Rogue that I have wanted for a while off Poshmark and now am at purse peace - shopping my own closet only from now on. Also am Canadian and Coach is American and well, if you know you know. Sorry, Coach. Resale from my fellow Canadians is okay in my view but it’s also time to tighten up the finances because…*waves hands around*.

All my bags were purchased direct from Coach excepting the Saddle Rogue and the Amazon Green Soft Tabby that were both Poshmark buys. As you can see, if I really like a bag I tend to buy multiples.

As to my more modern day Coach story: Stuart Vevers brought me back to Coach in 2016/2017. I just loved the direction he took Coach in. *Especially* the Rogues. I bought a few bags then, and have kept all but two which have since gone to new homes. I don’t plan to ever part with what remains, they truly all being my joy. I then took a years-long bag ban break until coming back last year and as you can see I went a bit ham. The new ones also bring me joy and don’t foresee reducing them from my collection ever. Being “forced” to stop now is not a bad thing!

I also found that I like their clothing and have a few coats/ponchos (almost all retail).  🔥

As shown in photos:

1. Rogue in 1941 Saddle (later 2nd gen)

2. Rogue 31 in Prussian Blue Whipstitch, Olive, and Butterscotch (earlier 2nd gen)

3. Rogue Satchel in Black, 1941 Whipstitch Saddlebag in Mineral, Rogue 25 in Chalk/Oxblood

4. Soft Tabby in Ivory/Brass, Amazon Green, and Black/Brass, also featuring my chain collection

5. Broome Carryall in Black and Dark Stone, Sammy 21 in Black

6. Cassie 19 in Black Denim, Denim, and Black with Rivets

7. Empire 40 in Maple and Honey Brown

8. SLGs: Key Case, Essential Card Case in Honey Brown, Half Flap Wallet on Chain with Rivets, Bandit in Ivory/Brass, and Notebook in Daisy

1jr1opx,Coach,Need a Bigger Bag,"Hi! Would anyone have a recommendation for a bag that is slightly bigger than the Brooklyn 28?

Presently it holds a couple of pouches with my wallet, spf, compact mirror, lip balm, hand wipes, hand sanitizer, mask, and motion sickness candies.

I can add a tiny notebook or my dog's traveling water cup, but at that point it's a bit stuffed and difficult to rummage in quickly, so I find myself avoiding that.

Ideally I'd like to also be able to add the notebook, cup, small waterbottle, and a phone charger, a couple of makeup items... And for it to all fit comfortably, without bulging or being wedged in on top of one another.

It looks like the Brooklyn 39 is TOO big, and the Swing Zip is even smaller. I was also looking at the Gramercy (perhaps too big? I can't tell if everything would just fall out, it looks like the East-West design might make it easy for pickpockets?), and the Manhattan tote (but I think I prefer a slouchier look in a bigger bag?).

If any of you have these bags and have any input, I'd be very grateful! Thank you!",2025-04-04 02:52:02+00:00,7,12

1jqn7zv,Coach,So sad 😢,"This SoHo 25 bag caught my eye online, but my in-person experience was quite disappointing.

Initially, I was drawn to the Signature collection’s SoHo Flap, but unfortunately couldn’t find one.

When I received the bag, it was well-packaged, but I faced an issue with the flap. After removing the factory packaging, I couldn’t get it to stay closed. I tried various methods to secure it, but the magnet wasn’t strong enough, and the buckle appeared to be stitched unevenly, creating a gap at the top on one side and sitting flush against the flap on the other.

Additionally, I found that I couldn’t carry as much as I had expected. Overall, I’m disappointed with the quality and functionality of the bag.

I’m curious if anyone else who ordered this bag from the recent retail drop encountered similar issues. If so, do you have any recommendations for alternative bags that might be a better fit for my needs? I’ve considered the Hamptons Hobo, but I’m concerned about the potential annoyance of the clasp 😭",2025-04-03 16:37:29+00:00,21,18

Macy’s is offering $20 “star points” per $100 spent.

My plan is to purchase the Brooklyn 39 at Macy’s (~$500 and get $100 “star points”), purchase the card case ($100) at Coach and get some monogrammed hangtags at Coach. That suggests I’d basically be getting the card case for “free” and could still get hangtags.

I purchased a bag from a SA a few months ago with whom I instantly clicked, and I went in yesterday to look at a few different bags. I’m going back in tomorrow to make a couple of purchases.

I want to remain loyal to this SA because she is wonderful - listens, isn’t pushy, and is overall great to work with. My question is, do Coach SAs receive commission on purchases made through them? If that’s the case, I would be happy to purchase through her in the store vs. shopping online. We texted a bit today about the availability of the bag I want, so I promised I would stop in tomorrow. Other than the basics of being kind, clear communication, and not being annoying with the texts, are there any other keys to building a really good relationship with an SA?

i usually tend to buy black bags but at the same time i do think the signature canvas is pretty. i’m just afraid it’ll clash with my winter jackets and/or other colours of clothes im wearing (esp during the day).

1jpux3b,Coach,glowing review: jamie camera bag 🐈,"two weeks ago i bought my first full sized jamie camera bag, and all i have to say is I’M MAD AT Y’ALL why is no one talking about how amazing this bag is?? 

i am usually a shoulder bag girl, i used to despise crossbodies, specifically ones in this kind of shape, but i’ve grown fond of them over the years and was looking for one that could be my travel/everyday work horse. i stumbled upon one in one of my dream prints and that’s how we got here. 

since the moment i got this bag, i have exhausted it. it has gone everywhere with me, from buying a car to birthday parties to work and everything inbetween. everytime i was sure something wasn’t gonna fit in it, it did. a kindle? takes up practically no space in the bag. two packs of press ons in an already full bag? could’ve bought more. it is a small bag but she is MIGHTY. the back pocket is amazing for easy and safe access to my phone, and the leather/chain strap combination is so cute and feels very safe for travel. it’s also an incredibly easy bag to wear because the shape is very neutral and suits every outfit. i am truly in love with this bag and need everyone to know about it because i barely see any talk about the jamie bags (compared to how much we hear about shoulder bags from coach etc)! special thank you to the lovely user on here who told me a bit more about the size of the bag before i got it, you truly didn’t exaggerate! 🐈🫶🏻 ",2025-04-02 17:48:14+00:00,34,2

This is obviously a nice basic classic style but I was wondering if it had a name or current style number I could look up?

Also - not looking for authentication I know that's not allowed - but if you believe I found a fun dupe instead feel free to say I'd be interested in understanding better what to look out for!

My only concern with both of these bags are if my phone would fit. I’ve been in store before trying to see if my phone would fit into the swinger and each time it seems like a tight squeeze so I never continue to try. I have an IPhone 13 Pro Max. So if anyone has a iPhone pro does your phone fit in the swinger 20? 
I love the tiny bags for this blue and prefer the look of the swinger to the swinger zip but I absolutely love this color so If the swing zip is a better option I’d still grab it. 
I do have a Nolita 19 and my phone does fit in it with room for my essentials so I don’t mind a small bag just wondering if my phone would fit? 

If you have either of the bags please let me know if you like them and what fits in the style of bag for you?

1jow8k7,Coach,Feedback on the Empire 48 & Wesley Camo Tote pls?,"Stopped by the NYC Hudson Yards store over the weekend to pick some things up for my daughter & saw these 2 beauties for me? Can anyone give me their feedback? I was thinking the empire 48 for an overnighter even though I’m an overpacker (but trying to get better). I also have a dying Prada camo tote that I love but the handles are a mess. I liked the Wesley for a “schlepping crap tote”.

Also, does anyone know how soon they’ll be switching to new hang tags? I love their hot stamps but that cheap toilet ball chain is not so nice. I’ve been replacing my daughters w colored matching anodized aluminum & my eyes don’t hurt as much… 

Someone please help convince me to buy one or both of these beauties? TIA",2025-04-01 13:58:12+00:00,9,8

1jnobdn,Coach,Round 2: Soho 25 in Chalk,"I recently posted about my unsatisfactory experience with the Soho 25 in Chalk. When I had received it, USPS had crammed it in my mailbox! But when I saw the package, the flap did not meet the fastening near the base of the bag. Uh-oh. As noted, it kept popping up. But also, I didn't detach the chain and the crossbody strap. Not only was the magnet faulty, but it caused the bag to be unbalanced and affected its closure. I'd already reached out to Amazon for a replacement, and they sent it right away. This time I removed the strap and the chain and placed my articles inside. Much better: The bag could properly close and when I turned it upside down it didn't pop open. I'm not saying that it can't happen, because it could. Be careful when you use the bag. I recommend you keep your card case zipped in the inner pocket.

Also a little weird thing: the trim on the inside is not chalk, but tan. You'd think they could have matched the trim to go with the outside of the bag, but there you go. ",2025-03-30 22:21:29+00:00,5,9

It was so useful for organizing my loose items like lipgloss, mini lotion, mini perfume etc. They only give 2 inner card slots now, which I NEVER use. I hate when Coach makes unnecessary changes. I don’t think I will buy anymore Nolita’s due to this change, and the increasing price. If they wanted to change something, they could’ve made the straps a bit longer?

The flower chains are stunning in person and I hope they make more designs/colors.

pick out different chains and charms and try them on multiple bags. I even had my tag monogrammed!

I have it in black and it doesn't have that problem. It also came with a lot less wrapping/stuffing than my black one which makes me think someone else also returned it. 

I ordered online. If I mail the return in about how long do they usually take to credit you back? Would they think that any of the weird looking leather is my fault?

My closest store is an hour and a half away. I kind of want to go anyway to look at the new bags in person - how is it returning online order in store? It didn't come with an order sheet or anything, do they just look up my order with my phone number?

1jmig7u,Coach,"Times Square Tabby 17 in Chalk review (satisfied, so far)","I fell for this bag design because I love squarish shapes but there was no way I was going to Chanel to spend almost 10 grand in my local currency.

Going in person to Coach, the 17 had the compact look while seeming to fit essentials in; the 17 size also allows for doubling as a casual-dressy evening bag especially with the chain option strap.

I liked the softness of the napa leather, there was some slight natural wrinkling and the depressed quilting isn't for everyone, but I liked that.

What I was impressed with was that the magnetic button clasp (correct me on this if needed) was beautifully designed and sturdy. It had a long stem for ease of use whereas luxury-luxury brands sometimes use tiny press stud closures with no magnet, yet command far higher prices.

The brass C looks very nice in person.

I will post again after 3 months - will probably only wear with light clothing to avoid color transfer, and also I will be careful not to scratch or tear the delicate soft leather.",2025-03-29 09:17:59+00:00,9,0

1jm9thz,Coach,Strike 2: Return of Swing Zip 20,"It's my fault. I was so excited that I ordered the Swing Zip and that beautiful pale blue. At the time. Macy's had not specified that this was the 20, or I would have given it a pass. (They did it after the fact.)  It came quickly. I removed it from the package with most of the packing and styrofoam still on the straps. I'm not very tall at 5'3 and I'm short-waisted,. However, my body type is not suited for this silhouette. I'm bigger in the shoulders and bust. So while it does fit, it doesn't suit me.  This is why I do not purchase baguette bags because they emphasize the wrong things. I didn't want to unwrap it all the way and do a mod shot. Wanted to keep as nice as possible
There's a reason we do not see the models with this little bag on their shoulder: It would look ridiculous, because I'm pretty sure they're tall.   So, it's going back. Unless you're going to drape it from your arm like a satchel, it's best suited for very slim people under 5 feet tall. The strap drop is under 10 inches.  The regular Swing Zip It's popular because it works for a lot of people due to the strap drop and its scale. 

Too bad, it's a gorgeous color. ",2025-03-29 00:17:01+00:00,18,7

Some recent posts inspired me to decorate my current “everyday” Lula bucket bag a lil more eclectically and I’m excited to use my other vintage bag style 9127 (ive found conflicting reports on her name) with more modern accessories for spring. She’s reminiscent of the tabby but without the giant C logo which I love and is the most buttery soft of all my bags 😍🤤

I’m searching for the Coach Bleecker Street Haversack in any colour! Based in the UK and they really are like gold dust here due to them being an archive piece and also us not having PoshMark here etc.

So, the reason for me searching for one is actually quite personal. My Nan used to have one and I always remember seeing it when I was a kid and thinking how stunning it was. It started off an obsession with Coach bags that’s for sure haha! 

Anyway, unfortunately after her passing it got lost in the house clearing. The version she had was the brown colour but I’m not super particular on colour because it’s the uniqueness of the bag itself that reminds me of her. I remember specifically going into the little coin purses on the ends of the bag to get change out of them when she said I could buy a treat from the shop. 

I’ve just this second missed a listing on eBay for the green version and I’m kicking myself, if you find any links at all, especially any with a buy it now price on please send them my way, I’d very much appreciate it! It would be great if these were on eBay on Vestaire as we don’t have access to any sites such as PoshMark or Mercari sadly.

1jlkadc,Coach,Coach Soho 25 Weak Magnet?,"I Just received the Soho 25 crossbody and chalk from Amazon. It came factory wrapped but the bag was not fully closed. After removing the stuffing and the wrapping, I placed a few items: phone, keys, wallet.  I had difficulty closing the bag because the magnet was weak. The flap didn't want to match up to the magnet at the base of the bag. It kept popping open. Think it. It was unbalanced. I moved the chain over to the other side of the bag, but It's still would pop open. To test it, I turned it upside down, and it popped open. I had removed it from the packaging twice and just decided I was returning it to Amazon. I had a requested a replacement. Unfortunately they had put it in a padded envelope and stuffed it in my mailbox.  I don't know if it had damaged the bag. It didn't look like it.  Not sure if this is a fluke, or a fly in the design.

So, if you receive yours, be sure to check your magnet.

1jlj12i,Coach,Bought My First Coach Tonight,"I have never been huge into Coach. I always thought their style was old fashioned and so monotoned. My mom would always drag me into the store while she bought stock in the company (haha).

I’ve been on the search for a larger bag that I could wear as a crossbody and shoulder bag. I was over carrying the tiny purses where I could barely fit my phone, keys, and AirPods.

I intended on buying Kate Spade. I have had the same Kate purse I’ve worn every day since 2021, so I thought it was time for a new one. I was getting a Kate, but I was racially profiled when I went in the store. I wasn’t greeted and when I asked about a price of a purse, I was given very blunt responses. My mom said Coach was next door, so we left Kate and went to Coach Factory.

I was immediately greeted by the staff and they asked me what I had in mind. They were able to help me find the perfect bag and matching wallet. The staff and customers were of all colors and sizes. I felt like I was appreciated there as a consumer. 

Safe to say, I am a Coach convert now. I wanted the cherry charm because I love everything pink, but it was not at the price point I wanted. 

I am going to look online for charms before my new bag makes her debut ",2025-03-28 01:00:00+00:00,55,14

1jlipd0,Coach,How to tell if a vintage leather bag is a good deal or too pricey?,"I just started looking into buying vintage coach bags. I love the old styles and I especially love thrifting. So I EXTRA love the idea that I thrift long-lasting pieces (with care) that will last me a long time. 

So I’m looking at a rare color of vintage coach in the style 9981, but the asking price is $375. From looking, it seems that the average price is 100-150$ with more newer/never been used bags being more towards 150-200$. Are bags in more rare colors warrant that kind of price hike? What should I be on the lookout for when buying vintage coach?

1jlb0cf,Coach,I am coach outlet girly through and through but should I splurge on either of these ? 💕,"Hi! 
I am a coach outlet girl through and through as that’s what is usually in my budget. But I’ve been loving the look of these two Coachtopia bags. And I am so undecided whether I should splurge on either of these models or get a retail bag. For context I am 30 years old work corporate but mostly from home and I usually go for bags that have a zipper as I tend to just throw them in my car. I have like 3 Teri’s because I love the shape but I am trying to get something a bit different. I really wanted the Brooklyn but I honestly got a doop and did not love the fact that I didn’t have a zipper and realized it was not worth the splurge for me. I usually try to stay under 200 for my bags and I’ve bought second hand as well. So this a bigger splurge for me but I did get a raise so I kinda want either.  I really like the look of the checkered bag as I think it’s like a more of a statement bag for me. But I also love the look and color of the satchel…  as it is more classic and summery and reminds me of the miu miu bag. I have another bag that’s brown which is the large city bucket bag but it’s a different type of brown. I’m so indecisive 🤷🏽‍♀️ I love both but cannot afford both… well I mean technically I can but I shouldn’t. AHHH",2025-03-27 18:31:45+00:00,15,4

1jla954,Coach,Calling all Originals fans and mini collectors,"The Swing Zip 20, Soho 25, Swinger 20 and Dinky 14 - All scaled down versions of pieces from the archival originals collection, have dropped! 

The scoop I have is that the Swing zip 20 is being released in limited quantities and only to “Gen Z” doors. After these quantities are gone we may expect a restock later in the summer. 

Maple jacquard, robin’s egg blue, butter yellow, glossy patent are all trending heavy for the spring. Don’t miss the crystal chains, they’re a gorgeous accessory on a lot of these new bags. 

Thinking summer, the woven/straw Brooklyns are fabulous and priced at $195 and $295 respectively. 

Lots of fun newness this season! Honey Brown Empires in both the 28 and 48 sizes are now available. 

As always pm me if I can help connect you with any product you’re looking for. Happy Spring Shopping!

1jl9sif,Coach,Kira Crossbody from Woot!,"I snagged the Kira Crossbody in Anthracite from Woot for $75 and I am so pleasantly surprised!

It arrived in like two days with factory packaging inside of an Amazon package. Perfect, brand new, not a single concern about it. 

I had been eyeing the Kira for a while and waiting for a good deal. I wasn’t sure about the Anthracite because I was worried about how it would wear over time and how well it would go with my casual style. The leather is amazing quality and does not feel it would wear out or peel any faster than another soft leather. The color is definitely more of a statement piece but I think the size of the bag makes it work with pretty much anything!

I would love to find a short shoulder strap that matches… any recommendations??",2025-03-27 17:41:41+00:00,24,2

1jl5sse,Coach,Help! I need info on this bag.,"Hi all! I need some help. I do not have the bag on hand now, but I am trying to identify it. The serial number is either J0693-10517 or J0693-10526. I believe the color is either Legacy Red or Legacy Salmon, but it came in a bunch of different colors. As I'm sure many of you can deduce, it was issued in September 2006 from their #93 plant in China.

What I don't know is whether it had a name (i.e. Brooklyn, Mandy, etc.) or what collection it was part of. I'm thinking it might have been the 65th Anniversary Legacy collection, but it's missing the chunky hardware and does NOT have a striped interior (interior lining is black). I tried looking through archived catalogues, videos, and even tried calling Coach unsuccessfully.

I'm no purse guru, and I'm definitely not well-versed in Coach. Can anyone offer any insight on this one? Thanks so much in advance.",2025-03-27 14:54:47+00:00,3,6

My team put the jacket into the machine, witht he cuff buttoned. After we took it out a few buttons were torn off including the cuff. 

I sent it to my local Coach service centre, but they said they couldnt repair jackets/garments they only repair bags. They suggested me to go to the local tailors but 1) they dont have spare buttons 2) the buttons are pressed in and not sewn into. We tried sending it to few tailors and they said they couldnt do it.

Just FYI, the customer knows about this and asked us to fix it or she wanted compensation. Thing is this jacket cost around USD 300 here.

1jl0a2f,Coach,Want to apply to work at Coach but have no retail experience.,"Hi! 

A Coach store is going to open in the summer at a mall that I work a food service job at. It’s sort of been a recent dream of mine to work at a Coach store, but I’m worried I’m a long-shot since I have no formal retail experience. 

For context, I am 23 and I have a bachelors degree in film production. I have 7 years of experience in food service and also teaching/tutoring. (Sort of done a lot of random jobs!) That said, I am very passionate about Coach. I can recognize most modern and vintage Coach bags in the wild, can tell what era and sometimes even the exact color/model. And I think I’m starting to learn a lot about the brand history and leather/bag crafting process as it’s all very interesting to me. 

So do you think I might be able to swing it? Let me know! Any advice is appreciated!!

1jkt7ha,Coach,First time buying in store — Disappointing experience,"Went to a Coach store in NYC (don’t want to specify which one because of the 2 differing experiences I had) to try the Brooklyn 28 in Honey Brown 2 weeks ago and had a LOVELY experience. I’m in my early 20s and I often find when I go into stores I’m not taken seriously, or notice people older than me are treated better. I also look younger than I am, so I’m sure that contributes. This was not my experience at Coach that day, as the sales associate (I wish I had gotten his name!) was SO nice to me, and it was my first time really being impressed by a sales associate. He was able to find the bag despite it not being on the floor, we talked about other bags in the store for awhile and in general I was just so impressed. He honestly really *sold* me on the bag, but it being a big purchase I went home to sleep on it. 

I was so happy with this first experience I made it a point to go back to that exact store a week later. Unfortunately the sales associate I had a good experience with was not there when I went back, and I had a less than stellar experience with the one I worked with. She was distracted the entire time. They also didn’t have the bag in the size I wanted, but even getting the bag in the color I wanted took them like 30 minutes. The store was not busy at all. We were one of maybe 5 customers in the store, with some people coming in and out. When I told the sales associate I wanted to purchase the bag, she started to get the order started on an iPad, but then kept getting distracted and going over to greet people entering the store? It felt like she kept forgetting about me and was honestly really frustrating. I ended up being in the store for like an hour and still walked o it empty handed because they didn’t have my bag in stock. This was partially a learning experience for me, because I’ll always ask in advance if they have what I want in stock, but if anyone has any advice about knowing when a SA you like is there let me know. I would like to find the SA I liked again to thank him.

Anyway, this is where the nightmare began. It’s been almost 5 days now and I have no tracking information. I reached out to Coach Customer Care last night and they told me they have info for in-store purchases which makes no sense to me. I called the store today and they told me to reach out to Customer Care. I told them I already did that and they took down my phone number and transaction number and said they would get back to me. I got a call later and they said there was a “little flub on our end” (whatever that means) and the bag will be overnight shipped to me. I asked where the tracking number was, and they said I would receive it when it was shipped. I’m super skeptical, I still haven’t gotten the number and I’m starting to be very, very upset with them. This is a brand I loved and trusted and I’m hoping this is just a bad store. I’ve been to many, many Coach stores before and have always had lovely experiences. I just wanted to rant since I’m so disappointed how this all went. It was my first big in-store purchase. ",2025-03-27 02:03:32+00:00,19,21

1jjou6r,Coach,Gramercy Tote Bag Review,"This a long review i’m so sorry 😭 but there’s like no info on this bag online so I thought I’d give everyone a review.

 I saw this bag originally and liked it, but seeing the sides folded in on tiktok (like everyone else) had me sold! I just got it today in black and wore it all day. I’m as of now 50/50 on it. I am a LITTLE confused as to why it’s being marketed now as being versatile with styling and shaping it. It’s very hard to get the sides to fold in and doesn’t stay when you open it. Naturally it doesn’t sit like that. So it’s going to look uneven and messy. You have to train the bag to stay like that. It’s the same soft leather as the brooklyn which I love. If you like a structured neat bag this is NOT the bag for you. It’s super floppy and kind of molds to your body like the brooklyn 39. I love this bag and as of now am keeping it. 

However I do feel like the tiktoks of it being shaped differently are a little bit misleading. This overall is a beautiful bag and will age so nice over time. I would give it a 5/5 but the info online and the tiktoks are definitely misleading.",2025-03-25 17:23:08+00:00,364,31

1jip4ku,Coach,Help with nappa leather care for Coach quilted tabby 20,"Hey everyone!

This past Saturday, I was out shopping with my mom and absolutely fell in love with the Coach Quilted Tabby 20 in Chalk. I decided not to buy it because it’s quite expensive, but little did I know—my mom sneakily bought it for me as a surprise for my 30th birthday in September! I can’t wait!

Since Nappa leather is quite delicate, I’ve been looking through this subreddit for care tips. A few people recommended a YouTube video that suggests using a horsehair brush to condition the leather, but that makes me a bit nervous—wouldn’t that be too harsh? Has anyone here tried it?

The same video also recommended the Leather CPR Cleaner & Conditioner, but it costs €64 on Amazon (likely due to import costs from the U.S.). Does anyone know of a good alternative that’s more affordable and easier to find in Europe? I checked the Coach website, but they don’t seem to offer a leather conditioner atm.

Would really appreciate any advice—thanks in advance!",2025-03-24 12:10:10+00:00,6,8

1jihjzt,Coach,"My Turnlock Card Cases are here, and I think they are giving: quiet luxury, Coach edition!","I loved the black one so much, that I picked it up in the chalk color too! The nappa leather is gorgeous. There are no huge Coach logo’s anywhere (which I love), except for being inconspicuously engraved on the hardware and turnlocks. However, if you wanted to personalize them and add some hang tags or charms, you could do that too with the attachments in the back. The gold crossbody chains are detachable. These can also easily be used as bag charms or as a catch all in your bigger purse. I think it’s a cute and dainty date night purse, where you only carry the bare essentials (or mini sample versions of everything which is also so cute). It won’t fit a phone, but my phone is always in hand anyway. These were such nice outlet finds at $79 a pop! Love them. 😍🖤🤍

I noticed today that this little spot above the closure magnet bits is cracked/ripped on both sides :( I’m wondering if anyone else has had this issue? Is it something Coach can, or even will, fix?

1ji1e14,Coach,She’s a Beaut! 😍,"I went into the store yesterday to finally pick up the Empire 40 in Merlot. I tried on the bag and just found it to be a little too large for me, for now. I tried on the chain tabby 30 and I fell IN LOVE! 

It is absolutely gorgeous, the leather is luxurious. It’s the perfect combo of structured and slouchy. I don’t love the divided interior, but I’m so in love with the bag, I’m gonna make it work. There is a ton of room in this bag. I included a pic of what I have in it so far. Obv my phone would fit in as well. The wristlet is where I keep all my lip stuff, tampons, wet wipes, etc. so it is a decent size pouch. Also, the wallet is a little thick, so if you just use a card holder, you could save some room there too. The 30 could definitely hold a Kindle or smaller iPad for sure. 

The bag is a little on the heavy side, but also comes with a cross body strap if you don’t want to wear it on your shoulder. 

Rainbow heart charm also Coach. 
For demographic reference, I’m 47F and live in a northern suburb of Atlanta, GA!

1ji0btb,Coach,Bag Of The Day 🖤,"The Laurel is my go to! BUT, I need ideas for a spring bag. Black just isn’t cutting it this spring! Something similar to THIS though! Because I carry A LOT. ",2025-03-23 14:20:25+00:00,60,12
1ji08n9,Coach,bluebell brooklyn 28 ⭐️,"Such a cute blue color for the Spring / Summer! I’ll be honest, this is really just for styling purposes to show some of the fun ways to decorate this bag, but in practical use I just have the star coin pouch and sometimes the chunky chain for added flair! But I think the Fuschia looks really nice with the Bluebell!

I would like to think this pic shows a very accurate hue of this blue. If anyone is wondering, it isn’t as baby blue as the photos on the website. In person, it is much more of a mid-tone blue. That being said, I think this color is very fun esp going into summer but wish it was a little more baby blue so it could be worn more in the winter as well. ",2025-03-23 14:16:15+00:00,420,28

1jhsup9,Coach,"Scarf Wraps on bag handle, Good or Bad?",Hi! I just got myself an empire 40 and I’m not sure if wrapping a satin scarf on my handles will actually prevent scratches and oil transfer or actually hurt the leather due to lack of ventilation? Are bag scarfs are gimmick and for style or do they actually protect the bag? ,2025-03-23 06:14:11+00:00,7,6
