1ju2al8,C25K,Foot and Knee Pain. Feeling Discouraged and Close to Giving Up,"
I started training about a month ago and went two weeks straight, running every other day and starting really slow. But even with that gentle approach, I started having really bad pain in my feet and knees.

The pain in my feet is on the outer edge of my soles and sometimes in the arches. My left foot hurts more, but both have that same pain. My knees hurt too‚Äîmainly on the inner side. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I can‚Äôt even go 2‚Äì3 minutes without serious discomfort.

I took a full week off because of the pain. Today was my first day back, and I couldn‚Äôt even make it to the three-minute mark before the pain came back hard. I‚Äôve been really trying to be consistent, but I feel like it‚Äôs just getting worse.

I‚Äôm wearing good running shoes that I go within the last 8 months. Hokas 

I was hoping this would help my physical and mental health, but I‚Äôm honestly feeling really discouraged and close to giving up. Has anyone been through something similar or have any advice?",2025-04-08 01:47:45+00:00,3,2

1ju0hpu,Hoka,Hoka Help,"Hey all, I just want to start by saying I‚Äôve heard great things about Hokas and when I saw a pair of Bondi 8s for clearance I snatched them up! The box said they where a 8, I wear a 9, but looking at them now the shoe says US 11.5D. Whats with that? My foot fits fine, heal sits back and well, and about a inch or so of wiggle room for my toes.

Anyway, Ive been working my 8 hour shifts with them and they don‚Äôt hurt my feet after my shifts like numerous other shoes have. But they make my feet sore. Im used to breaking in new shoes/boots all the time and usually by this time of heavy wearing and usage my feet either get used to it, or they‚Äôve been broken in. Not these Hokas though‚Ä¶ my archs feel sore after all the support these shoes give them, but its only while wearing them, not walking around barefooted. I wore them tight at first. Then after this soreness I tried them a little loose and they feel definitely better.

Whats going on? Did i get the wrong size? Width? Style? Id like some help please. I stand at work all day, 8 hours a day on tile or hard carpet, nothing soft, and never sit. Thank you. ",2025-04-08 00:15:16+00:00,2,5

* **Adidas** \+ **Dover Street Market Paris** have upcoming collab with **Phil√©o**, April 9th, doing customized EVO SLs. Phil√©o is a young french footwear designer who has previously worked with Salomon and Comme Des Gar√ßons. This collab is a grunged up of the shoe, smeared with boot polish used to stain the upper and achieve a unique look on every shoe. ""The idea was to kind of imagine how asphalt would stain. I love how shoes look after having suffered an ultra trail. I wanted to imagine how that‚Äôd look in a civilized way."" - Phil√©o
* **SOAR** did a beautiful campaign with Alex Zono and Adriaan Louw called [""Country Boy"".](https://youtu.be/TcAoe-lVdIc) Per SOAR, this shoot was largely lead by Adriaan and the writers, SOAR just funded it and let them do their thing. All this marketing is a similar direction to On's Soft Wins.

1jtp711,beginnerrunning,Anyone else experience or have advice for foot numbness?,"I‚Äôve been running regularly for about 6 months and I‚Äôm currently training for my first half marathon in May. 

As I‚Äôve increased weekly mileage, I‚Äôve noticed an issue in my right foot where after a couple of miles I start experience numbness on the bottom of my foot, mostly under my big toe/ ball of my foot so a pretty localized area. 

I am assuming it‚Äôs a shoe issue so I‚Äôve gone to a local shoe store since I figured they could give me advice and direct me to a shoe that works for me. 

So far I‚Äôve tried:
- Brooks Ghost Max in regular size 
- Saucony Cohesion 13 in half size bigger
- Hoka Bondi 9 in half size bigger 
- Hoka Bondi 9 in half size bigger and wide version 
- New Balance Fresh Foam X 1080v13 in full size bigger and with an insert (thought maybe I have an arch issue?) 

I‚Äôm really at a loss so I wanted to see if anyone had any thoughts. Maybe it‚Äôs not a circulation issue and I‚Äôm doing something wrong with my form? 

All thoughts welcome, thanks in advance!!

1jtj2ys,RunningShoeGeeks,33 shoes tested for Energy Return and Energy Absorbed (Cushioning),"Measured using a linear electrodynamic actuator producing a sinusoidal force at 2Hz with an amplitude of 900N. Note that these measurements are sensitive to the different parameters of the test.

For heel, it is measured at 12% from the back. For forefoot,  65%.

Full table here: https://www.rtings.com/running-shoes/tools/table/163923

Regarding the choice of 900N, total force is around 2-3x body weight so higher than 900N. However, that force is spread across the foot and the way our measurement is done is only in one smaller area of the foot at a time, hence the lower values. It roughly correspond to 2 zones in that paper https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333451625_Comparison_of_plantar_loads_among_runners_with_different_strike_patterns (like M1+M2 for heel).

1jtcka1,WaltDisneyWorld,First-ever trip report!,"My family recently got back from a big vacation to Orlando (first time). Special thanks to this sub for all the help and advice! With this sub, Reddit Answers AI, Thrill-data, dozens of YouTube videos, and ChatGPT, we were able to navigate a once-in-a-lifetime vacation during spring break crowds. We don't know when we're going back, so I threw down to maximize our time.

Stayed at Pop Century. Perfect budget motel for crashing at night and getting to/from the parks easily.

Four days, one park per day. Learned the hard way that rest days are 100% necessary. By the second day, we had to adjust, and by the fourth day, people got sick and tired. Here are my family's favorites, ranked from best to least:

# Magic Kingdom

**Rides‚Äîlightning lane premier pass**

* TRON Lightcycle
* Seven Dwarfs Mine Train

*Classics*

* Pirates of the Caribbean
* Peter Pan's Flight
* Tiana‚Äôs Bayou Adventure
* Space Mountain
* It's a Small World
* Mad Tea Party
* Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin
* Dumbo
* Jungle Cruise
* The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh
* Haunted Mansion (kids voted this one down)

*Could've done without*

* Under the Sea \~ Journey of the Little Mermaid (protip: perfect for the family to ride while I waited in line at Gaston's tavern)
* Walt Disney World Railroad from Frontierland to Main St (easily ate up an hour of precious time)

**Food**

* Cinderella's Royal Table
* Gaston's Tavern
* Columbia Harbor House Dinner

**Experiences**

* Swiss Family Treehouse
* Mickey‚Äôs PhilharMagic
* Festival of Fantasy Parade
* Adventure Friends Cavalcade
* ~~Let the Magic Begin~~ sad this didn't happen

Learned the hard way: we had a point after our last ride, TRON, when we were happy and satisfied and should've gone back to the resort. Instead we cut across the park crowds for dinner, and then went hunting for those souvenirs we saw earlier. Bad end to a good day, adding hours to the end. If you want something, just buy it right then. Surprised at how bad the crowds got after 6pm on a Tuesday.

The premier pass let us do everything we wanted without stress, which was good for this once-ever trip.

# Hollywood Studios

This was a difficult day to plan, but it worked in the end. My earliest LL was for Tower of Terror, not until noon; other LLs were in the afternoon or evening, despite booking eight days in advance at 7am. Given how my kids reacted on Haunted Mansion, I canceled ToT, booked Frozen Sing Along for 9:30am, which allowed me to get MFSR shortly thereafter.

**Rides‚Äîlightning lane single & multipass (earliest times available/booked)**

* Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance (2pm LL)
* Slinky Dog Dash (5pm LL)
* Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run (noon LL)
* Mickey and Minnie‚Äôs runaway railway (rope dropped)
* Toy Story Mania! (3:30p LL)
* ~~Star Tours‚ÄîThe Adventures Continue~~ canceled; too tired

**Food**

* Sci-Fi Dine-In
* Woody‚Äôs lunchbox breakfast
* ~~Oga's Cantina~~ canceled; too tired

**Experiences**

* Met Chip & Dale
* Met Mandalorian
* Met Rey
* Saw Kylo Ren
* Frozen Sing-along
* Met Pluto
* Explored Galaxy‚Äôs Edge
* Saw Donald & Goofy
* Indiana Jones Stunt show
* Muppet\*Vision 3D
* Star Wars Launch Bay (not sure if we missed something here; I thought it'd be a museum, but we met BB-8 and saw a couple model planes?)

# EPCOT

**Rides‚Äîlightning lane single & multipass‚Äîall during the morning**

* Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind (favorite of all four parks for some of us)
* Remy's Ratatouille Adventure (rope dropped)
* Soarin' Around the World
* Frozen Ever After
* Spaceship Earth
* Living with the land
* The Seas with Nemo & Friends

Glad we did it all once; if we were to go back, we'd probably only do those top two again, so we could do more World Showcase.

**Food**

* Biergarten Restaurant
* Pineapple Dole Whip
* Violet Lemonade
* Maple Popcorn
* Tacos & Empanada

**Experiences**

* World Showcase‚Äîwish we had left more time and stomach space for this!
   * Germany
   * Norway
   * United Kingdom
   * Japan
   * France
   * Canada
   * Italy

# Animal Kingdom

We were pretty tired at this point. One kid requested a wheelchair.

**Rides‚Äîlightning lane single & multipass**

* Avatar: Flight of Passage
* Kilimanjaro Safaris
* Expedition Everest - Legend of the Forbidden Mountain (half of us sat this out)
* Na‚Äôvi River Journey

* ~~Yak & Yeti‚Ñ¢ Restaurant early dinner~~ canceled; too tired

**Experiences**

* Festival of the Lion King Show 

For anyone out there planning, the lightning lanes made the trip awesome with negligible wait times. Be flexible and ready to pivot. Listen to your party. One sit-down meal is more than enough; quick service has generous portions, too. Get snacks early in the morning when the lines are short if you're using lightning lanes for rides.

For nausea, I took dimenhydrinate (regular Dramamine) with a caffeine pill every 6‚Äì8 hours. The wife and kids took meclizine (less-drowsy Dramamine or Bonine) once daily. That worked well for us, along with taking breaks.

Being a fanny/waist-pack-only family worked really well (Osprey). Bought everyone two good shoes and rotated them daily. I loved my New Balance Fresh Foam X 1080v14 for the cushion/bounce and Hoka Clifton 9 for the firmness. The wife and kids did New Balance, Saucony, ASICS. The wife bought everyone silicone shoe covers for Tiana's; hard to say if they helped‚Äîone splash on the ankle and the whole sock is wet; maybe they would've helped if there had been any rain.

**Regrets:**

Wish we had planned a rest day; I thought mid-day breaks would be enough; they weren't. I learned just how much ""fun"" we can cram in. My family chose early mornings, so we didn't get to see any fireworks. Sad that some of Disney Food Blog's favorite snacks were dishes you had to get at a restaurant, as opposed to food from a stand.",2025-04-07 04:02:42+00:00,6,0
1jtb84i,triathlon,My Oceanside Half Ironman Report (first triathlon ever),"I'm hoping this report will help newbies with this triathlon because while there are lots of info on the internet on how to be super efficient at swimming, biking, running and transitions, there's hardly any info on how to do a triathlon if your only aim is to finish and you don't care about your time (too much) and there‚Äôs no info about the logistics.
 
 
**My Goals**
 
* Don't drown
 
* Beat the swim and T1 cutoff times
 
* Finish the race
 
 
 
**My background**
 
I'm a 48 year old male roadie and I used to dabble in half marathons. I had never seriously swam before and had only lounging around pools and snorkeling. My weak point is the swim and despite training for almost 2 years, the best time I can sustain is only 2:30 per 100 meters. For training, I did mostly pool but managed to get in about half a dozen lake swims in 60 degF water. Definitely get in some open water experience, preferably cold water and preferably salt water. 
 
 
**Friday Check-in Day**
 
I got to the check-in at 9am on Friday and it was a full day. Packet pickup was pretty smooth and the volunteers were very helpful. Youtube shows that Ironman gives out plastic bags for the bike, run, and special needs bags, but that doesn't happen for this 70.3. They only give out 1 bag for all your stuff. 

After this, my friend and I found a beach to test the waters since this would be our first time swimming in the ocean and at a temp this cold (57 degF). There is no official Ironman designated place for practice swimming in the harbor. We were only in the water for about 10 minutes to get a feel for things and then headed back to the airbnb, showered, and found a restaurant for breakfast.

During bike drop off, you only leave your bike there. You do not setup your area until the morning of the race. Also because there are 3000 people doing this race, bikes are crammed right next to each other so your area is pretty small. If you have a lot of stuff like I did then there's hardly any room to make an efficient area (more on this later).

With all the meetings we wanted to go to and walking around Ironman Village, we were finally done around 4:30p. 


**Race Day Setup**
 
My plan was to get to the transition area at 5:30a by using the shuttles. However, the shuttles had a different plan for me. I was at the parking garage by 5a and I had just missed a shuttle (they're school buses). I think I ended up waiting for another 20 minutes for the next one and by that time there were a ton of people in line. Luckily, 2 buses showed up but it was still standing room only in our first bus. 

I chose to wear my wetsuit, half on the during this time. I figured it would keep my legs warm and I would wear a Tshirt and sweatshirt on top. In the end, I needed 2 sweatshirt to keep warm. Having grown up in the area I knew what to expect but I swear after moving to Phoenix and getting older, I've lost my resistance to the cold. Lots of people were wearing sweat pants and shoes or sandals. 

It was slow going through traffic at the harbor and I finally got to my bike at 6am. This was still plenty of time to get my area setup by the 6:30 cutoff time. As mentioned before, I didn't care about my T1, T2 times. As long as I made the swim cutoff, I knew I was good. 

For the bike, I despise being cold on the bike so I had knee warmers, arm warmers, full finger gloves, half finger gloves and a vest for the bike. This all paid off later. I also had two small towels, one to sit on and one to dry myself off. You don't need two, just sit on the ground and dry yourself off. I also had a full body wipe that I could use to wipe off the sticky ocean film from my feet, legs and hands. I don't think I would do this again because I don't think I could tell much difference. Oh and I didn't have a tri suit, so I had tri shorts and a biking jersey.

For the run, I had my hat, toe socks (I get blisters between my toes without them), Hokas, run shirt, and leash for my sunglasses so they stay tight to my face.

As you can see, this was a lot of stuff and very little room around the bike to setup. What I ended up doing was setting up as much as I could on the bike and kept the rest in a grocery bag next to the bike. Then all the running stuff went into another grocery bag next to the bike.

With that all settled, my friend and I headed out to the bathrooms and then met up with my wife to hand her our phones and pump. By this time, it was about 6:30a so I found the line to the ramp. Pro tip, the permanent bathrooms have shorter lines than the porta potties. 

I had neoprene booties which were a godsend. I definitely recommend wearing them. Some people had the neoprene caps too. The line was already pretty long but I slipped through to find my projected finish time and placed myself in the 46-50 min zone. Obviously by this time I had my wetsuit on fully but I also chose to keep my sweatshirt which I think was also a good choice. When we finally made it to the ramp, I threw the sweatshirt in the donation pile. 

**The Swim**
 
The water was cold, but within about 30 seconds I got used to it. I never freaked out and just got to work. I purposefully kept to the outside to avoid other swimmers and this strategy paid off. There were a few bottleneck sections where I got boxed in by swimmers passing me and I had people tickling my feet, but I never got kicked or hit. People talk about the sun being blinding (and it was) but I didn't think it was a problem because I could always see where everyone else was going and every once in a while I could make out a buoy. My swim took me 51m so I'd say I chose my coral pretty well for my first tri.

I can't stress this enough, make sure to get in some open water swimming before this!

**T1**
 
I got out of the water and got the upper half of the wetsuit off. They had strippers at the end and I made use of them (wetsuit strippers, you weirdos). When I got to my bike, I dried off with my towel and wiped down my legs, hands and arms with the full body wipe I had. Then I started putting on my knee warmers and arm warmers which were kinda hard to do since I was still damp, but I got them on. After putting sunscreen on my face and neck, I got on my sweatband, helmet, sox, shoes, jersey and half finger gloves. I was going to wear full finger gloves, then switch out for half finger gloves later, but decided it was warm enough that I only needed my half finger gloves. In total it took me 7m 14s in transition and my goal was less than 10 minutes.

**The Bike**
 
The bike leg was pretty cool! Starting off was a little chilly so I was glad I had on my warm clothes. I've read stories here about people who were freezing for 30 minutes and I wanted to avoid that. I was warm in about 5 minutes and I was stripping off things at about the 30 min mark. Keep in mind that I'm a roadie so I can take most things off without stopping. 

I thought riding through Camp Pendleton was the coolest thing ever and the weather was perfect. 

On top of being a roadie, I also specialize in hill climbing so I didn't think the hills were that bad. I saw lots of people walking or zig zagging. However, knowing me, I always push myself to ride 100% on hills and I knew I had to pace myself this time. I think I rode about about 80-90%. Mostly I just tried to enjoy the ride, the views, and Base life.

Contrary to many complaints, I didn't see any purposeful drafting. There were no road trains going and nobody was following anybody else within 1-2 feet like I would normally do during a road race. Sure, there were bottle necks where people clumped together but you really can't avoid that with this many people, plus when it opened up again, everybody spread out again. 

There were a couple people passing in the No Pass zones, but oh well, can't do much about that. 

In the 25 mph speed zone, I tried to keep it to 22-23 mph and had one guy fly by me. When he passed the second radar, it said he was doing 31 mph. I think he realized something was wrong so he slowed down, but that had to be too late and I'm sure he got DQ'd. 

I did the bike leg in about 3h 20m with 1 stop for the bathroom and another stop to fill up water (which I ended up not needing).

**T2**
 
T2 was uneventful. I came in, racked the bike, got my running gear on and off I went. The one thing I wish I did was start my watch at the exit timing mat and not at the bike rack. Because of that, my mile markers were off.

**The Run**
 
I knew this was going to be the toughest part for me because I couldn't train like I should have. From past experience I knew that if I trained too much for the run, I would kill my knees and then I would have a long term injury and I wouldn't even be able to do the run at all. So for training I limited myself to 4-5 miles and often on a nice cushy treadmill. 

Things were going ok at first...I was doing a 10min/mile pace but I was targeting 11min/mile so I figured I should slow it down. At about the 5 mile mark, my knee did indeed start to act up so that was a bad sign. Also I was starting to get hot spots on my feet which were unusual. 

I also hate loops because I think they're demoralizing, but the crowd and running on the beach can't be beat. It was a pretty cool atmosphere. But in the end, I ended up walking a lot of the second half, which I knew was a possibility and was perfectly acceptable for me. Remember my goal here was to finish the race. I finished the run in about 3 hours.

**After Race Logistics**
 
Now, what's the best way to get your stuff from the transition area? I don't know, but I don't think it was using the shuttles. My wife and I ended up taking the shuttle to the transition area and then waiting for the shuttle to pick us up, including the bike. It was getting late and we weren't sure if the shuttle was coming back so we ended up walking 1 mile back to our car. 

I think if I were to do it again, I would take a big backpack, like the one Ironman gives you as part of the package, and take the shuttle to the transition area. Then put all your stuff into the backpack and bike back to the car. All this might be different if you finish much earlier than I did. 

**Conclusions**
 
Overall it was a very stressful part of my life but in a good way. It was a new experience and a journey into the unknown. It forced me to learn a new skill and pushed the boundaries of my comfort zone. This was a bucket list item and I always knew it would be a one time deal. If I had a choice, I would absolutely go back and do it again; I have no regrets. However, having said that, I am now retired!",2025-04-07 02:47:17+00:00,18,1

Stayed at Loews Royal Pacific for the Express Passes. Lobby was 10/10. Rooms felt like normal hotel rooms, like a Marriott.

2-Park, 2-Day tickets (no Epic üòî) with a rest day between (learned that rest days are 100% necessary). We crammed a lot in two days. Here are my family's favorites, ranked from best to least:

For anyone out there planning, we only had energy to do one of each ride on any day. The express passes made the trip awesome with negligible wait times. We were at security by 7am each day to be on Hagrid's at park open. Be flexible and ready to pivot. Listen to your party.

Shout out to [this blog](https://morethanthursdays.com/diy-hogwarts-letter-printable/) for the DIY Hogwarts acceptance letters we used to announce the trip to the kids.

For nausea, I took dimenhydrinate (regular Dramamine) with a caffeine pill every 6‚Äì8 hours. The wife and kids took meclizine (less-drowsy Dramamine or Bonine) once daily. That worked well for us, along with taking breaks between the worst dizzying rides. I used a scopolamine patch the first day, but I had blurry vision and couldn't read the next day, so I removed it (I swear I didn't touch my eyes; it was just the anticholinergic side effect). The dry mouth with the patch is real.

Being a fanny/waist-pack-only family worked really well (Osprey). Bought everyone two good shoes and rotated them daily. I loved my New Balance Fresh Foam X 1080v14 for the cushion/bounce and Hoka Clifton 9 for the firmness. The wife and kids did New Balance, Saucony, ASICS. The wife bought everyone silicone shoe covers; hard to say if they helped on the rides‚Äîone splash on the ankle and the whole sock is wet; maybe would've helped if we had rain.

## Why the Right ‚Å£Shoes Matter‚Äç for‚Äå Treadmill‚Å£ Workouts

Before we dive into our‚Å£ recommendations, let's understand ‚Å¢why choosing the right shoes for treadmill running is so important. Unlike outdoor running, treadmill workouts offer a ‚Å§consistent, controlled environment.Though,the repetitive impact of‚Å£ your feet hitting the belt can still put significant strain on your joints and muscles. The best treadmill shoes are‚Äå designed to mitigate this impact through key ‚Å§features:

* ‚Äå  **Cushioning:** Adequate impact absorption is paramount for protecting your joints, especially your knees and ankles.‚Äå Cushioned running ‚Äãshoes can ‚Å¢drastically reduce the stress from each foot strike.
*‚Å¢   ‚Å¢**Support:** Proper foot support, including arch support, is essential for maintaining stability ‚Äçand preventing overpronation or supination, which‚Å£ can lead ‚Äãto injuries‚Äå like plantar fasciitis. ‚Å¢Stability running ‚Äãshoes are excellent for correcting your posture while running.
*   **Breathability:** Indoor workouts can get sweaty quickly.The best shoes for indoor ‚Äårunning ‚Äåfeature breathable materials‚Äç that wick away moisture, keeping your‚Å£ feet cool and comfortable.
* ‚Äå  **Grip and Traction:** While a treadmill belt provides a relatively ‚Äåstable surface,good grip is still ‚Äçimportant for preventing slippage‚Äç and maintaining control,especially during faster ‚Å¢speeds or incline workouts. Poor ‚Å¢traction can cause slips and possibly injuries.
*   **Durability:** Treadmill shoes should be able to withstand the ‚Å¢repetitive impact of indoor‚Å£ running. Look‚Å£ for durable materials and construction‚Å§ that will hold up over time.

1jt9gcf,Marathon_Training,London marathon pacing advice,"Hey everyone, looking for some guidance on pacing for an upcoming marathon (London). I‚Äôve just wrapped up the final long run of a 16-week plan, but the past few weeks haven‚Äôt gone as smoothly as I hoped.

I was originally aiming for a finish between 3:20 and 3:28. However, my recent long runs have felt harder than expected. I‚Äôve struggled to hold marathon pace blocks (4:50/km x2 for 9km) and had to drop to around 5:00‚Äì5:10/km.

I‚Äôve been training at altitude (~2300m) in temps between 17‚Äì24¬∞C. While acclimatised, I still can‚Äôt push my heart rate like I can at sea level. That said, I‚Äôm hoping London‚Äôs cooler temps and lower altitude will work in my favour.

Some background:
- 38M, 80kg

- Running for 3.5 years

- 3 half marathons (most recent: 1:45 at altitude)

- 1 full marathon (3:50, also at altitude)

- Weekly km: 37, 44, 48, 57, 56, 36, 62, 64, 68, 38, 73, 77

- each week I do 2 easy runs 2 speed runs and 1 long run with 

- I have done 4 long runs over 30km

- Training in Vomero 17 and Hoka Mach 6, will be racing in Alphafly

I don‚Äôt want to go out too fast and blow up, but I also don‚Äôt want to be overly conservative and miss out on a decent time. Any advice on how to realistically pace this race would be hugely appreciated!

Thanks in advance!

1jt72yg,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Help with new shoe query RE: shin pain,"

Hi, 

Hope someone with more experience with a variety of shoes could  help. 

Main question is at the bottom if you want to skip :)

I recently purchased a pair of Adidas boston 12's as I had seen some very good reviews on YouTube for them. 
The first time I wore them I got terrible shin splint type pain from a 2km run. 

For  context 2 days later I ran the sheffield half marathon in a pair of Hoka Mach X which gave no pains whatsoever (also managed a PB :) 

I also have in my rotation Inov8 roadfly, on cloudsurfer, scarpa ribelle run, hoka tecton x, pegasus trail 5, all of which give no pains.

I read that the laces on the boston 12'S can cause lockdown issues so purchased some different laces to perform a proper racers knot. I've been out for 2 more runs in the bostons which did cause some pain, but not quite to the same extent. 

My main question is, do I persevere with the bostons with the view that my muscles/tendons etc are adapting to a new stimulus, or do I move on from these and realise they're just not a shoe that suits me? 

I was also looking at getting a pair of adios pro 3s as my training schedule is starting to pick up with a view to doing more races,  but I'm worried I'll have the same reaction to them as I have the bostons ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

1jt5byv,PlantarFasciitis,Link between peri-menopause and Plantar Fasciitis?,"I (48F) have been symptomatic with PF for 14 months. I suspect I've had it longer but that it had been masked by a medication I was on for several years (Cymbalta). I was prescribed Cymbalta for depression,  but it's also prescribed for pain in many cases. I weaned off due to the many side effects I encountered.  

So far, I've tried the following treatments: hokas, ortho inserts, high arch house shoes, no barefoot walking, oral steroids, 2 cortisone injects (lead to injection site atrophy, terrible), PT (6 weeks), daily hip, calf, foot stretches, night splints, calf and foot massage, and for the last 3 weeks I've been in a walking boot for approximately 70-80% of the day. While some of these treatments have provided temporary relief, the pain still persists. 

The podiatrist has mentioned Shockwave therapy as a possible next step, but in the same breath he also says that it has a 50-80 % effective rate, it's not covered by insurance and doctors are unsure why it works on some people and not others. Not very reassuring. 

I spent the last several weeks trying to think out of the box about why I have not been able to crack the code, and the only thing I could really come up with as if there was a link to perimenopause and foot pain. I know peri can cause joint pain and body aches.

1jt1cxv,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Cielo X1 and Hoka Cielo X1 2.0 comparison,"Hoka Cielo X1 (2024)

US13

Fit/Comfort Notes: True to size. Advertised as narrow, but actually fits wider than most Hokas. The upper is stiff and not the most comfortable. Lockdown is decent, but the stock laces are bad. Overall, not a plush fit, but secure enough for long efforts.

Use Case: Used primarily for races: half-marathons and a full Ironman marathon. Also tested on long road runs (20+ km).

Distance Ran: ~350 km (~217 miles)

Reason For Buying: Looking for a race-legal shoe with high cushioning and stability for long-course triathlon. Switched from Nike after being disappointed by Vaporfly (too unstable, narrow platform) and Invincible 3 (heel slippage, uncomfortable upper).

Personal Observations:

One of the most cushioned racing shoes available ‚Äì extremely protective even at 110+ kg (240+ lbs). Aggressive rocker helps maintain turnover late into long efforts. Solid stability and support over long distances, especially post biking in Ironman. Outsole durability is excellent ‚Äì full rubber coverage except for a strange bare section on the back heel.

Downsides: stiff upper, subpar laces, and the fit is wider than expected. Weight is higher than typical super shoes, but irrelevant at my body weight ‚Äì the overall support more than compensates.

Comparisons: Far more supportive than Vaporfly/Alphafly for mid-pack and heavier runners. I trained mostly in Asics Superblast 2, which complemented it well (but those aren‚Äôt Ironman legal). Cielo X1 was my go-to race shoe for 2024.

Hoka Cielo X1 2.0 (2025)

US13

Fit/Comfort Notes: True to size. Massive improvement in the upper: better heel structure, more breathable, and slightly narrower ‚Äì now it actually fits like a modern race shoe. Laces are traditional and work better. Still roomy for a super shoe, but much improved over v1.

Use Case: Used for tempo runs

Distance Ran: ~21 km (~13 miles)

Reason For Buying: Was excited about the updated version hoping for same midsole performance with improved fit and comfort. Looked like a perfect evolution on paper.

Personal Observations:

Upper changes are great ‚Äì fit and lockdown issues from v1 are solved. Unfortunately, the midsole took a hit. Foam under the heel has been reduced both in width and volume, and outsole cuts are much deeper. This causes instability in the heel ‚Äì noticeable even during walking. During runs, it forces a midfoot/forefoot strike, which I can manage up to ~15 km, but after that my form degrades and I rely more on my heel ‚Äì something v1 handled much better. I don‚Äôt trust v2 over longer distances or during the Ironman marathon. My concerns were confirmed by several YouTube reviewers (lighter runners too), who also noted instability. One key design change was moving the midsole cut from lateral to medial side ‚Äì similar to Adios Pro 3. The difference is that Adios has a stiffer heel and isn‚Äôt as prone to compression. For me (slight supinator), the change might help theoretically, but the execution doesn‚Äôt work at heavier weight.

Comparisons: Cielo X1 2.0 feels like a different shoe altogether. Better fit, worse stability. Compared to v1, it‚Äôs less suited for heavy runners or fatigued form. I chose to return it and stick with Mach X2 for training and Cielo X1 for racing. It‚Äôs a shame the original wasn‚Äôt kept in the lineup alongside X1 2.0 and Rocket ",2025-04-06 18:48:49+00:00,45,21
1jsziql,Hoka,Did they change the Mach line?,"A little backstory.. I‚Äôm not much of a runner but I‚Äôm on my feet all day at work and I do walk a paved trail often. Anyway, the Mach 4 was a game changer for me.. it was the first show where my feet didn‚Äôt hurt no matter how long I was on them ! 

Those are obviously old, so I‚Äôve purchased both mach 5 and now 6 since and my feet THROB so badly during the day and after I take them off. I got home from work Friday and couldn‚Äôt even make dinner my feet hurt so badly.

1jsu362,rs_x,i recently got a fat sugar daddy,"sort of an L post but he spoils me so‚Ä¶.

went through a rough breakup with my bf last month so i (26m) downloaded grindr again and have had some nice dates with a wealthy (think tens of millions) yet rather portly 52 year old man- here are some lifestyle habits i‚Äôve noticed:

for one, he doesn‚Äôt do any laundry or iron his clothes yet also doesn‚Äôt hire a cleaner of any sort- he just donates or simply throws away dirty clothes & orders new ones with overnight delivery off amazon‚Ä¶ not to mention he‚Äôs got frankly horrible taste in fashion, think of a dc guy wearing patagonia, polyester polos, & leather ‚Äúdress‚Äù sneakers or hokas. last night, after we had sex he doordashed two birria tacos & a large torta at 1:30am & ate all of it in the living room as i laid in bed, my thoughts shrouded in a mix of moderate disgust & post-fuck clarity. also, he‚Äôs somewhat of an oaf- he‚Äôll sometimes belch loudly after habitually eating his food too fast (when we‚Äôre out in public no less!), fart & snore when we‚Äôre in bed, & sneeze without covering his mouth.

ik! i should have more standards & self-respect even being a üö¨ but he spoils me (he bought me some stuff from rick owens & watanabe the other day, among other examples lol) and he‚Äôs really sweet & funny, kind of like a fruity john candy‚Ä¶ all things considered should i really be with this man any longer?

Da meine Laufstrecken aber sehr viele Kurven und abfallende Fu√üwege beinhalten, brauche ich einen Schuh der das wegd√§mpft statt in engen Kurven zu ‚Äûblockieren‚Äú.

1jshjff,DiagnoseMe,What‚Äôs wrong with my ankle/foot? This is driving me nuts,"31 male, 5‚Äô10‚Äù 165 lbs, California. Mostly healed herniated disc in my back and umbilical hernia to be repaired. Some palpitations caused by stress and caffeine. Not on any meds besides OTC painkillers and supplements, and I work on my feet in retail.

A few months after my back injury in August, I started getting a feeling of weakness in my left ankle but ignored the symptoms. It returned recently as I was trying to walk more and change up my shoes as I had worn my HOKAs daily since the injury‚Äî pain in the front ankle and by the Achilles. I visited an urgent care doctor who told me to go back to wearing HOKAs and walk less, and all was well.

I visited a friend‚Äôs 5k event days later and didn‚Äôt anticipate the sheer volume of walking involved, and later in the day I felt a shock of sharp pain in the top of my foot, towards the toes. It was incapacitating. 

I suspected extensor tendonitis despite the lack of injury, redness, or swelling. I consulted some athlete friends and one who was a PT‚Äôs assistant, who all said the same thing: new shoes, RICE, and calf exercises. I was also told that the tingling twang I felt during stretches sometimes was a good thing.

I followed their advice with gradual improvement but today, I was doing stretches at work, feeling the twang when I had to jump up for a rush. In a second I felt pins and needles all over my foot and lower leg, followed by numbness, warmth, and various combinations of the three. 

Needless to say, I‚Äôm scared as this was unprecedented, and any comfort or words of wisdom would be appreciated.

1jsh423,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Help! Every running shoe I've owned feels too firm underfoot. Am I wearing the wrong shoes?,"Hi all.

I started running in 2020 with $60 pair of Adidas Supercloud running shoes. Back then I knew nothing about running shoes and just bought a cheap pair in a colour I liked. I jogged 1000km in those over 2 years, running no more than 5km at a time.

Then I signed up for a 10km event and decided to get 'proper' running shoes. Went into a running shoe store and was recommended a pair of Brooks Adrenaline 21s. I ran another 1000km in them over 1 year, this time running some half marathons, a marathon and a 100km ultra.

However my right knee started hurting after runs, and I had to take a month off to recover.

At this time I read some online reviews and decided give Brooks Ghost 13 a try. I ran 500km in them before my knee pains came back.

So I then proceeded to try Brooks Glycerin 19 (meant to be better cushioned than Adrenalines and Ghosts although not quite 'max cushion'). I was quite happy with them though and ran 700km in them.

Now I rotate between HOKA Skyflow and Glycerin 20 for my weekly total of 40km (10km, 10km, 20km).

However I never found that any of these shoes felt plush underfoot. They feel quite firm. Glycerin 20s are supposed to be well cushioned, and some reviews state that Skyflows are 'max cushioned' shoes.

Do I have to get HOKA Bondis to finally feel that 'marshmallow' feeling underfoot? Many reviews criticise them for lack of responsiveness so I'm not sure it's worth it. Or do I need to pay $$$ and go for Glycerin Max or HOKA Cielo?

I am a jogger more than a serious runner (PB HM 1:59), and do value shoes that allow me to do long slow runs without knee pain afterwards. Essentially every run I do would be classified as 'slow recovery runs' by most runners, at around 6min/km pace.

Thanks for reading and would appreciate any tips.",2025-04-05 23:51:16+00:00,6,22

1jsda2t,PacificCrestTrail,Shoe change up,"Is it a bad idea to change from a Hoka Speedgoat to a Topo Ultraventure two weeks before starting the PCT? Both are a 5mm drop.

Hokas have fit fine and been comfortable for 15 mile practice hikes, I‚Äôve got 300 miles of practice hikes on them without issue until I added injinji toe sock liners. With the liners, I feel the narrow toe box and can tell I‚Äôd lose my pinky toes nails eventually. I was a little surprised how dramatically different it felt. I tried the Topos with the double sock lineup and it was so comfortable, but I‚Äôm worried about changing with so little time to see how they feel.

I got there a couple of days early as it was my first time visiting and I wanted to do some touristy stuff. I used two bagsmart medium compression packing cubes and the 20"" carry-on from Quince. the decathlon rolltop fit my toiletries, tech stuff, and misc items.

**regrets:**

* the wool sweater was nice but was pretty bulky! I only wore it once
* I don't really like the fit of the airism tshirt and didn't remember until I wore it - it feels too tight in the neck and weird in the shoulders. only wore it once, could've done without
* my sneakers weren't great for a lot of walking - got foot pain easily and not sure if they're too old. I was debating between these and some hokas I got a few months ago, but the hokas feel kind of tight so I wasn't sure about them
* didn't need a the extra usb-c or lightning charging cables I brought
* could've done without the kipling bag - I used it for 2 days at the event and because it was large, it had to go thru the additional security scan. I thought it'd be good for packing more snacks/food, but managed to fit those in my jacket pockets or arrived early enough at practices that I was allowed to take them in
* didn't need the microfiber towel, bike shorts, or beanie, but they didn't take up too much room
* jeans - I only wore them on travel days. I don't think I really like them for day-to-day? might nix them for future trips
* makeup - I didn't bring a lot but I never wear makeup regularly so I didn't use any of it other than the no sebum powder

**wins:**

* love the dark red fleece jacket!! it's actually from the men's section and I wore it almost every day. there are two deep pockets on the inside that I used to sneak in sandwiches and a small water bottle, and was also good for keeping my wallet/keys/misc items close
* almost didn't bring the hoodie but it rained on one of the days so I'm glad I had it! the puffer was also nicely waterproof
* the crossbody bag fit a lot more than I expected and because it was small, I didn't have to go thru the extra security screening for the rest of the event. I tied my scarf to the strap when I wasn't using it
* skirt/dress (both with pockets) + leggings was nice!
* I got my period while on the trip and using up all the pads I packed made some space in my suitcase for traveling back - was able to put my toiletries bag in my suitcase
* the cloth bag I packed my socks in helped compress the puffer jacket for the trip back!
* the 5ml bottles were just right for my skincare stuff
* I usually wouldn't bring the aquaphor or body lotion but my cheeks got flaky and hands got really dry from the cold and sore from clapping so I'm glad I did
* I don't like using body wash so I cut a bar of soap in half and used that with a mini soap holder from dollar tree. I probably could've cut it into thirds or quarters instead since half was a lot. was pretty happy with this but might look into something that doesn't have me setting it on the floor of the shower
* loop earplugs!! the stadium's music was really loud and they helped offset it + the crowd
* really liked the anker zolo power bank! I used it to get my phone from 20-30% to 70-80% in the evenings while at the event. it used about 25% each time, I think? I only charged it once during the trip
* I feel like I packed the right amount of clothes!

most of my souvenirs were small or flat so I had no trouble packing those. I did buy two books and they fit comfortably in my backpack on the way back. I'm from FL and not used to the cold so I was a bit worried but overall I'm pretty happy with how I packed and with the trip!

I mostly lurk on here but got a lot of great tips. grateful for this sub!! ü´∂",2025-04-05 19:59:55+00:00,132,28

While I was laid up I purchased a pair of Hoka Arahi 6 shoes as they were listed as a stability shoe and I presumed that would help with rehabbing my ankle. Since then I‚Äôve played around with zero drop and barefoot type shoes. I‚Äôve noticed that while wearing my minimalist shoes I don‚Äôt get much for foot pain outside of some heel and ball soreness which I assume is because of lack of cushioning and reduction in impact . But when I‚Äôm wearing my hokas, my bottom feet muscles get sore as if they‚Äôre almost working harder? Idk if the softer sole causes them to move and grip more than minimalist shoes? Minimalist shoes are always marketed as ‚Äústrengthening your feet muscles‚Äù? I primarily wear the hokas when walking a lot and/or going to be on my feet for long periods. The muscles I‚Äôm referring to are between the heel and ball both in the arch and on the outside of my foot as well as some tightness in my calf. There some sensation of the PF at the base of the heel. The pain overall isn‚Äôt brutal or unbearable but they‚Äôre soar compared to some of my other shoes.

I‚Äôve tried hokas and no matter how many times I try them, I just feel like I‚Äôm walking in scuba flippers. Also they seem heavy despite the foam. 

My favorite shoe used to be Nike Pegasus almost 10 years ago, but I tried their new model and the sole is a hard cheap plastic, no more classic bouncy rubber.

1jsaeii,trailrunning,Size up or not? Hoka Speedgoat 6,"Hey, I have been considering getting the Hoka Speedgoat 6 for light trail running and longer hikes.

This is the first time I'm buying dedicated footwear (always just used conventional trainers).

I tried them on in a shop and the guy there recommended I size up because when going downhill it would be hard on my toes.

Elsewhere I have read the the speedgoat 6 fit true to size, so I don't have a clear idea if I should listen to the general guidance of the shopkeeper or the specific review of this brand.

For reference, my normal shoe size is EU46, in the shop I tried on an 11.5 (equivalent to EU46) and it felt very comfortable and fit well (toes weren't touching edge, unless I pressed them forward and raised them a bit).  
I tried on the size 12.5 and they also felt okay, though a little bit less secure around the ankle. 

Unfortunately the shop didn't have a size 12 for me to try.

My question is, should I just get the size 11.5 that felt right, or follow the advise of sizing up and get a size 12 ?",2025-04-05 18:42:15+00:00,4,10

Most of Nike and Adidas' manufacturing happens in Asia (China, Vietnam) - is that also the case for the likes of Hoka and Saucony? 

They interviewed the creator of Sole Review who said companies might opt to use more EVA in their shoes (presumably the core models rather than racing lines!) or only cycle their shoes every 3-4 years rather than 1-2 years.

1jrxatd,PlantarFasciitis,Gastroc release surgery. Any advice?,"I've been battling chronic plantar Fasciitis for the past 11 years.
Had congenitally tight tendons and was a toe-walker in my early childhood. So I'm diagnosed with

Chronic Planters Fasciitis, Posterior Tibial Tendonitis, Pes Planus (flat feet), Joint Pain. 
The pain is like a hot burning ache that behind in the arch and gets worse as I walk more or do more. Making being employed very difficult.

I've gone through everything:
- Ibuprofen
- NSAIDs
- Meloxicam
- Zipsor
- KT Taping
- Physical Therapy (stretching, strength, scraping)
- Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy / ESWT
- Cortisone injections
- OTC pathetic inserts
- Custom orthotic inserts
- Custom AFO ""Richie"" style brace
- Hokas, New Balance, Oofoos, Birkenstocks
- Night Splints
- Foot Massagers
- Extra Strength Tylenol
- Tri-lock ankle foot brace
- Physical Therapy

It's gotten to the point that I needed a wheelchair to get through my shift at my previous job. (10hr shifts,  4 days in a row, constant walking.)

Ended up losing the job because my manager didn't think I needed to use a wheelchair, probably thought I was just being lazy or exaggerating. But this chronic pain is DEBILITATING. 

I finally have Medicaid since I moved from Texas over to CO and the state actually has some resources for poor impoverished cripples like me. 
So they did a Gait analysis, and determined that I would benefit from custom orthotics, new shoes, and possible Gastroc Release surgery.

I'm apprehensive about surgery. 
And I'm afraid that it may not cure my pain at all.

Has anyone here had the surgery done? 
Would you say that or cured you? Or that it had any benefits? What was your hearing journey like?",2025-04-05 06:36:42+00:00,6,1

1jrwiu8,sesamoid,Progress/update/small wins after 7 weeks in a moonboot,"Partial success story as I'm still very much in the early stages of recovery. I'm 7-8 weeks post injury (suspected pre-stress fracture of the sesamoid/ severe sesamoiditis) and things are slowly starting to improve. I know there is a huge risk of set backs with this condition so I'm taking things VERY slow. And some days are worse than others. Some days my anxiety gets the better of me and I'm convinced I'm back to square one but I rest and do the things I've listed below, and it returns back to baseline within a few days. 

I'll break down where I started, where I am now, and what I've been doing to help. 

Where I started 7-8 weeks ago: sharp pain under sesamoid, unable to stand, felt like a sharp marble. Unable to weightbear or walk. Pain along the arch under my foot. Even the moonboot hurt. 

Where I am now: mild ache level 1-2 pain/10 when walking around the apartment in hokas with carbon plates (waiting on orthotics) . Standing more painful, maybe a 3-4/10. 
Still less than 800-1000 steps per day.
I don't leave the house unless it's for an appointment 

I'm gradually learning to walk again (only around the apartment)  as I've only just transitioned out of the moon boot 5 days ago. 
No outings yet. 

What I've done so far (week 1-7) and things that I think definitely helped! 
- moonboot with extra padding/cut out hole under sesamoid/ball of foot
- staying off my feet as much as possible! (Only walked in moonboot when absolutely necessary) 
- contrast baths every night
- elevating my foot as much as possible
- not able to drive as right foot, so pretty much housebound
- wheelchair for longer outings 
- daily non weightbearing pilates and stretches 
- lots of help/babysitting with my toddler, doing as little activity as possible! 


Last two weeks:
- very slow transition out of boot to hokas with carbon plates. Sesamoid is achey but manageable if I keep steps low . Still resting as much as possible. Contrast baths every night.
- did an orthotic assessment. Walked barefoot for it and it flared up my sesamoid back to a 6/7 out of 10 for a day or two! Rested and iced it and now it's back to a 1-3/10. 
- orthotics will be ready later this week 

Things I'll be trying soon:
-orthotics 
- gradually introducing PT/physio approved movements ( I've tried a few gentle stretches but it's flared up the pain so I'm not ready for that yet) 
- a gradual return to walking program as I need to be on my feet 8 hours a day from end up June (midwife Prac)

Personal things to note that may have slowed /helped my recovery:
- I am 30 (relatively young?) and was previously quite an active stay at home mum, training to be a midwife . I didn't listen to my body when I had pain so that's how I got the pre stress fracture

- I am hypermobile and have a connective tissue disease which can sometimes slow healing
- I have reynauds (a circulation issues to the extremities - hands and feet- which can also effect healing) 

Improtant to remember: LISTEN TO YOUR BODY. everyone is different. 
- I saw two podiatrists and both wanted me out of the boot within 1-3 weeks post injury. However my sesamoid was soooo painful and sore and I could barely move my toe, I just knew I needed at least 6 weeks.
- yes I have slight muscle atrophy on the calf and yes my left foot is now (maybe) having some issues from overcompensating for 6 weeks  but I'm so glad I stuck with the boot until the pain settled. I always took it off when resting and only used it when moving around the house. It supported my foot, kept my foot immbolised and limited my steps. At the beginning I could barely wriggle my toe without a sharp shooting pain and I'm gradually getting a slight bit of movement back

I'm no where near recovered yet and still have a lot of work ahead of me in terms of learning to walk again and slowly building it back up (walking is how I injured it in the first place with improper footwear and pushing through pain)
But touch wood, I am on the road to recovery . And I know positive stories help üíì",2025-04-05 05:43:43+00:00,7,2
1jrw7oo,Hoka,Clifton 9 - good for me?,"Likely going to purchase these soon. Have done a lot of research, tried on a ton of different shoes from many brands and by far the most comfortable were the Clifton 9s. Hit all the sweet spots as soon as I put on the shoe. Also, the reviews seem to be great across the board. 

I‚Äôm a heel striker/midfoot striker ‚Äúblend‚Äù (I‚Äôm working on improving my gait to be more consistent) and am a regular runner. Am currently training for a Half in June and my current Mizunos (Wave Rider 27) are on their last leg so I wanna have time to break the new pair in before the race. 

Any other heel strikers out there who can vouch for these? With the price I really want to be sure. I know I could go back and exchange or warranty them if I wanted, but still.

The Nike Pegasus 41 are probably my 2nd choice atm. And then maybe the Asics Novablast 5.

I wasn‚Äôt impressed by the Waver Rider 28s, sadly. ",2025-04-05 05:22:27+00:00,1,5
1jruiiq,Alden,New to Alden,"I am new to Alden and looking for a pair of bluchers at the moment‚Ä¶maybe some boots down the road. I am sure folks ask sizing questions around here all the time, so I apologize up front. That said, I am new to Alden footwear and looking for advice from the experts. A little info: I am a Brannock 10E on my left foot and 10D on my right foot. Bit of a bunion situation from years of running, so my left foot is widest right at the ball of my foot. I really hate having anything constricting the width or pressing down on the ball of my left foot at all. That said, no flat arch or anything else to deal with, my feet are pretty typical aside from my wide left foot.

A few points of reference. I wear US size 11 in every sneaker I own: Nike, New Balance, HOKA, and Onitsuka. All of them are super comfy. I own a ten year old pair of Chukka boots from Cole Haan in a size 10.5 that fit super comfy, way more comfortable than any Goodyear welted boot I have tried. And I own two pairs of Viberg boots. One pair is in their ubiquitous 2030 last in a size 9.5EE - I find these pretty comfy. The other pair is in their supposedly roomier 1035 last in a size 10E - I find these slightly long, but also too narrow and constricting right at the ball of my wider left foot.

After doing my research I feel like I‚Äôm probably going to prefer the Trubalance last. And I think I want at least an E width. I know Viberg‚Äôs E width is more like a generous D. Is Alden‚Äôs E width a bit wider than Viberg‚Äôs? Or should I be looking at Alden‚Äôs EE? Also, should I be going down to a 9.5? Or should I stick with my Brannock 10 to get the roomier fit I prefer?

Next, my 9.5EE Viberg 2030‚Äôs have a lactae hevia sole, which adds some nice give under the foot. Whereas my 10E Viberg 1035‚Äôs have a Vibram 700 sole that is super rigid. Being 43 years old, I actually added a synthetic ‚Äúporon‚Äù cushioned footbed to the 1035‚Äôs and still find myself wishing for a bit more ‚Äúsquish‚Äù honestly. As a result, I am most interested in Alden‚Äôs wedge sole. Does that make sense? Is it pretty forgiving? Or is it pretty rigid? Is there a more forgiving sole option?

If you‚Äôve come this far, thank you for reading all this. So, what‚Äôs your recommendation for: last, size, and sole? Oh, and where should I be shopping? Looks like there are tons of great stockists, are there specific ones you love?",2025-04-05 03:39:12+00:00,2,10

I typically wear size 41 and I ordered a size up at 42 because of my wide ass feet, but I should have ordered 43. I have a feeling they will loosen up though so it's not the end of the world, they were extremely comfortable but my toes were a little cramped.

I ended the day without foot pain, with minimal back pain, and without ANY knee pain after a 9 hour shift, without having sat down at all. I felt the whole day like I was walking on a cloud and when I took them off, my socks weren't sweaty at all. 

I wish I would have ordered them sooner, tbh.

1jrkx2d,womensfashion,Black women‚Äôs athletic shoe that‚Äôs good for standing?,"

I‚Äôm starting a new job where I need to wear black shoes. 90% of the time in my life I wear my Nike Airs - I used to wear Converse but switched since I walk a lot as Nikes have more platform and are better for walking/standing. I‚Äôll be working on a boat so I also want them to be okay to get wet. 

I‚Äôm torn between a couple of different types. 

One option is Shoes for Crews Converse look-alikes (I think they‚Äôre called Pembroke). I like the look and that they‚Äôre slip/water resistant, but worry that they won‚Äôt be good for standing a lot.

I could also get all black platform Converse, which might be better for standing, but aren‚Äôt slip resistant or water proof. 

Or I could eschew the idea of getting a style I like and just going for something like All Bird wool running shoes which are waterproof and good for standing, or black Hokas, which I love and know I can walk in but can‚Äôt get wet. Problem with these is I think they‚Äôre kinda ugly.

I want to get a pair that I think I‚Äôll wear beyond just work since this is just a summer job, so I don‚Äôt really want to buy some I think don‚Äôt look good. Boots aren‚Äôt ideal because I‚Äôll be biking to work. What should I do? Any suggestions?

*  ‚Å§ **Breathability:** Breathable hiking boots‚Å§ are essential for preventing sweaty feet and‚Å¢ blisters, especially‚Äã in warmer weather. Mesh panels and breathable membranes can enhance airflow.

1jrjred,sesamoid,Ballroom dancer's experience with sesamoiditis,"First reddit post! I want to share my experience with sesamoiditis to see if anyone has gone through anything similar. There are a lot of stories about healing time for people waited too long before seeking  treatment for sesamoiditis. I sought help quite early, so I'm interested in hearing experiences where people caught it quickly and what the recovery time was like. Also, interested in hearing from dancers and if you have ever dealt with flare ups again since this is something that I am worried about.

For context, I am a competitive ballroom and latin dancer, who competes in the standard style. I typically train 4-5 times a week for \~2 hours at a time. I go to the gym 2-3x a week to do strength training and cardio. I also do mat pilates once a week. Here is my story.

Early January 2025 - Came back from about a 2 week break from dance for the holidays. I slowly ramped up practice, as I was coming back from a break. One week I noticed that my big toe felt slightly weird while walking around at work. I didn't think much of it. It kind of disappeared throughout the day. The next day I woke up with no pain. As I walked around at work the weird feeling in my big toe came back. It wasn't even necessarily pain - it was more of a weird almost tingling feeling. I figured I must have just irritated my toe slightly. I went to dance practice and practiced quickstep, which involves a lot of jumping and hopping. (The worst dance I could have done!!) I noticed that throughout the practice the pain spread from my big toe to the ball of my foot. By the end of practice, I was in a lot of pain. I woke up the next day and I was in so much pain. I could barely walk or place any weight on my foot. I immediately booked an appointment with a podiatrist for a couple of days after.The podiatrist told me to wear a dancer pad during practice, try PT, and come back if the pain got worse. Obviously, I could tell his advice to keep dancing was very bad advice! I decided to stop dancing in the meantime while I waited to get an appointment with a PT. The podiatrist took an Xray and confirmed there was no fracture.

Mid-late January 2025 - I finally met with a PT. PT advised that I needed to stop dancing until I was close to being pain free. She suggested I wear Hoka bondi as my everyday shoe and gave me PT exercises to do at home. She also suggested I up my mat pilates from once a week to twice a week in the meantime so I would be able to keep up my cardio. Mat pilates has been great way to stay fit. I just modify any exercise that requires putting weight in the ball of my foot e.g. planking on knees instead of feet. She also told me to keep using a bike in the gym to maintain cardio.

Late January - late February - With time my foot started to feel better. It would get aggravated if I walked/stand too much (I live in a city, so walk around a lot!) However, for the most part it was moving in the right direction. A lot of times when I got pain in my foot - it would start in my big toe then spread to the ball of my foot. My PT quickly identified that my sesamoiditis gets triggered when my big toe gets aggravated in some way. She also believes the condition first started due to my big toe getting aggravated, which led to a reaction in the sesamoids. Pretty early on, I also bought the Hoka Ora recovery slides to wear at home. I did not wear the dancer pads much, because I didn't feel the need to wear them. I continued cycling and going to mat pilates. With every week, we increased the reps or modified the PT exercises that I was doing to ensure my foot kept on getting stronger.

End of February - I was cleared to start dancing once a week for max 1 hour since my pain had significantly cleared up to the point where I was walking around and going about my day pain free.

March 2 2025 - first solo dance practice. My first dance practice was fine. I felt little twinges of pain in my foot occasionally, but I did not have any significant pain in my foot the next day, which was a good sign.

March 6 2025 - first practice with my dance partner. My foot was very mad at me after this practice. It hurt in like 3 different places, and was sore for multiple days after this dance practice.

March 13 2025 - 2nd solo dance practice - My pain had mostly subsided from the last dance practice. Again I felt twinges of pain in my foot occasionally during the hour. I had minimal pain the next day.

March 23 2025 - my first dance practice with my partner where i felt no pain in my foot for the entirety of the dance practice. I felt 0 pain the next day too. My PT cleared me to start dancing up to twice a week.

March 31 2025 - Unfortunately, I had yet to dance again since March 23 2025 due to external factors. My foot had been feeling pain free and very mobile since the 23rd. During the day, I had to bend down to look for something. I bent down in a squat all the way with knees over my toes. I should've gone on my hands and knees, but i didn't think it would be an issue for 5 minutes! After being in that position for a little bit, I started to feel the soreness and pain creeping back into my big toe.

April 2-3 2025 - Big toe and ball of the foot have been causing trouble again. It felt sore and the big toe mobility was  stiff again. I had the worst pain that I have had in a while. Granted, it was still not as bad as when I was initially diagnosed.

April 4 2025 - my big toe is feeling quite sore and painful still. I am really hoping I haven't set myself back seriously.

I will keep updating this story as it progresses. Hopefully, I can make a full recovery in the next couple of months and start competing soon! I'm interested to hear from people who have had similar stories! Milder cases of sesamoiditis - strictly inflammation, no fractures. I'm also interested to hear from dancers.

I  am worried about getting back to competing. The shoes we have to wear have a very narrow toe box. I am scared that competition shoes will aggravate my big toe, and trigger the sesamoiditis again. Also ballroom dancers spend a lot of time on the ball of the foot in general, so I am worried about triggering the sesamoiditis that way, but I am trying to stay positive! Also, curious to hear what you guys think triggered your sesamoiditis? It is such a mystery to me, but the only thing I can think of for myself is that I started jumping rope in the two week break. That is the only thing in my life that changed during that period. Sesamoiditis is such a pesky thing. It's so annoying how it just starts so gradually and comes out of nowehere!

Would also love to hear if there are any random things that you are doing to give yourself peace of mind in terms of the healing process? I know there's ice, contrast baths, toe separators etc. etc. However, I would like to hear about the more ""off the beaten path"" remedies you are trying.  I will share a list of what I'm doing. None of these have strong scientific backing, but they give me a peace of mind!

\- started drinking cranberry juice (reduce inflammation?)

\- started wearing compression socks (promote blood circulation?)

1jrgnj2,Shoes,Black women‚Äôs athletic shoe that‚Äôs good for standing?,"
I‚Äôm starting a new job where I need to wear black shoes. 90% of the time in my life I wear my Nike Airs - I used to wear Converse but switched since I walk a lot as Nikes have more platform and are better for walking/standing. I‚Äôll be working on a boat so I also want them to be okay to get wet. 

I‚Äôm torn between a couple of different types. 

One option is Shoes for Crews Converse look-alikes (I think they‚Äôre called Pembroke). I like the look and that they‚Äôre slip/water resistant, but worry that they won‚Äôt be good for standing a lot.

I could also get all black platform Converse, which might be better for standing, but aren‚Äôt slip resistant or water proof. 

Or I could eschew the idea of getting a style I like and just going for something like All Bird wool running shoes which are waterproof and good for standing, or black Hokas, which I love and know I can walk in but can‚Äôt get wet. Problem with these is I think they‚Äôre kinda ugly.

I want to get a pair that I think I‚Äôll wear beyond just work since this is just a summer job, so I don‚Äôt really want to buy some I think don‚Äôt look good. Boots aren‚Äôt ideal because I‚Äôll be biking to work. What should I do? Any suggestions?

My fianc√© had recommended hoka and I ended up seeing a shoe I really liked on the Hoka website (for myself), but held off from buying them until after the holidays.

They were very unique, and almost futuristic design. The base color was a cream/eggnog and there was like this silicone/plastic-y/shiny black outer layer. Almost like an exoskeleton üòÖ

When I came back to the website after the holidays, they were gone and I've not been able to find them no matter how much I've searched (at this point I just want to know the name). If my fianc√© didn't distinctly remember them too, I would just write it off as a dream. 

Does anyone have any ideas of what this hoka might have been? I feel like I'm losing my mind lol

1jrau1f,ValueInvesting,Deckers Outdoor Corporation (DECK): A Value Opportunity in the Footwear Industry,"Hey r/ValueInvesting, I‚Äôve been digging into Deckers Outdoor Corporation (DECK) lately, and I think it‚Äôs a compelling opportunity worth sharing. It all started with a personal win: I‚Äôve struggled to find shoes that let me walk for hours without pain‚Äîuntil I tried Hoka‚Äôs Clifton. It‚Äôs like walking on clouds, and lately, I‚Äôve noticed Hoka shoes everywhere. Turns out, I‚Äôm not the only one hooked, and the numbers behind Deckers, the company powering Hoka, UGG, and more, back up why this might be a hidden gem trading at a discount.

For the deep dive, check out my full newsletter: [https://substack.com/@onthestreetwithlouis/note/p-160155680?utm\_source=notes-share-action&r=4af6n2](https://substack.com/@onthestreetwithlouis/note/p-160155680?utm_source=notes-share-action&r=4af6n2)

# Growth That Grabs Attention

Deckers is firing on all cylinders:

* **Sales Surge**: In 2024, net sales jumped 18.2% year-over-year, with a 5-year CAGR of 18%. Domestic sales grew 16.8%, and international sales outpaced that at 21.1%.
* **Margin Expansion**: Gross profit margins climbed from 50.3% in 2023 to 55.6% in 2024, hitting 60.3% by Q3 2025. That‚Äôs a 15-point leap since 2016‚Äôs 45%.
* **Brand Power**: UGG (54% of revenue) grew 14.9%, while Hoka (42% of revenue) soared 29.3% in the first three quarters of 2025.

# DTC: The Secret Sauce

Deckers is nailing the shift to online shopping:

* **Direct-to-Consumer Growth**: DTC sales now make up over 55% of net sales in Q3 2025, up from 43% in 2024. UGG‚Äôs DTC channel grew 21.5%, and Hoka‚Äôs exploded by 39.7%.
* **Strategy Paying Off**: Their focus on e-commerce and owned retail stores is boosting margins and customer loyalty, reminiscent of Nike‚Äôs early playbook.

# Rock-Solid Financials

Here‚Äôs where Deckers shines for value investors:

* **No Debt**: Zero long-term debt (outside lease liabilities)‚Äîa rarity that screams financial flexibility.
* **Capital Efficiency**: Return on invested capital (ROIC) is 32.71%, crushing Nike‚Äôs 21.89% and On Holding‚Äôs 16.33%.
* **Cash Flow Machine**: A cash conversion cycle of 58.5 days beats Nike‚Äôs 95.3 days and On Holding‚Äôs 181.1 days, showing top-tier operational efficiency.
* **Profitability Edge**: Net income margin hit 25% last quarter, leaving competitors in the dust.

# The Market‚Äôs Misstep

Despite this strength, Deckers‚Äô stock is down over 50% YTD (more than at the time of writing the newsletter). I ran the numbers through a proprietary DCF model, factoring in their guidance and historical trends, and pegged the fair value at $124 per share. With the market spooked by tariff talks and softening consumer confidence (Conference Board‚Äôs index just tanked to 92.9), it feels like Deckers is being extraordinarily punished, partly due to tariffs against China and Vietnam - two of Deckers' main manufacturing hubs. I feel Hoka's brand and product differentiation will allow them to weather this storm in the long-term.

# Why I‚Äôm Bullish

Deckers echoes Nike‚Äôs early days‚Äîinnovative products, a loyal following, and a knack for execution. Their brands are resilient, their balance sheet is fortress-like, and their DTC push positions them to thrive as shopping habits evolve. Even with macro headwinds, I see a business built to last, trading at a price that‚Äôs more than fair.

What do you all think‚Äîam I onto something with Deckers, or is the market‚Äôs discount justified? Let‚Äôs discuss!",2025-04-04 12:37:23+00:00,1,10
1jra8bh,investing,NIKE And The Elephant In The Room,"This isn‚Äôt advice for anyone, just writing down my reasoning.

I started building a small position in NKE in mid February, with an average price of $70. The position I currently hold represents 1/4 of the total exposure I‚Äôm willing to allocate to a single stock.

***Why I Chose Nike***

What led me to invest in NKE is my belief that its competitive moat remains strong.

The previous CEO attempted to boost revenues by shifting to a direct-to-consumer model (D.T.C.) , cutting ties with resellers like Foot Locker and AW Lab to prioritize online sales. However, this strategy had mixed results. Nike ended up selling less and discounting more, while resellers, hurt by the shift, started focusing on alternative brands. This weakened Nike‚Äôs position, but in my view, the decline wasn‚Äôt solely due to the CEO‚Äôs strategy.

As a non-durable goods business, Nike is highly sensitive to shifts in consumer demand. The global economy has been leaning toward reduced discretionary spending, with consumers cutting back on non-essential purchases.

Nike has a unique positioning: it doesn‚Äôt aim to be a luxury brand with extreme markups, nor does it chase affordability like budget brands. Instead, its goal is to be aspirational‚Äîsomething that anyone, regardless of background, can desire and afford if they prioritize it. A kid from a rough neighborhood can dream of a fresh pair of Nikes, just as a white-collar professional can wear them with a suit to work.

Nike has always invested heavily in brand perception, pouring money into athletes and sports teams to maintain cultural relevance.

***Why Nike Struggled & Why I Bought In***

Nike‚Äôs recent decline can be attributed to three key factors:

1. The previous CEO‚Äôs shift to direct-to-consumer, which hurt relationships with resellers.
2. Fierce competition from brands like Adidas and Hoka.
3. A weaker consumer willing to spend less on discretionary goods.

When buying NKE, I understood that as a global non-durable goods company selling aspirational products, Nike would be among the first to feel the impact of reduced spending. Sneakers are not a necessity‚Äîmost people buy a fresh pair when they feel like it and when they have extra cash.

So what happens when inflation eats into disposable income? You start cutting back on non-essentials. That $130 pair of Nikes you wanted? If money gets tight, do you go barefoot? No‚Äîyou settle for a $90 pair of Hokas that are 30% off.

***Quality Decline & Consumer Sentiment***

I‚Äôm not blind or biased‚ÄîI own and have owned Nike shoes. It‚Äôs obvious to me, and to many other consumers, that quality has declined.

Earlier, I said Nike doesn‚Äôt care about margins, but I didn‚Äôt mean they refuse to adjust quality for profitability. Nike has always marketed its shoes as ""tech-driven,"" using innovative materials that once set them apart. While competitors were making leather running shoes, Nike used lightweight plastic-based materials that made their products cheaper to produce and more comfortable.

But today, cost-cutting measures are evident, and consumer trust has eroded. A lower-quality product, combined with increasing competition and a weaker consumer, is a recipe for short-term struggles.

***The Elephant in the Room: Tariffs***

Nike‚Äôs reliance on offshoring‚Äîparticularly in Vietnam, where it employs nearly half a million workers‚Äîhas now introduced a major risk. Recent tariff discussions have raised concerns that Nike may need to increase prices by around 8% to offset costs.

***My Investment Thesis***

I plan to keep averaging down as the stock falls. Consumer spending is weak, and markets are pricing in a potential recession. It‚Äôs reasonable to assume that non-durable goods like Nike will be among the first to take a hit.

I just added another quarter of my allocated exposure to NKE. I believe Nike‚Äôs ability to navigate supply chain disruptions, as demonstrated during the COVID era, will help it retain its position as a market leader.

That said, I‚Äôm fully aware that I could be providing liquidity for someone else‚Äôs exit. That‚Äôs how the market works‚Äîno one has the absolute truth.

I‚Äôm buying because I see Nike‚Äôs momentum in emerging markets. When a kid in a developing country wears a knockoff swoosh on their shirt, I see a future consumer who, if given the means, will choose Nike over other brands. The same dynamic played out in China, and I believe it will repeat elsewhere.

I hope this rambling gets read, and I welcome any opinions. I love being wrong because that‚Äôs how I learn.

As of now, I have no other exposure to US markets aside from NKE since early March. I‚Äôm sitting on bonds and liquidity, which could introduce bias into my perspective. My goal is to put that cash to work.",2025-04-04 12:06:03+00:00,2,28

1jr8qky,hikinggear,Help me finalise my hiking shoe selection!,"
Ok so I‚Äôve whittled down my hiking shoe shortlist but need a bit of help to finalise my choice.

Until now I‚Äôve been wearing salomon boots and Hoka anacapa goretex shoes (though they were tight and the fabric didn‚Äôt last) and prior to that salomon x ultra shoes. I‚Äôve tried and ruled out salomon xa pro 3D and the ultra 360. Just not getting quality vibes and the 3D sole is v thin. 

Criteria: relatively light, non goretex, good support/stability for my feet/ankles (I have custom insoles for this too and get occasional heel pain), and wearable for multi-day hikes carrying around 7-8kg. Got to have space for my wide mid and fore foot and high instep. 

Hoka anacapa breeze - I have an old pair of anacapa 2 goretex which were too tight really but now after over a year of wear are my comfiest shoe and I remember loving the feeling of being bouncier and sort of propelled in these. They are a tad narrow which is my main concern and I am not sure how supportive they are - lots of cushioning but no ‚Äòadvanced chassis‚Äô or technical elements I can see that are for support (eg merrell has a hard mid sole presumably for support?) the sole flexes as much as the merrrell when I try to fold it. (¬£105)

Altra Olympus 6 - these are the ones I want to work as I really like the design and the wide toe box which for the first time in my life give my toes room to spread naturally (must be what it feels like to have narrow feet in normal shoes!). the very straight outer side of the mid foot isn‚Äôt ideal for me but the fabric is pretty soft so I guess this will stretch easily. heel cup seems shallow, I‚Äôve laced to keep heel in and it varies between different socks but I am a bit concerned, do not want blisters, and I am not sure how supportive this shoe is relative to the others? Sole is much less flexible when I ‚Äòfold‚Äô it does this suggest more support? Expensive risk if they aren‚Äôt right (¬£150)

Merrell Moab Speed 2 - I found these comfy out the box mainly cos of fabric. No heel slip. But I am wondering if their lightness is a downside - can they hold up support wise to several days with a 7kg pack? The sole is less cushioned than the altra and Hoka and it‚Äôs very supple when I ‚Äòfold‚Äô it but is this a factor in terms of stability and support when carrying weight? Sole is vibram but not megagrip and seems a little less durable under pressure. Least expensive of the bunch at ¬£93. 

So what do you think? Is the outer sole / cushioning a factor when carrying a pack? Or is it just wear that‚Äôs impacted rather than support / comfort? Should my decision now ignore the support and come down to literally how it feels on my foot (which for me is always about width)?

Even with a heel strap I feel like it would just be way too loose and wobbly. Any recommendations for decently affordable shoes that‚Äôll keep my feet from hurting?

1jqchuw,AskRunningShoeGeeks,What's a good replacement for Hoka Cielo X1 (version 1.0)?,"The Hoka Cielo X1 (1.0) was the best shoe ever created (for me). Super bouncy (like buh buh bouncy feel giddy every time I put it on haha), awesome fit, great for slower/training runs as well as pushing me fast on race day. Truly nothing like it. I tried out Alphaflys, Endorphins, Adios Pro, Superblasts, Mach X2, and others; none of them felt ""special"" and made me excited to run like the Cielo X1 did. Unfortunately, I can't find any in size 13, and the new version 2.0 have lost all the versatility that made the 1.0 so perfect. They've got awful stability, don't fit as well, and don't work as well when I'm slowing down a bit.

  
**What shoe is like the Cielo X1 1.0? What are you buying as a replacement now that they're not produced any longer?** This was pretty much the top shoe of 2024, and Hoka stopped making it after less than a year. Very frustrating. Some of their shoes they still produce are over 2.5 years old, yet they're cancelling a top seller like the Cielo X1 1.0 within 12 months...ugh",2025-04-03 07:50:50+00:00,4,13

1jqb3eq,RunningShoeGeeks,Saucony Endorphin Elite 2 - First run impressions,"Hi all,

I just returned from my first run with the Saucony Endorphin Elite 2. I feel a bit different about this shoe than a lot of the (paid) online reviews in a couple of ways. That's why I wanted to share my thoughts.

Some stats: 174cm, 70kg, higher cadence running style, reasonably fast (recent 10K PB of 38:XX).

Currently searching for my shoe for a fall marathon with a sub-3 as my goal. The only other supershoe I own is the HOKA Rocket X 2, which I love, but can't picture wearing for a full marathon.

Upper:

I tried my usual EU size 42 in the store but immediately felt the need to go up half a size as many others do. I bought the 42,5 and get a good lockdown in it even without lace lock. There is some wrinkling of the tongue, but it doesn't matter much. The upper feels nice and airy, good stuff so far.

Outsole:

The outsole got criticized by some online reviews. But in dry conditions, I found it to be pretty fucking great. The rubber is scarce, but very sticky.

I haven't tried it in wet conditions, which is supposed to be its weak spot. So the jury is still out here.

Midsole:

That's why you're all here for, right? And boy oh boy, is this shoe different... You all saw the videos and there's no way around it: This shoe is squishy as hell and that comes with upsides and downsides.

When walking in it, this is the most unstable shoe I have ever worn. And it's not particularly close. Walking in it creates some drunken boxing vibes and I'm a bit worried about my ankles. But this is a running shoe, so let's run in it.

My easy pace ranges from 05:15 - 05:30 per km (08:27 - 08:46 per mile). Even at this warmup pace, the shoe instantly feels a lot more stable then when standing or walking around.

After the warmup, I did 15 and 12 minutes of threshold (slightly above 4mins/km or 06:25 per mile) with 4 minutes of jogging in between. Needless to say that this shoe really came alive when turning it up.

The ride is like nothing I have ever tried. It feels absolutely wild. The shoe wants to keep you on your midfoot and forefoot and in general moves you forward really well.

I did some strides and was pleasantly surprised how smooth the transitions were. I though that accelerating and slowing down would create some wobbling, but that was not the case.

Cornering is a problem. You have to slow way down to feel in control. If you plan to use it on a more difficult course, you might wanna think again. Also, anything other than a well-kept road (e.g. cobblestones) would be a no-no for this shoe.

Here's my biggest gripe: I didn't seem to run efficiently. I hit my paces easily, but my HR was quite high at the end of the second rep. I usually prefer a rolling type of shoe due to my mechanics. I feel like all the bounce creates some unnecessary movement. This is 100% a personal thing, but I am sure there are other runners who feel the same.

So all in all, it's a fast shoe, it's a unique shoe. I am just not sure, if it's the right shoe for my fall marathon. Of course, this was only the first run. I will test it some more in the future.",2025-04-03 06:17:27+00:00,120,42

The pain gets significantly worst after 20+ 30+ and 40+ miles. It might just be that my shoes are pretty worn out though.

1jq4768,AskRunningShoeGeeks,"Any wide midfoot ""super"" shoes out there?","I'm 240 lb 5'9"" M, and I've been testing shoes to find some that fit me well.

But I'm having some issues with my left foot; it seems to be about an inch longer than my right foot, and a bit wider, as well. I'm between a D and 2E; so some wide D's fit, and most 2E fit. But the problem is that, while they fit, I have some pain on the left edge of my midfoot. Many shoes I test seem to either have some foam or tightness that hit the pressure on that edge; I don't know if I somehow hurt it, or if a shoe caused it; but I've had to give up on many shoes because the pain is so bad often I won't be able to walk with the shoes on.

My size seems to be 10.5.  
I tried the Puma MagMax Nitro at 10.5 but it hit the pressure point. I'm waiting for the MagMax Nitro on 11. The Superblast 2 on 11 is hitting the same point, even though there doesn't seem to be any foam right where the pain is. I'm hoping the 11.5 would be a bit wider but I'm not holding hope.

So I'm wondering if there are any similar shoes that would be wider.

Right now, shoes that work:  
1080 v13 11 wide  
Kayano 31 10.5 wide  
Novablast 5 10.5 wide  
Guide 18 11 regular

Shoes that don't work:  
More v4 10 regular - to tight everywhere  
Hurricane 10.5 wide - weird pain on ball of foot  
MagMax Nitro 10.5 regular - excruciating pain on the pressure point, specially when not running  
Superblast 2 11 regular - haven't tested in run, but painful - not as bad as MagMax Nitro

(extra shoes that didn't work):  
Hoka Bondi 8 10.5 - midfoot pain  
Hoka Clifton 9 10.5 - toes numb, weird disconnect between feet and ground  
Hoka Arahi 7 10.5 wide - not enough volume (I heard the Arahi 6 wide was better but couldn't find one in my size anywhere)  
Hoka Gaviota 10.5 wide - same midfoot pain, although otherwise spacious.

I'm waiting on MagMax Nitro 11 regular  
Endorphin Speed 4 11 regular

I'm planning on getting orthotics soon, in case that matters. I've been told I overpronate, although I don't feel it; I thought I supinated a little, tbh.

I was looking for something that would hold my weight for longer distances and a bit more fun than Kayano/1080 to pick up the pace a bit, as well. I don't know that ""super shoe"" was the correct term.

Any suggestions/advice would be greatly appreciated.

Would breaking in the shoe help?

Is this an injury that I haven't realized yet?

1jq27lo,runninglifestyle,What are your fav Summer Trail Running Shoes (hot weather)?,"What are your favorite running shoes for hot weather? I'm specifically interested in trail runners but would take road runner suggestions too. 

Background: 
Hi, I am a newbie runner. I started going on daily runs with my dog about a year ago and now I'm obsessed! I run about 4-5miles every day. Sometimes on the weekend I do 6-9mi, but I don't really plan on doing anymore than that. I'm dreading summer because I need my daily run but hate running in hot weather because my feet get so fing hot and uncomfortable. The rest of my body is fine in the heat. I obviously try to get out as early as possible but I'm busy and sleepy so sometimes I can't get out until like 9am when it's already like 80+ degrees. Also I don't like running at night because I am a small young girl and I run alone most of the time and I'm afraid of bears/cougars/serial killers. So please, I just want recommendations on how to make my feet less hot, not comments about how I should change my running schedule. 

The trails I run are very dry and rocky in the summer. I live in Durango Colorado and spend a good portion of the summer in Bend Oregon. Pretty similar terrain both dry and rocky and hot. I need shoes that won't slide on dry rocks/boulders. 

My running concerns/injuries:
-HOT. my feet get really hot
-BLISTERS. I get pinch blisters on my big toes, on the tips of my toes, and in between my toes. They hurt bad. Locking my laces has helped a lot. 
-SHIN SPLINTS & FRACTURES.  I've struggled with shin splints and compression fractures my whole life throughout cross country/track in school. I ended up quitting both sports because I get them so bad. I would sit out for like two weeks and they would get better but as soon as I would start running the would come right back. I haven't had them since I started running in the Mafate 4's (about 1yr ago) but idk if it is due to the shoe or due to me just having stronger muscles/bones now. 

My shoe history:
-HOKA MAFATE SPEED 4. 
  *Pros- These are the shoes I started running in a year ago. I LOVED these shoes for trail running and hiking all year in Colorado. They are super grippy on rocks/boulders. I felt confident that I wasn't going to slide going from rock to rock. I never got any shin splints with them.  
*Cons-Unfortunately they did cause some pinch blisters on my toes even with my laces locked. They were sooooo hot in the summer. 

 -NIKE Pegasus Trail 4 Gore-TEX. 
*Pros-These are the shoes I've been wearing all winter. I love these so much. No shin splints and no pinch blisters at all. This is actually the first shoes that I've ever worn that doesn't give me blisters. These shoes did great on the slippery icy trails and kept my feet warm and dry. 
*Cons-I have not experienced any cons with these for the winter. I'm sure since they are goretex they would be hot in the summer. 

-HOKA SPEEDGOAT 5. 
*Pros- none I hated them.
*Cons- I tried these last summer and I absolutely hated them. They felt clunky, unstable, and did not feel bouncy. I tried them on a 4mile trail run and then a 4mile hike and hated them so much for both so I returned them. Tgod for rei. Idk how these are so popular. 

-Adidas ultra boost: 
*Pros-these felt comfy for walking
*Cons-I ran in these occasionally a few years ago and got terrible shin splints and blisters. 



My Socks: 
*I honestly don't notice a difference between running socks and these regular hue socks when it comes to foot hotness. The feetures still making my feet really fing hot. 
-Feetures Elite Ultra Light Cushion Quarter
-Darn Tough Women's 1/4 Ultra-Lightweight Run Sock
-HUE Women's Mini Crew Sock 6 Pair Pack 

My specs if it matters:
-Age, 26yr
-Sex, female
-Height, 5ft
-Weight, 100lbs
-Body type, toothpick

But Mizuno's equivalent sizing goes: UK 8 / US 9 / EU 42. So if I went with the EU measurement I'd already be half a size down.

Also note that I do like shoes to be snug and I have slightly narrow and slightly low-volume feet.

1jpyqrg,selfaccountable,"Walking Log - April 1, 2025","Hello Fit People!

The weather is sort-of, finally improving out on the West Coast of Canada. Spring seems to be in the air, because I'm all stuffy and my eyes are constantly watering -- which usually means spring and allergy season.

As I mentioned on a previous post, I did buy a smart ring (budget, entry-level) and tried it out on my walk yesterday. Unfortunately it did not work -- it did not record the exercise event. I'm emailing for support and will update my review once I get an answer from them.

But I did measure with my GW7, and of course wore my Hoka's as well. Those shoes are so friggin comfortable! I honestly don't know how I managed walking as much as I did with my other shoes. Yes, they are expensive but so worth the money!

Here is how I did:

April 1, 2025

* Distance - 5.49km
* Total Time - 1:06
* Avg Speed 4.9 km/h
* Steps - 7,306
* Calories - 612 (but who knows)

I had gone out shopping earlier in the day so actually walked 13,588 steps for the entire day and according to the GW7 app, I burned 2,814 calories and walked a total of 9.85km.

As it had been a while since the last time I went out for a walk (terrible, terrible, terrible cold/flu/infection) I probably should have taken it a bit easier. Maybe I should have only done 3km but I thought I should push myself a little bit and did 5km instead.

Not gonna lie, my left foot was very sore after the walk due to my metatarsal injury. So I got home, did some feet exercises to alleviate the pain and soaked it in my foot spa.

I also started IF again yesterday, and completed 16:8 IF.

Breakfast was three omega three eggs (omelet with onions, and serrano peppers diced), two Persian cucumbers and one cup of tea with two teaspoons of evaporated milk. As a snack I had two small gala apples, (262 grams and 137 calories). So total (so far) has ben 374 calories. 32% of the meal was carbs (19g, but 8g fiber and 2g sugar) and 28% was protein (or 17g).

My goal is to drink 3l of water as well, unfortunately so far I haven't had any water this morning other than in my tea which was maybe 12oz..

Is it normal to have sore feet for a bit when trying out new shoes? I wore them for a 4 hour standing shift at work and my feet hurt, however my feet usually hurt when standing at work in my converse so maybe it‚Äôs impossible to eliminate all pain? I have only tried them once. When I tried hoka clifford‚Äôs I wore them for 5 shifts and was still sore so I returned them. How long should I try out the brooks before I give up? I also tried some new balances and still had sore feet, so maybe that is just my norm. I will try wearing them for a run today",2025-04-02 17:06:44+00:00,1,4

1jpoyyt,bunions,Walking shoes for my older Mother,"Good morning everyone!

My 66 year old Mom recently got a new dog, and she is walking her a TON. In the last year or so, she went from a sedentary desk job, to working in a plant nursery, to walking around 5 miles a day. I am incredibly proud of her.

Anyways, I want to get her a nice pair of shoes. She has Hallux Bunions (The inside ones, just to be sure) and wears a 7.5 Wide. I asked if the Wide is to accommodate the bunions or if she has wide feet regardless and she said she doesn't know because she's been wearing Wide for so long

She does most of her walking on pavement or packed dirt, but has some interested in light hiking/trail walking. I don't foresee her running any time soon so I'll focus on walking for now.

I'd like to utilize my military discount so I can get her something really nice so it'd be great is ASICS, New Balance, Adidas, Saucony, Mammut, or Reebok make something good, but it seems like Hoka and Brooks are some of the top shoes so if that's what she needs that's fine because she deserves it

**tl;dr** Ultimately if you all can recommend something for a 7.5 (Likely wide) women's shoe that is good for walking, with some light trail use, I'd really appreciate it! Thanks everyone",2025-04-02 13:47:56+00:00,2,3

Just wanted to shout out the Hoka Bondi SR for completely changing how I move through my day. I‚Äôm a mom of three and walk at least 10,000 steps daily between school runs, errands, and everyday parenting chaos.

Before I found this shoe, I was constantly dealing with back pain, and my right foot would literally give out after too much walking. I‚Äôd limp my way home more often than not, and honestly figured that was just something I had to live with.

But I got the Bondi SR two weeks ago and... WOW. I can now walk so much more without that awful pain in my back or foot. I even hit 15,000 steps recently and came home feeling fine. Not sore, not limping‚Äîjust fine. It completely blew my mind. I had no idea shoes could make that much of a difference.

Turns out I‚Äôd just been wearing the wrong shoes this whole time. And I never would‚Äôve tried Hoka if it weren‚Äôt for this subreddit and the YouTubers who reviewed them. So seriously, THANK YOU. ü•πüòçü©∑ This shoe hands-down saved my feet and back.",2025-04-02 12:26:04+00:00,9,0

1jpafdn,PlantarFasciitis,Plantar Fasciitis and slightly sprained ankle?,"I'm a 25 year old female and I'm pretty sure I've got PF. I've never had any kind of foot/ankle injury in the past. I work at a school during the week and then on the side I take wedding photos. This week on Thursday I felt my feet were quite sore on the soles. Then Friday I had an 8 hour wedding day on my feet all day (in sandals) and then another wedding on Saturday (in sandals again) by Saturday morning my feet were feeling sore but I just thought it was because of the day before and not having much rest so i popped an ibuprofen and off I went.

Then I woke up on Sunday and could barely walk üôÉ

I stayed home and hobbled around not knowing what was wrong, and ended up reading about PF online and in this forum. I had a Telehealth appt on Monday, the podiatrist said it's sounding like early signs of PF and to rest, get some Archies slides for the home and some Hoka's for outside. She also sent me a referral to get an xray and ultrasound and said that if the pain is the same by the end of the week, to get imaging done to rule out fractures/tears.

For the past few days both ankles have been quite swollen and I feel like now with my house slides it's made walking around the house from unbearbale to somewhat bearable for short walks to the toilet/kitchen. I've also noticed at the beginning of the week my calves, hamstrings, glutes etc were so tight (probably from the hobbling and slight change in walk on the wedding days where I was a little in pain) so I've worked on stretching my whole posterior chain to help with this.

I had just enough sick leave to take this whole week off, and the next 2 weeks are school holidays so I essentially have 3 paid weeks off to recover which I am so grateful for.

Over the past few days I have been stretching, wearing house slides, icing my ankle, taking epsom salt baths, wearing compression socks and trying to stay off it as much as possible.

I'm just wondering if the ankle/foot swelling is normal and the leg muscle tightness is normal with PF? Or have I somehow unknowingly sprained my ankle at the same time as getting PF?

I'm still in the early days, so any tips/ advice of things I could do/avoid in the acute stage to help my recovery would be greatly appreciated!",2025-04-01 23:39:32+00:00,2,2

**Disclaimer: THIS IS NOT THE IDEAL PLAN.  YOU SHOULD RUN FOR MORE MONTHS.**

Hey everyone, I have my first marathon coming up in early May.

While I do not consider myself a runner, I fiddled around in XC in Junior High/HS, I have previously(past 14 months) ran two half marathons with the following times:

2:11:00(feb 2024)

1:55:00(sep 2024)

This past Thanksgiving, I ran a 10k @ 48:20(7:47 avg).

[Clearly not a big runner besides races](https://preview.redd.it/lkist7ej5ase1.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=a33a398ba4bd4a030bc691ede1315394f05074ae)

[trying to imrpove mileage recently, more dedicated](https://preview.redd.it/gwfco3ll5ase1.png?width=1134&format=png&auto=webp&s=87261dd565ce42395dd02620203910b5b8e4bc1e)

I have, more or less, gritted my teeth through these runs(the half marathons).  They have in the past resulted in multiple days of prolonged soreness or debilitating issues that lingered for weeks(typically just shin splints).  Prior to these races, I do not really train and my weekly mileage would never exceed 10mpw for any prolonged period of time.

I've been trying to be better about this considering a marathon is obviously a considerable leap from a half marathon, and I do want to genuinely perform well(perhaps sub 4:00).  This has looked like the following:

https://preview.redd.it/wpkf9gd7y9se1.png?width=1158&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c9cac8e0768163a6a56f8a2e2e0b1495e313b69

Halfway through January I got serious about running and attempted to start steadily increasing weekly mileage 15% per week(I recognize this is above the 10% suggestion, but I got crunch time going on here).

This started at 8-10mpw(January 10th).  With running typically 1.5-2 miles per day with 5-6 days a week of running activities.  I would closely monitor pain or significant soreness closely and deload if necessary or push an extra rest day if I felt it unproductive to run that day.  The usual.

[started slow and low volume](https://preview.redd.it/ehswp3500ase1.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fe0b5aa52da78d14d2ac59452cd76de46750afc)

[increased volume](https://preview.redd.it/wyv5nsi18ase1.png?width=1134&format=png&auto=webp&s=32d31f1eef1dcdbb1bc3339d400c9d1fa6e0c5f2)

I have noticed improvements, but definitely believe I am still about 8 weeks behind in training(in an ideal world).

**Current Running Status**

Last 7 days I have ran 30 miles coming off a previous deload week where I ran 20 miles.

https://preview.redd.it/iq2sp7me3ase1.png?width=929&format=png&auto=webp&s=fddaddc7dab35b81662887d1f599a0eb36ff4c8c

Here's a display of my previous 4 weeks of running weekly totals, try and ignore the weirdness with this week March 30th as it started yesterday with my 11 mile run.

https://preview.redd.it/lvvuxv0n0ase1.png?width=1182&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ca8d3e17d831f54c663c632d7ca636866b99d4b

This week, I have 31 miles planned and hope to push to 35 the week of April 8th - April 14th.

My longest run this week was 11 miles, running at a 145 avg hr at 10:25/mi average.  Felt okay during the run, but my achilles are starting to get a bit fed up post run.  I can tell I am definitely pushing it here on improving my mileage and ability while teetering the line of injury.  I do as much as I can in terms of good nutrition(I count calories and weight dilligently), quality sleep, and strength training.  I have ran the past 4 months on Hoka Mach 6's with a 5mm toe drop.  I am switching to Sauccony's today with a 8mm toe drop to hopefully reduce the load on my achilles/calves further.  I do believe this is soreness, not tendonitis.  So I do believe I have avoided major injury thus far.

**Planning**

I want to go on a long run of at least 18 miles.  Hopefully an additional 14-16 mile run as well.

I am also obviously wanting to continue to increase running mileage but understand this is a critical part of the training where I need to NOT develop an injury prior to the start of the marathon.  Yes, if I had 12 weeks prior to the marathon rather than 4 and 3/4, that would be ideal.  However here we are and I am running this marathon.

**This gives me the following plan:**

April 1st - April 7th - 31 miles

April 8th - April 14th - 35 miles(?)

April 15th - April 21st - 40 miles(?)

April 22nd - 28th - 40 miles(?)

April 29th - May 3rd - 20 miles (deload?)

**Race day** \- May 4th - 26.2mi

I'd love to hear any input on this idea or past experiences of those who were in similar positions where they could muscle and grit their way through a run, but now things are getting serious quickly with a marathon impending.  I'd love to not HATE this marathon experience, but understand that it will be undoubtedly difficult.

Am I okay in only having 4 weeks of >30mpw?  Would you stress me to try and push harder in the next 3 weeks?  Do you think the opposite?  Obviously you are not in my body, but I do find myself capable of exceptional runs on 2 or even 3 days of a rest(who doesn't).  Should I deload more?  Is my chronic load probably needing to reduce further with more time?  Is pushing mileage at this point futile?

I look forward to any input on my plan or anecdotal experiences from those who have found themselves in similar situations.",2025-04-01 20:07:19+00:00,1,3
1jp3jnb,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Superblast 2 as a daily trainer?,"I'm looking for my next daily trainer. Given my weight and long-distance runs, I'm considering highly cushioned options like the Hoka Bondi 9, Nike Vomero 18, and Puma Magmax. 

However, my best long runs have been in the Asics Superblast 2, which is expensive but I can get it with a 20% discount. With that discount, its price gets close to the other shoes, which‚Äîexcept for the Vomero‚ÄîI find too expensive for what they offer.  

Previously, I only used the Superblast 2 for long runs. My other shoes are the Mach X2 and Skyward X, so the Superblast remains my only shoe without a plate. 
Does it make sense to ""wear out"" an extra pair just for regular 7-9 mile runs?",2025-04-01 18:53:06+00:00,102,77

1jp2ua5,Hoka,Disappointed in Arahi 7,"I‚Äôm not sure what happened between the 6 and the 7, but my husband purchased the 7‚Äôs about a month ago and they‚Äôve already been completely obliterated.

* [**Janji** Artist collection, in paisley](https://janji.com/collections/paisley) Janji is reincorporating artist‚Äôs work into their apparel which they did a lot in the early days. It‚Äôs a cool way to both support the arts and develop interesting patterns that feel uniquely Janji!

* Puma released a [commercial featuring Afroman‚Äôs ‚ÄúBecause I Got High‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaI7Ty0UeRk).

The tearaway tag here feels very Satisfy.
* **Hoka x Marni** shoe drops April 4th. Not a running shoe, but similar running silhouette. Noting this because it's their move into high fashion which I was briefly interviewed about in [Business of Fashion](https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessoffashion.com%2Farticles%2Fretail%2Fhoka-marni-fashion-collaboration-strategy%2F).

* Heard rumors of a **Nike** Pegasus 41 Mayfly. This appears to be a mockup, but the mayfly was originally a lightweight race shoe made to last only 100k. The upper was made of a super lightweight Tyvek like material and was discontinued around 2010.

1jou18c,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Vaporfly Next% 3....still worth it?,"For context, I'm a 45 year old man, 136 lbs. Started running not long after the pandemic hit. I'm currenly training for my 4th marathon, which is in 7 weeks. I'm having to scale back my expectations a bit. My original <3:20 goal time was really ambitious to begin with, and my training plan got seriously messed up thanks to a stubborn knee injury.

So I'll gladly settle for a PB that beats my current 3:25 time even by one minute. I have very limited super shoe experience:

Puma DNE2: use them for short track sessions, they're pretty firm, not great for a full marathon imo.

Hoka Rocket X: send them back after one run. They were a full size too large, and ehm...felt pretty dead. Bought them used, so even though they showed very little signs of wear, I'm not sure what they've been through.

Anyway, I know new shoes won't make up for lost mileage, but I could use ANY help I can get at the moment, even if it's just a mental boost in the form of some efficient race day shoes.

I don't have any good reasons to not run the marathon in my Adidas Evo SL, though the lack of stability is a bit of a concern. And I'm just assuming that the carbon plate and lower weight of the VF3 do offer some benefits, no?

I spotted a pair of VF3 at a decent discount, at a store where I have a coupon for a couple extra bucks.

I can't afford to just order a pair of Adios Pro 4's or Saucony super shoes, even the AP3 would cost me more than the VF3....

So...yay or nay? Narrow feet, cadence/midfoot runner. I have a slight pronantion issue which should be manageable during a race. I know durability is a concern with the VF3, but if I only use them for my (half) marathons....it'd take me 5 years to get them to 300 miles.",2025-04-01 12:11:45+00:00,11,18

1jordsw,trailrunning,Shoes fell apart....50miler Ultra in 5 days...what do I do?,"Okay. Bare with me. I am NOT an avid runner but I am a trained runner? Does that make sense? I am a mixed-sport athlete so running races is sporadic. My training is on par for the weekend. I typically have 1 pair trail and 1 pair road sitting around.

I have a pair of Altra Lone Peak 7s that have primarily been my go-to for trail races. I was running the other day and they started to collapse and separate in spots. I am pretty confident they will fall apart on this race.

I went to REI today and picked up the new Altra Lone Peak 9+. However, I am frantic with them not being broken in. I tried out the Olympus 6, but could easily tell my heels had significant movement with even with the added bumper in the heel. I run OC for road racing and tried the Oc Vista, with the mid section and toe box feeling tight...Hokas don't really feel that good on my feet.

I am running a non-rocky trail run in three 17 mile legs, (51.5) with about 2k elevation per leg (about 6k). I have NEVER blistered in my prior Altras, though the lacking cushion can be tricky beyond 20m. I worry that with brand new Altras (i won't be hitting trails up until the race) I will come up short and not finish. Blisters, stiffness, cramping, etc. I was pumped when I bought the shoes earlier today...but now at 2am, I am highly anxious. I bought the Altras because I am used to the model...though it has changed some.

Race is non refundable or defferable.

What do i do?

Ideas

A. Wear the new Altras and drop down to the 50k which is actually 34m.
B. Send it and hope for the best?
C. Try a different reputable shoe with more cushion to offset the lack of break in? 
D.

1joqzkc,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Budget Half-marathon training shoes,"Best shoes for Half-marathon training

**Tl;dr: Warsaw, Poland, student, 183cm 72kg, flat feet (possible overpronation), popular running shoes out of stock or unavailable for trying in store, need shoe recommendations - one or two shoes that'll be for any kind of running, but mostly long practice runs and eventually half marathon, maybe more.**

Hi everyone! I have a goal of running a half-marathon. I have no real issue running 11km, except that my shoes start feeling uncomfortable.

The current shoes I use are Reebok Floatride Energy 5 Adventure, trail runners (but I run on pavement mostly).

I never should've gotten these shoes, or should've returned them when my feet weren't comfy during my first run with them, but I hoped they'd get better (and they did, but not that much, and ultimately - not enough).

I am looking into all kinds of recommendations and comparisons from Runner's World and Reddit, and cannot decide. More specifically, this subreddit. I checked out the recommendations here, but the FAQ here recommends 2 shoes, last years if on budget, but I don't know what kind of two shoes? It mentions a daily trainer and a faster, tempo shoe, but which one of these do I then use to run the half-marathon? I'm a bit lost.

I've originally planned for Asics Novablast 5, but now Runner's world recommends Brooks Ghost 16, or Hoka Mach 6 as best for men.¬≤¬≤3

I know that I should just try them on and see which one works best. But, the supplies are scarce and I can barely find any of these shoes online (I'm in Warsaw, Poland), let alone hope for a stationary shop to have them available. 

And while I could order some of these and return them if I don't like them, it doesn't seem productive to spend a couple hundred euro on shoes to try out and then wait for a refund, and I'm kind of on a budget because I'm still a student. 

Some, though, like the Novablast 5, I can only get used on a third party website (there's even only one listing matching my size, and the person isn't even responding to my messages), so trying and returning is not an option :(

I am 183cm, 72kg. I can't even get my foot analyzed anywhere for free (as far as I know) so I can only guess what my gait is. It's even possible that I lean into overpronation because I had flat feet as a kid (and a few years ago I was in a Decathlon store in Slovenia and they had a machine which told me my feet are flat).

I have no specific shoe line that I like and I need help and recommendations. I'm even considering getting a Decathlon-made shoe, such as their Kiprun brand, but what do you think?

I need some help. Thanks!",2025-04-01 08:53:49+00:00,2,10

I've spent a few hours looking up and reading about different shoes, and as much as I enjoy it, every time I think I found a pair I'm interested in, I see comments mentioning things like heel slippage, durability issues, etc. It's a spiral I can't seem to find the exit out of.

Some info:
- I tried on the Adidas Terrex Agravic Speed, but the toebox was too narrow.
- An all terrain sole will probably work best (I'm situated in Cape Town, South Africa... lots of rocky terrain, field and trails).
- I enjoy speedy shoes, but also want it to be suitable for easier runs (both short and long).
- Durability is important as I want it to last long.
- Not sure how I feel about a plate or too much cushioning as I want the shoe to feel snappy and versatile on the trails.

I've looked at the Saucony Peregrine 14 & 15, Asics Gel-Trabuco 15, Nike Zegama 2 Trail & the Mizuno Daichi. Any of these I should consider or stay away from? Perhaps something else completely like a Hoka?

Any advice and recommendations will be highly appreciated. I struggle to make a decision, but if I can be pointed in a direction and go for it trusting my gut (and strangers on the internet) that would be great!

Thanks in advance.",2025-03-31 21:15:43+00:00,2,11

1jobqxj,hiking,Hiking Shoes For Beginner?,"Hi everyone!

I'm going to be on a 5 day-day hiking trip soon in June, the highest altitude of the route is around 4500m. I exercises regularly but I'm not a regularly hiker. I have some issues with my ankle, so I'm looking for shoes with decent ankle support if possible. I own many tennies shoes, but they are not waterproof (the route will need us to cross rivers and the weather there is very humid) and they weren't built for hiking as they often lacked grip to the ground. 

I'm very thankful for any recommendation and I will look into each of them!

(I did ask ChatGPT about recommendation but I got confused ngl, here's the recommendation it made:

2. Salomon Quest 4 GTX

1jo7ww9,sesamoid,Struggling with sesamoid injury since 2023 ‚Äì Nothing helps. Surgery next?,"Hi everyone,
I was diagnosed with sesamoiditis at the beginning of 2024, but the injury actually started back in August 2023. I misstepped off a surfboard and injured my foot, but it took a while to get the right diagnosis.

My first MRI in December 2023 showed no sign of a fracture, just sesamoiditis. After a few rounds of shockwave therapy, my orthopedist sent me for another MRI in January 2024, but unfortunately, the results showed no improvement.

By October 2024, the condition had progressed into a transverse fracture of the lateral sesamoid bone.

Since then, I‚Äôve had multiple rounds of shockwave therapy (ESWT), PRP-treatment (ACP ‚Äì autologous conditioned plasma) with hyaluronic acid, and cortisone injections ‚Äì but nothing has really helped.
I‚Äôve also done many hours of physiotherapy, had several osteopath sessions, and have been wearing orthopedic insoles and Hoka Bondi 8s since early last year.

Has anyone experienced something similar? I have a surgical consultation here in Germany in two weeks and would really appreciate hearing about your experience or any advice. ",2025-03-31 16:52:37+00:00,7,11

I‚Äôm a 26-year-old athlete with a solid background in running, including completing multiple Ironman events. While I‚Äôve achieved some impressive results in my training and races, I‚Äôve encountered a persistent issue that I can't seem to overcome: blisters under my feet.

I've experimented with a variety of high-quality anti-blister socks, applied baby powder for moisture absorption, and tried numerous shoe brands (Hokas, Adidas, Nikes, both carbon-plated and non-carbon). Despite these efforts, I consistently find myself sidelined for 4-5 days after a good run due to blister-related discomfort.

I recently completed a strong run, achieving great results on my watch, but my feet are once again suffering. I have photos documenting the areas of rubbing, and I‚Äôm open to sharing them via direct message if anyone is interested.

I‚Äôm reaching out to this knowledgeable community for insights or strategies that might help alleviate this issue. Your advice could make a significant difference in my training and overall running experience. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated!

## Key Features to Consider When Choosing Women's Hiking Boots

When‚Å§ selecting your perfect pair of **women's waterproof‚Å£ light hiking boots**,consider these essential factors:

Other waterproof membrane‚Å§ brands ‚Å¢are available, but consider ‚Äåthe warranty to confirm quality and reliability.
*   **Weight:** Opt for boots that ‚Äçare genuinely lightweight.Check‚Äã the‚Äã manufacturer's stated weight‚Äã per boot ‚Å§(usually listed in ounces or grams).
*   **Outsole:** The outsole provides traction and stability. Vibram outsoles are a popular‚Å£ choice known for their durability and grip. Consider the lug pattern; deeper lugs offer better grip on loose terrain, while shallower lugs are suitable for smoother trails.
*   **Midsole:** The ‚Äãmidsole provides‚Äå cushioning and support. EVA midsoles ‚Äåare‚Å¢ lightweight and affordable,‚Äå while polyurethane (PU) midsoles offer greater ‚Å§durability‚Äå and support.Check for shock absorption.

Many search ‚Äåfor ‚Å£**women's hiking‚Äç boots ankle ‚Å£support waterproof** to achieve high stability.
*   **Fit and Comfort:** This ‚Å§is arguably the most critically important factor. Make sure the boots fit comfortably from‚Äç the moment you try them on.Pay attention to pressure points and ensure you have enough room ‚Å¢in the‚Å£ toe‚Å¢ box. ‚ÄãIf you have foot issues like‚Å£ plantar ‚Äçfasciitis, ensure you look‚Å£ for **waterproof ‚Äãhiking boots women arch support.**
*   **Breathability:** Even with ‚Å£a waterproof membrane, breathability is ‚Å£crucial to prevent your feet from getting sweaty ‚Äãand uncomfortable.Look for boots with breathable linings and uppers. Consider **lightweight hiking boots women‚Å§ breathable** in warmer climates.
*   **Durability:** Invest in boots made from high-quality‚Äç materials that can withstand the rigors of hiking.*   **Price:** **Expensive lightweight waterproof women's‚Äç hiking boots** may offer advanced features and superior durability, but there are also excellent **affordable lightweight waterproof women's hiking boots** available.

1jnzhu0,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Most comfortable cushioned daily trainer for a heavier (88kg/194lbs) runner?,"As the title says, I'm looking for a cushioned, ultra comfortable running shoe primarily for easy/recovery runs as well as long runs. Something that would keep my feet from fatiguing and that would just give the maximum amount of comfort possible.

My current shoe is NB 1080v13 which I have used for everything from speed workouts/interval training to easy and long runs. I even ran my first half marathon with them. I feel like they're starting to approach the end of their life.

I have now bought a pair of Adizero Evo SL's which I'm intending to use quite a lot, but perhaps with a focus on faster workouts. I would like to buy another pair for my rotation which I would primarily use for easy/recovery runs and long runs.

For context, I am a heel striker who's experienced some minor knee pain in the past which I have worked on with a physiotherapist. It has helped a lot, but I'm wondering whether a new shoe might also help mitigate any possible knee pain/discomfort in the future. I'm just guessing here, but perhaps the instability/lack of support of the 1080v13 might play a part there?

Shoes I have been considering based on a bit of research:

\-Asics Gel Nimbus 26/27

\-Asics Novablast 5

\-Hoka Bondi 9

I've just recently transitioned out of the moonboot into hokas with carbon plates . Getting orthotics measured later this week.

1jntxh3,FootFunction,Can metatarsalgia lead to knee and hip pain?,"A few weeks ago, I started to develop a pain in the ball of my foot behind the 2nd/3rd toe in just my right foot.  After doing some research, I came to the conclusion that it's probably metatarsalgia.  

Looking at treatment options, I realized first stop was to get some decent insoles.  So, I went to the local running store and purchased a pair of Currex insoles, which I put into my asics.  The employee who fitted me also suggested I might consider some other shoes for better support, and fitted me for the Hoka Gaviota and the Altra Escalante.    I ordered both, as the insole wasn't giving me enough relief.

I started wearing the Hokas and they were a huge relief.  I've just finished wearing them for 2 weeks, and while the metatarsalgia has not gone away, I can stand in the shoes comfortably.  Unfortunately, in the last three or four days, I noticed my right knee has been feeling weird and almost locking up at times.  Yesterday, it became more pronounced, and today it's been giving me alot of trouble to bend, as well as feeling sore in the hip on the same side.

I'm wondering if this is all related and should I be seeing a podiatrist or an orthopedic doctor?

Additional background:  I'm a 62 year old male, and have had desk/sitting jobs for my whole career.  In November, I started a new career as a pilates instructor, where I work 4 hour shifts about 6 times per week.  For the entirety of those shifts, I am on my feet walking up and down the studio, assisting clients with their pilates classes.  I've obviously never stood for this amount of time on a daily basis, so I figure my body is freaking out.  I was originally wearing adidas NMD's but they provided zero support and I couldn't get thru a single shift without back pain.  That's when I transitioned to the asics, and all was fine until the pain under my foot started to act up a few weeks ago.",2025-03-31 03:15:36+00:00,2,1

I current run with Hoka Mach 6 with an CURREX insoles and it's been serving me well. Got the insoles because of runner's knee and my PT at the time suggested it would help. He also suggested getting stability shoes, but we decided the insoles are a good first step. I have been diligent with my strength training and I think my knee is getting better. 

Can Evo SL work for with runners with moderate need of stability? I know at the end I would have to try it to know, but wonder if anyone here with similar issues has the experience doing so. I am running my first half marathon in 1.5 months and I am considering getting either another pair of Mach 6, rebel v4 or give the Evo SL a try. Appreciate any inputs!

1jnlt4x,Sneakers,Pureboosts vs Gel-Cumulus 26 (vs 26 GTX?),"Hi everybody,

my current shoes I use for both running and whatever other errand requires me to go outside (i.e. any activity that I don't dress up better for) are absolutely falling apart and starting to hurt my feet, which is why I'm looking to replace them. However, I find it incredibly difficult to choose what to buy given just how many brands exist, and within the brands just how many models...

I wore a pair of Ultraboosts from 2020 until now and really liked them - they were extremely comfortable. However, I'm trying to save a bit at the moment and can't find good sales on those and don't feel like shelling out 180 bucks, and I also don't care about brand and design etc anymore like I did a couple years back, so give me rainbow or poop colored shoes for all I care as long as they support my feet well, are good for running, and don't cost too much. (On the topic of color, why *do* so many models from basically all brands have such horrible color palettes? What's with all the neon and many different colors on one shoe? I don't care right now, but if I did shop based on design I feel like 90% of those could go straight to the bin)

I went to a store and tried on Hoka Clifton 9's, Asics Gel-Cumulus 26's, and NB M880A14s. They had a camera in the store to apparently judge how well the shoe supports your foot, and the conclusion seemed to be that the Gel-Cumulus 26's were the best. (They didn't have time to make me try on more pairs)

However, I also just found Pureboosts on a great sale online, and since I really liked my ultraboosts I'm wondering how they compare, not just to my ultraboosts, but also to the Gel-Cumulus 26s that I tried on. Is there a rule of thumb here? (Also, what's the difference between the Cumulus26 and Cumulus26 GTX?)

Thanks!",2025-03-30 20:29:57+00:00,1,0

1jnj5oa,trailrunning,Shoe Suggestions - Squashed Toes issue,"Hey all,

I've been running in Hoka Mafate Speed 4 shoes for 2 years or so now, and while I've always had a slight issue with my little toe being a bit ""crushed"", it's never really caused me any pain or problems. The odd blister after a long day, but nothing that really caused concern.

After a winter off, I've been having far more issues with it recently, especially after some back to back days, with the 2nd day seeing my 4th and 5th toes visibility squashed after some trail half marathons.

What are my alternative options? I'm very tempted by the Altra Lone Peak 9+, but switching to 0 drop 2.5months before my 1st trail marathon (with substantial elevation) feels like asking for trouble.

Topo is the other brand I've heard get recommended, but I don't really understand their offering right now. Any help understanding an equivalent to the mafate would be really helpful.

Being slightly overweight, I was never a speedster before, more like leisure running to be healthy. Back then I remember losing about 10kg from 105kg to 95kg. I ran on average 5-8k per day. Completed a couple of HMs and trail runs.

Wore Hokas and although they still feel good, I get the sense they might come apart any time soon. 

So I‚Äôm looking to get a pair of running shoes, looked around and currently considering Asics NB 5, 1080v13, SC Trainer V3‚Ä¶ What would you suggest? Thanks.

I have the sports flex slide, but I‚Äôm sure their other slides will work just as well with their proprietary foam. It‚Äôs by far the most comfortable slide I‚Äôve ever worn. (I‚Äôve also tried Nike Rejuven8 and Yeezy slides. HOKA Clifton‚Äôs seem to be better than the HOKA Bondis. )

I‚Äôve also tried many different things including golf ball, foot roller, slant board, TENS, night splint, ice roller and Dr. Schools insoles for PF.  None really seem to provide the same relief

1jn44dm,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Asics Kayano 14 vs Gel 1130 first try,"Many were praising the Gel 1130 over the Kayano 14 for ""comfort"" and ""cushioning"". So I had to purchase both to try for myself. (Silver/black is Kayano 14 and Grey/silver is 1130)

And I can tell you first hand that the Kayano 14 feels way more comfortable with more ""cushioning"" both in terms of the shoe base comfort and the impact absorption. You can feel it when walking around. The gel 1130 doesn't provide the same impact absorption.

Also, the inside footprint of the gel-1130 is smaller due to the smaller insole as seen in pics. (I'm guessing for cost reduction). So overall, another thing that makes it less comfortable for me.

I have no idea why so many kept saying gel 1130 has more cushion, because it doesn't seem that way for me. But anyways that's my observation. I'll be returning the gel 1130 and keeping K14

Is there anything better than Kayano 14 for walking, regardless of brand? I've heard of Nimbus 26 and Hoka but that's for running and I think too much foam is good for running but not great for walking, correct? ",2025-03-30 03:49:43+00:00,0,7
1jmwvxp,Hoka,Hoka Clifton 9 Sizing Experience ‚Äî Wearing 9 vs 9.5 After a Year of Use,"
I've been wearing my **Hoka Clifton 9s (size 9.5)** for about a year now. 

They've been my go-to for almost everything ‚Äî mostly gym sessions, but also runs (anywhere from 3 to 5 miles) and a lot of daily walking. 

I aim for about **10,000 steps per day**, and anytime I‚Äôm going on a longer walk, I usually grab these.

At this point, they‚Äôre **completely broken in** and feel extremely comfortable. 

I love Hoka for the support ‚Äî I have **very high arches**, which is the opposite of most people's issue with flat feet. 

I usually wear **orthotics** in my other shoes (like my New Balance 550s), but I **don‚Äôt need them** with the Clifton 9s and I‚Äôm still pain-free.

### **New Pair, Different Size**

Recently, my wife got me a **brand new pair of Clifton 9s** ‚Äî but I accidentally gave her the wrong size. She bought me a **size 9**, while my current pair is a 9.5.

Here‚Äôs what I noticed comparing them:

- **Size 9.5**:  
  - Fits great in terms of **width**  
  - There‚Äôs about a **full inch of toe space**  
  - No pain, very roomy  

- **Size 9**:  
  - **Better toe spacing** ‚Äî less wiggle room  
  - Width feels a **bit tighter**, but not uncomfortable  
  - Shoe feels snug overall, but it‚Äôs brand new so I expect it to break in  
  - No foot pain even without orthotics so far

---

### **My History with Hoka**

Before the Clifton 9s, I ran the **2019 Chicago Marathon** in a pair of **Hoka Bondi 1.5s**. Zero pain. I‚Äôve been a big fan of Hokas ever since. I like how much **support and cushion** they give, and I appreciate how **easy they are to find** locally (shoutout to Nordstrom) or online.

---

### **Question for You All**

Has anyone had success **wearing two sizes of Hoka Clifton 9s** (like a 9 and a 9.5) depending on the activity?

1jmrp6u,AskRunningShoeGeeks,looking for recommendations,"looking for some recommendations. sorry for the long post

I am a female long distance runner in her 20s who typically runs around 60ish miles per week (8-9 per day) and walks a TON as a first year medical student (\~20-25,000 steps a day). I previously ran for a D1 college who was sponsored by Nike so I ran all my easy runs in the pegasus for the last 4 years. I had a rough time in college because my coach was really hard on us and I ended up having 5 stress fractures in my 4 years there (several teammates in the same situation, some even career ending injuries). When I graduated, I got a pair of saucony triumphs and loved the cushion and support of that shoe. with the high mileage I do, I go through shoes pretty quickly so my next pair was asics gel nimbus which was nice but didn't love as much as my saucony's. I have tried hoka's but don't like how thick and heavy they feel or the tight toe box of the Clifton. with how much walking I do around campus and the hospital, I wear the hoka Bondi's but can't run in them. so I am looking for recommendations on what my next go to should be. 

ideally the shoe has a wider toe box, good amount of cushion for my bones and to prevent more stress fractures, light and responsive, fits well to my foot, and can take high mileage since most of my runs are long easy paced miles.

1jmrbrg,PlantarFasciitis,My personal guide to getting through travel and events with PF,"Obvious caveat: this is not medical advice, should not be taken as such, and anything and everything you do should be discussed with your doctor or PT. This is a list of thought processes that have helped me in the past. I have had PF for almost 2 years now, and in that time have gone on several walking-heavy vacations (7-9 miles/day), and have had events where I had to wear dress shoes for days (like my own wedding). This is intended to be a guide not to heal or improve, but a list of things that have helped me manage and enjoy my trips and events despite my circumstances and pain.

1. **This is the only real piece of general advice I will give here.** The biggest thing I will say to anyone suffering from this condition with big days ahead: **breathe, relax.** I say that not condescendingly, but with total empathy for what you are going through. Try to remember that it‚Äôs going to be okay. Make peace with the situation and personal limitations. The odds that you will be better or healed by the time your trip rolls around are small. There will be some discomfort and pain. That‚Äôs okay. Pain is a physical feeling, but you don't need to let it overtake your experience. I got married during a flare up, and it was the greatest day of my life. Yes my feet hurt on my honeymoon, but making peace with pain allowed it to remain a magical trip, and allowed me to more easily make mental and physical accommodations. Seriously, try to enjoy your trip/event. Don‚Äôt dwell on your lack of progress during these few days. Unless you physically cannot put one foot in front of the other, try to not let pain ruin a moment. Do the things you want to do unless you truly physically cannot.
 
2. **Medication**. For me, Naproxen OR Melixocam in the morning and some Tylenol in the afternoon worked wonders for my trip, especially when taken for a few days leading up to the trip as well. For my wedding day itself, lidocaine patches on my foot were game changers. They got me through the rehearsal and wedding in hard soled dress shoes. Truly, I did not feel A THING. I didn‚Äôt think about my feet once, and I was standing 95% of the day. These are not longterm solutions, especially lidocaine, but they are decent band aids that can help ease the pain during short bursts.

3. **Be okay looking dumb and make smart footwear decisions.**  Yeah I went to Italy and wore Saucony Guide 17s. I looked like a goofy American tourist. But it‚Äôs important for me to prioritize comfort over style. I wear the most comfortable shoes I have. This allowed me to walk longer distances and not need to stop too often or cut days short. I see a lot of posts from people who are comfortable while wearing Hokas or Oofos but want something new and different for a trip (more stylish), but I think I had the most success sticking to what worked at home. Similarly, if I need to stretch in a public place, some rando in Portugal or Japan might think I'm weird, but who cares. Do what you gotta do. 

4. **Pain mitigation and figuring out what helps.** In the weeks leading up to my trip/event, I experimented with KT tape, ice, heat, and rolling, as it pertained to short term relief. Remember, the goal here is not to be cured (though that would be great). **The real goal is to be able to walk 10k steps without wanting to cry.** If ice helps, bring some cold packs, and if heat helps, bring a portable heat pad. I personally cannot travel now without a lacrosse ball for my calves, but others may prefer a foam roller, or hate stretching entirely. When I realized that KT tape helped, I pre-cut all my KT tape for the week and had them ready for every morning. This reduced my pain only slightly, but enough to help me get through the day, especially along with everything else. I also found that low-arch insoles really helped on longer walking days, and used those with great success, and wearing crocs at my hotel also helped for recovery. This was and still is the hardest part of the process, because it involves some experimentation, and some honest assessment as to whether stuff works or doesn‚Äôt. 

5. **Rest.** Take care of yourself. Make time to sit, have a coffee, take off your shoes for a moment. If you need to sit during a museum visit, that‚Äôs okay! If you need to take an afternoon break at a cafe and have a glass of wine, even better! Building in the mental and scheduling flexibility for a sit or a pause or an hour back at the hotel was a game changer for me. Similarly, if you find that stretching or a PT routine offers relief, be sure to carve out some time for it.  

6. **PT-guided adjustments towards short term relief.** My PT routine is a twice-weekly circuit that focuses mainly on strength, but my feet are always sore afterwards for a day or so. In the cases where I am walking 15k steps a day, it‚Äôs best for me to hold off on strength routines for the week, otherwise I risk a bigger flare up mid trip. I also got some great advice from my PT on how to give myself some short term relief outside of the regular circuit, and I went back to my full time routine when I got back home.  

7. **Two unexpected danger zones: museums and showers.** Standing is hard on the feet, often harder than walking. Museums are really challenging places for PF because of the constant weight on your feet for hours without any dynamic movement. If we go to a museum, I go see what we want to see, but I try not to feel guilty if I'm not up for doing the WHOLE Louvre. Showers are also hard, because you‚Äôre barefoot and standing. Flip flops or crocs in the shower can be a game changer. I have a Helinox chair that folds up into something the size of a burrito, which I bring on really long trips, so I can sit if there is literally no where to sit and I can't bear to stand any longer. I also find that constantly standing on a street corner looking at my phone for directions greatly increases standing time and strain over the course of a day, so it helps me personally to have a general gist of the route before I set off (which also helps me be more present and less focused on my foot). 

8. **Set aside some money for cabs.** Yeah vacations are expensive, but sometimes you‚Äôre able to get more out of a vacation if you‚Äôre willing to spend an extra 10-20 dollars on a cab ride from some place that is otherwise unreachable by foot for you. Budget a few cab rides into your trip so you can afford to stretch your walking distance as much as possible. 

9. **Be mindful of trip companions.** My wife has heard endless complaints about my foot when I've been at my worst. But subjecting her to hours  of disquisitions on pain when we are abroad together is not fair to her, and it also isn't fair to me either. Personally, agreeing on my end to curtail rumination (unless it is solutions oriented like ""I need to find a place to sit"") greatly reduces the strain on both of us, and lets me be in the moment.",2025-03-29 17:23:11+00:00,46,9

1jmocmh,ValueInvesting,$NKE current market valuation - great opportunity.,"[Financials](https://www.valuemetrix.io/companies/NKE)  
  
1/ $NKE is down \~50% in 3 years.

But big investors like Bill Ackman are betting over $1B on a turnaround.

Why?

2/ $NKE's revenue fell 9% year-to-date.

Gross profits down 16%.

Earnings down 30%.

That‚Äôs a clear sign: they‚Äôre losing market share and margins are shrinking.

3/ The company misjudged consumer trends, leading to heavy discounting and excess inventory.

They‚Äôve now changed leadership and are trying to stabilize operations.

4/ Despite weak performance, they‚Äôre still:

* Raising the dividend
* Buying back shares

Some investors see this as the wrong signal in a turnaround phase.

5/ The losses aren‚Äôt isolated to one region.

Sales are down across the board:

* North America: -9%
* Europe: -11%
* China: -17%
* LATAM & APAC: -12%

Even Converse is down 18%.

6/ Competitors are taking share:

* $ONON: premium growth brand
* $SKX: growing fast at a cheaper price
* $DECK: Hoka running shoes up 24%

Nike‚Äôs appeal is slipping.

7/ Nike‚Äôs response?

* New marketing (first Super Bowl ad in 27 years)
* New running shoes (Pegasus Premium)
* Partnership with Kim Kardashian‚Äôs Skims

Trying to recapture attention + culture.

8/ Bulls are betting on brand durability.

Nike still has global recognition and athlete sponsorships.

But growth needs to return ‚Äî fast.

9/ Valuation?

At \~$100B market cap, this isn‚Äôt deep value.

It still trades at a premium multiple compared to brands like $CROX.

Wall Street expects a rebound.

10/ If $NKE grows 5‚Äì10% per year and stabilizes margins, you could double your money over time.

But if turnaround fails, downside risk remains.

11/ Not an easy bet. It‚Äôs a turnaround story.

Big funds are buying on the belief the brand will bounce back.

Personally? I‚Äôd rather wait for clarity.",2025-03-29 15:09:14+00:00,71,130
1jmo2bm,hiking,Any advice regarding shoes and blisters?,"I‚Äôm training for a 26 mile charity hike in July, just generally getting my fitness up etc but I‚Äôm struggling so much with blisters.

For about 3 months I wore in and walked in Hoka Anacapa 2 Low GORE-TEX. I‚Äôm around a size 4.5 and would wear size 5 with blister heal plasters, thin toe socks, jelly/silicone heals and then a pair of darn tough socks on top. But a 15 mile training hike ending miserably when I got horrendous blisters on my heals as well as soles and toes. 

I‚Äôve switched to an old pair of walking boots I wore when I hiked the blue ridge mountains a few years ago but today I had to cut a walk short after 7 miles because I could feel the same happening, even though I don‚Äôt remember having problems with them in the past. 

I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm wearing too many layers but if I don‚Äôt the blisters happen faster. I have narrow feet and did ballet in pointe shoes for over 15 years so my feet are kinda fucked. I don‚Äôt seem to be healing great anymore and the skin on my heals is so thin. 

Current plan: try some good insoles. Go to a shop for some advice/expert opinions. 

I‚Äôm demoralised. I love getting out and walking and challenging myself and getting fitter while doing it but I‚Äôm a bit stuck. Any advice is appreciated.

I try to do a decent walk most weekends when off work but have an active job and always on my feet. I always have struggled with blisters my whole life. ",2025-03-29 14:56:25+00:00,0,17

1jmlxnz,InterviewVampire,An industry professional writing an entire essay raving about Jacob Anderson,"The talented language creator David Peterson (who created Dothraki and Valyrian for game of thrones) geeking about Jacob is so relatable. :D

This is the scene he is referencing [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvcJuoW0KlU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvcJuoW0KlU)

\-----------------------------------------------------

@[dedalvs](https://www.tumblr.com/dedalvs)¬†¬†David Peterson:

Pardon me, but is someone praising Jacob Anderson without letting *me* praise him first?!

Backing up. It's October 2009, and my Dothraki is chosen as the official version for HBO's *Game of Thrones*. Absolutely the job of a *lifetime*. Conlangers were never hired to create languages for big budget productions, and language was central to *A Song of Ice and Fire*. The fact that this was on HBO guaranteed that it was going to be huge, and now I was going to get to be on the set of a TV show, work with actors, go to Hollywood parties, and create a language that would be as popular as Klingon.

June 2011, only one of those four things had happened, and of all things, it was going to a Hollywood party‚Äîthe season 1 premiere event for *Game of Thrones*. It was very cool! None of the cast attended, but it was cool! But as for the rest, the idea that *I* would ever actually talk to any of the actors or be on the actual set was, apparently, laughable. And as for Dothraki, it had a very loyal following of about 6 or 7 people, all of whom I came to know personally. Dothraki was discussed in the press, sure, but nobody was going to learn it; there were never going to be any Dothraki conventions. It wasn't the next Klingon.

June 2012, and by this point I'd gotten used to seeing my work on screen‚Äîand by that I mean I'd gotten used to seeing it performed‚Ä¶so-so. Every so often it was really good, but for the most part, I got used to hearing jumbled consonants, dropped syllables, missed words‚Ä¶ I've always been a perfectionist, so this was difficult, but I didn't have much choice. I had absolutely no control over it. I never got to work with any of the actors, so all they had were my recordings, and a series of dialect coaches who had absolutely no idea what they were doing with my stuff. (And, as I would learn later, just because an actor nails 9 out of 10 takes doesn't mean the editor won't like the one take they screwed up. Sometimes that's the take that makes it to the screen.) Basically, if someone has an English line on a TV show that goes ""It looks like the mechanism got screwed up somehow"", and what they say is ""It locks like a manism got scroot up someho"", they're going to reshoot the scene until the actor says it right. If that happens with a conlang, no one will notice or care. This was now my life.

July 2012, I get the opportunity to create High Valyrian (yay!), and then a ""dialect"" of High Valyrian to be spoken in Slaver's Bay. Knowing the history from GRRM's books, I knew this ""dialect"" was actually a full daughter language with lexical/phonological material from an extinct language (Ghiscari) that I wasn't being asked to create, so I was going to have to create *two* languages at once, and at least have an idea for a third one‚Äîand, in fact, there was going to be a *lot* of dialogue in this new daughter language. Consequently my focus was split. I can honestly barely remember creating Astapori Valyrian, because I wanted to be sure that High Valyrian was right (I knew book fans didn't care about Dothraki, but *did* care about HV). Despite the lack of attention, I did realize that Astapori Valyrian had a cool sound and a great flow (it really does!). I wish I'd had more time to appreciate creating it as a daughter language (I wish High Valyrian had been as complete as Dothraki was at that point), but I was pleased with the result. I was curious to see how the actors would handle it.

April 21, 2013. I am absolutely over the moon. I'd just for the first time saw a scene that I loved in the books because, for once, I predicted what was going to happen (as a reader, I'm sitting here thinking, ""How do you trade your *entire army* to someone and not wonder if they're going to use it on you after they get it?!""), and it actually plays *better* in the show than the books, and it all hinges on a language I created. I still get chills watching that scene: [Episode 304, Daenerys revealing she speaks Valyrian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph8CPHgzi5Y). To this day that's still the best thing I've done. The same issues I mentioned above were present, as always (watching thinking, ""Did she say *mebatas* instead of *memƒìbƒÅtƒÅs*‚Ä¶?""), but they're minor. The scene is outstanding. I realized that *whatever* was going to happen after this, I would always have this scene. That was a good night.

April 28, 2013. After last week's episode, I wasn't really waiting for anything. In episode 305 there's only one scene with any conlang work in it‚Äînothing really major. Introducing Grey Worm, characterization, etc. Everything in this episode is about what's going on in Westeros. At this point I'd heard a fair amount of Astapori Valyrian in Slaver's Bay. It was good! Definitely good enough. Did the trick. The prosody wasn't quite what I did with it, but it was good. I was somewhat interested in this introduction in 305. Grey Worm only speaks Astapori Valyrian at this point, so this actor wouldn't have had had any other speaking lines, and aside from one short line and saying his name at the beginning, his next line is a *huuuuuge* speech, comparatively speaking. I was curious to see how he would do.

**Critters and gentlefolk, that night I witnessed a miracle.**

***NEVER*** **had I heard** ***ANYONE*** **speak one of my languages better than me until that night.**

**Every word, every syllable,** ***EVERY SOUND OF EVERY CLAUSE*** **Jacob ""You Heard My Name"" Anderson uttered was ABSOLUTELY FLAWLESS.**

**I was stunned. My mouth literally hung open‚Äîprobably for the rest of the damn episode, at which point I went back and watched that scene‚Äîagain, and again, and again.**

And so you don't have to go searching, this is Grey Worm's line (not the first two short ones‚Äîthe big one \[note: *j* is \[ í\], except in Daenery's *High* Valyrian name, where it's \[d í\], *dh* is \[√∞\], *q* is \[q\], *r* is \[…æ\] and *y* is \[y\], in IPA\]):

>*‚ÄúTorgo Nudho‚Äù hokas bezy. Sa me broji beri. Ji broji ez bezo sene stas qimbroto. Kuny iles ji broji meles esko mazedhas derari va buzdar. Y Torgo Nudho sa ji broji ez bezy eji tovi Daenerys Jelmazmo ji teptas ji derve.*

That was my translation of this English line:

>‚ÄúGrey Worm‚Äù gives this one pride. It is a lucky name. The name this one was born with was cursed. That was the name he had when he was taken as a slave. But Grey Worm is the name this one had the day Daenerys Stormborn set him free.

That is a *LOOOOOOOOOONG* ass line. [**And go watch that scene**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvcJuoW0KlU). There is nothing on the screen but his face. It's a closeup the entire time. Any slight deviation would be visible as well as audible. Take a look:

This...*KING* just casually dropped the greatest performance I have ever witnessed on screen at a time when I had already given up on ever seeing a truly great conlang performance on screen.

And then he proceeded to do it again and again and again and again and again for the rest of the entire show. I don't think it's a coincidence that the very last conlang line of *Game of Thrones* is his. They knew how much I loved him‚ÄîI told them. I told anyone who would listen and twelve people who wouldn't, along with their next of kin. He didn't take my language and make it his own‚Äîno, no. He is graciously allowing me to claim that I created his native tongue‚Äîthe one he's been speaking since birth. *THAT'S* how good he is.

**So yeah, accent work? In English? I guess I'm not surprised he's pretty good at that. Something like that to this‚Ä¶*****adonis*****, this living, breathing Master Class‚Ñ¢ in perfection is like yawning to an ordinary human. Jacob Anderson can walk into my house in the dead of night, take anything out of my refrigerator, and then leave the door to the fridge** ***and the house*** **open when he leaves. He has earned no less.i know it's been said many times before but i will never get over how jacob anderson, a british man with a british accent, not only nailed a louisiana creole accent but also developed a studiously (almost eerily) generic accent that louis uses in the present AND showed the first accent bleeding into the second accent at key moments as a way of aurally externalizing his character's inner journey. what did god put in this man when she created him.**

1jmllq1,walking,Seeking Guidance on Shoe Fit for Walking,"I recently bought a pair of Hoka Transports and immediately found the toe box to be incredibly small and uncomfortable. My basic question is, can anyone recommend a brand/style that has a roomier toe box at very high sizing? (long feet, not necessarily wide tho) more details below.


I generally struggle to find shoes that fit properly. I'm a US-14 or UK 13 (sometimes UK 13.5). This time I got UK 13.5 and was just shocked at how small the toe box was. It did seem long enough, at least. I have noticed in the past that as shoe sizes get longer, sometimes manufacturers don't do a good job expanding at the right scale. The shoe gets longer but gets more ""pointy"" and narrow. 

Anyone else out there with long feet find a good fit for comfortable walking shoes? Thanks in advance. ",2025-03-29 12:52:00+00:00,1,2
1jmkm6e,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Shoes that fit similair to Glycerin 22?,"Dear (running)shoe oracles

I have been trying more than 30+ shoes the past month to find one that fit my feet.

I finally found the Brooks Glycerin 22 and have been walking in them the past two days. Everything good so far. Can you recommend a shoe which has a similar sizing/contour? 

Although my feet arent ""traditionally"" wide, it appears I struggle to find shoes that fit them correctly. Brooks/Saucony appears to have good baseline fit for my feet in general. In other words sort of wide forefoot, but a narrow midfoot if it makes sense. Neutral shoes are preferred, I have a very slight pronation on my right foot I am working on.

Now, I would like another shoe I can alternate with the Glycerin simply for flexibility, longevity and feet health purposes.

I do not plan to run with them, if I do it will be short runs. I will primarily use both shoes for everyday wear/walking in a city/office.

Hence a complete black version or similair discrete color options are must.

Shoes I have been recommended and tried on without sucess recently.

Brooks Ghost 2

Brooks Ghost 2 max

Saucony Hurricane 24

Asics Kayano 14, 31 

Asics 1130 

Hoka Bondi 9 and Cliffton 9

All the above are too narrow for my right foot.

I know that the Ghost 2 also comes in a wide version, I will look for a store that has it.

Asics Nimbus 27 also felt decent.

Saucony Cohesion and Triumph are both on my try-on list.

I live in Europe btw, so options are a bit limited unless I order online.

My experience:
30's male. Not grossly overweight but a bit chunky(context for the rest of the story)I just finished my first week as a CNA and my feet *a c h e* !! I wear boots from my previous job in food service. They wouldn't hurt like they do now. My feet feel like they don't have enough space by the pinky toes. But the boots really irritate and inflame the tendons on the hind foot (lower shin/ front part of foot)

New shoe hunt:
I was just at Dick's sporting goods because I heard so many good things about Hoka shoes; and well.. the just didn't cut it. So much foam rigidity. It felt like a nice comfortable shoe but it wasn't a magical moment of relief. Like when I first tried some Eddie Bauer walking shoe a few years ago. Same for the ON shoes(although they do wrap around the ankle in a really nice way) I feel like the new balance fresh foam is a huge runner-up( unintended pun) but most model types had a heavy emphasis on fore-foot support, and just didn't do it. So I left empty handed. 

Wish list on a shoe:
-coushy heel foam
-roomy by the toe
Bonus if: waterproof, or non-slip (for obvious cna reasons)

Recommendations welcome and appreciated from all healthcare workers!

TLDR; First week as a CNA. feet are destroyed. Tried Hokas & ONs, no luck. Need shoes with cushy heel, roomy toe box, and ideally waterproof/non-slip. Help!",2025-03-29 04:37:37+00:00,5,39

I‚Äôm was planning on wearing my pair of Altras, but I used them to run recently (they‚Äôre trail runners) and I think they gave me a stress fracture in my foot‚Ä¶.which obviously is making me doubt using them for the Camino. My normal daily tennis shoes are Hoka brand‚Ä¶so I‚Äôm considering switching to their trail runners. Or maybe something else if lots of people recommend certain brands/styles!

1jm7gjo,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Best race-day upgrade from Arahi 7?,"Hi guys, I‚Äôm running my first half marathon in May, and I‚Äôm looking to upgrade from my Hoka Arahi 7 to something faster. I still want some stability but with a more responsive feel for race day.

I‚Äôve been eyeing the Saucony Tempus, but I‚Äôm a bit worried about the arch height compared to the Arahi. I find the arch support on the Arahi 7 really good for my feet, so I‚Äôm concerned that a higher arch might not work as well for me. Does anyone have experience with both? Or are there other stability-ish, faster shoes I should consider?",2025-03-28 22:25:54+00:00,1,2
1jm3e4h,RunningShoeGeeks,Saucony Ride 17 400 Mile Review,"Since the Ride 18 is now available, this is for those trying to make a decision on whether it‚Äôs worth buying a discounted pair of 17s.

Male runner, 5‚Äô10‚Äù, 180 lbs, 20-25mpw, heel striker. I run for fun not performance so I don‚Äôt have identified 5k/10k/HM paces but I‚Äôm generally running 7-10 miles with a pace in the range of 7:30-8:20 min/mile. Haven‚Äôt pushed further on distance because I‚Äôm a middle aged guy trying to build back up slowly after injury, no doubt that these shoes will hold up well on longer distances. Rotate Ride 17 as road daily with ES2 for road tempo and Endorphin Edge for trail.

This shoe was my return to Saucony after a foray through On and Hoka. Left On for all the normal reasons, Hoka because I got tired of running on marshmallows. Shoes felt great from the beginning and improved with some break in. Firmer but not too firm. Adapts well to different paces from slow to moderate to low end tempo, though won‚Äôt push to the paces I can get with ES2. In the best way, it‚Äôs a shoe I don‚Äôt notice - though not the lightest it doesn‚Äôt feel heavy; neither slowing me down or speeding me up; I never finish a run with my feet hurting or my legs sore from the shoe.

Upper not the most breathable but also didn‚Äôt feel hot to me; then again my feet tend to not feel hot in shoes anyway for some reason. Great in cold weather; I can definitely feel the cold in my ES2s but not these.

I bought a half size too large which gave me some lockdown issues, which caused the rubbing you‚Äôll see the top of the heel, especially on my left foot (half size shorter than right). Improved once I got a better lockdown. Outside of that, upper has always been comfortable, no hotspots or blisters or other issues.

Wet traction isn‚Äôt great - feels a tad slippy but has never caused an injury or fall. Moreso just feel the lack of traction and lose a few seconds off my pace.

Already have another pair ready to replace these (though in the right size), but may be a while. I‚Äôve never had a shoe feel this awesome at 400 miles and expect another 100+ miles in them. Recommend as a great stable neutral daily trainer to affordably eat up miles in comfort. They may not pop like Novablasts (while the pop lasts) or fly like Evo SL (if you can handle the Evo SL‚Äôs instability), but are a great jack of all trades. Can‚Äôt match the combination or comfortable upper + TPU foam + durability at this price point.",2025-03-28 19:28:56+00:00,73,30

1jm10gw,Newbalance,Best shoe at each price point?,"I'm looking to get into my first pair of NB for my birthday in the next couple months. My main questions is what shoe is best for the price? Obviously its very personal what shoe is best for who. So for some context, I work a desk job but take a 2 1/2 mile walk OR a 10 mile bike ride during my lunch break if the weather is good enough. But I occasionally go to job sites to measure stuff. Other than that I have an almost 3 year old who obviously keeps me on my feet and likes taking walks when I get home as well. So I don't think I walk the more than the average person but I do notice some strain in my front outer shin muscle while taking longer walks at a higher pace. 

  
My main contenders are:  
2002R-$150  
990v6-$200  
992 (mushroom preferably)-$250  
991v2-$250

I want to stick to the sneaker style above the trainer/runner look but am no opposed to them overall. I've been wearing a pair of Hoka's I found at Ross a year ago and they're starting to show there wear and seemingly becoming less comfortable as well. ",2025-03-28 17:48:41+00:00,1,7

1jlyc6i,UKhiking,140 miles in 7 days completed!,"Just wanted to update as I‚Äôd posted a couple of times about my 140 mile in 7 days walk for charity. I finished yesterday and have raised over ¬£2300 and wanted to share a bit about my experience as prior to this, I thought a long walk was a 2 mile round trip to get a Greggs coffee so wanted to give confidence to anyone who deems themself a beginner to long distance walking.

- I used OS maps to plan the route (Manchester-Lincoln-Nottingham) - my advice would be to learn the topographic map as it shows boundaries (in my case fence lines) which was helpful for finding stiles as sometimes the actual route line wasn‚Äôt in the right place 

- I decided to go with Hoka Anacapa 2 lows after a fitting at Ellis Brigham - they are a size bigger than I normally wear and I had insoles, I also got a pair of merrells as a back up (which were helpful when I got blisters) I had been training in smart wool socks but these were far too warm by the time I got to the actual walk (typical March!) so I just switched to normal cotton and was fine (I got the blisters on the only day I wore the smart wool which was ironic!)

- speaking of blisters, I trained for around 4 months (I‚Äôd already been going to the gym for a couple of years consistently) and gradually increased my miles each week - I never ever got a blister and then for some reason on day 1 I got 2! I was beyond the help of compeed at this point and someone on here mentioned chiropody felt which I got the day before and this was a life saver! 

- company was a huge help, I was lucky that I had company on day 1, 2, 4 and then half of 5 and 7 so I only had to do a couple of days completely alone but days 3&4 were the hardest which is what a lot of people had told me - there were a lot of tears and doubt but I just had to keep putting one foot in front of the other! 

- K tape was an absolute life saver, I think I was quite lucky as I didn‚Äôt get any real issues with my joints but my calves became really sore by day 4 after 2 days of hills through the peaks and Sheffield so taping them helped relieve this as well as some foot stiffness!

Poles - just get them, they absolutely saved me on the hills and also useful for waggling at a bunch of very curious cows! 

I think they are the main things, I learnt a lot about myself and I‚Äôm thrilled I was able to do it and I‚Äôve definitely got the bug now to do some Peak District walks if anyone has any recommendations!

A week later the first pair started squeaking, so I tried the trick of putting powder under the insole(not using anything custom, just the one that came with the shoe). That works well, but they still squeak occasionally, and require powder regularly, so I went back to Clifton‚Äôs. 

Recently I went on a trip to the UK and wanted a pair of GTX, in case of rain, so I gave the Transport GTX‚Äôs a try. I wore them for a week straight in the UK with no issues, so I bought a second pair in another color assuming the squeaking issue was resolved. Well, the first pair recently started squeaking, and powder really isn‚Äôt making a difference, so I‚Äôm considering just returning the second pair given that they‚Äôre $175.

## Why Choose Dedicated Treadmill Running Shoes?

While it might be tempting to use your outdoor running shoes on the treadmill, there are compelling reasons to invest in a pair specifically designed for indoor use.

## Understanding Your Needs: Key Considerations Before You Buy

Before we dive into specific recommendations, let's discuss the factors you should consider when choosing the *best running shoes for treadmill* workouts.

Understanding your arch type is crucial. Do you have flat feet, high arches, or a neutral arch? This will significantly impact the type of support you need.

*   **Flat Feet:** Individuals with flat feet frequently enough overpronate, meaning their feet roll inward excessively during the gait cycle. Look for *stability running shoes treadmill* designed to control motion and provide support.
*   **High Arches:** People with high arches tend to supinate, meaning their feet roll outward. This can lead to less shock absorption.*Cushioned running shoes treadmill* are ideal for providing extra padding and flexibility.
*   **Neutral Arches:** If you have a neutral arch,you‚Äôre in luck! You have more flexibility in your shoe choices. Look for shoes that offer a balance of cushioning and support.

**Running Style and Training Goals:**

Are you a casual jogger or a serious marathon trainer? Your training intensity and frequency will influence the type of shoe you need. if you're doing high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on the treadmill, you might prefer a shoe with more responsiveness. If you're logging long miles, cushioning and comfort are paramount. Selecting *treadmill training shoes* should consider your planned workouts.

**Breathability:**

*Breathable treadmill shoes* are essential for keeping your feet cool and dry during indoor workouts. Treadmills are usually found in closed environments which may have a bad ventilation system or none at all.

This is especially crucial for those in warmer climates or who sweat heavily.

**Cushioning and Comfort:**

*Cozy treadmill shoes* are critical for protecting your joints and minimizing impact. Adequate cushioning helps absorb shock and reduce strain on your knees, ankles, and hips. Look for shoes with responsive midsoles made from materials like EVA foam or gel. *Cushioned running shoes treadmill* that offer a plush feel without sacrificing energy return are ideal.

**Stability and support:**

*Supportive treadmill shoes* are notably important for runners who overpronate or need extra stability. These shoes typically feature medial posts or other supportive elements that help control foot motion and prevent injuries.Look for shoes that provide a secure fit and prevent excessive rolling.

**Weight:**

*Lightweight treadmill running shoes* can help you feel more nimble and agile during your workouts. When every ounce counts, a lighter shoe can reduce fatigue and improve your overall performance.

## Tips for Finding the Perfect Fit

Once you've narrowed down your choices, it's essential to try on the shoes to ensure a proper fit. Here are some tips:

*   **Shop in the afternoon or evening:** your feet tend to swell throughout the day,so it's best to try on shoes when your feet are at their largest.
*   **Wear socks that you would normally wear for running:** This will ensure that the shoes fit properly with your usual running gear.*   **Walk or run around the store:** Don't just stand there! Take a few steps or even a short jog to get a feel for the shoes.
*   **Make sure there's enough room in the toe box:** You should have about a thumb's width of space between your longest toe and the end of the shoe.
*   **pay attention to any areas of discomfort:** If you feel any rubbing, pinching, or pressure points, the shoes are not a good fit.
*   **Consider getting a professional fitting:** Many specialty running stores offer gait analysis and fitting services to help you find the *best rated treadmill shoes* for your needs.

## Maintaining Your Treadmill Running Shoes

Once you've found the perfect pair of *treadmill shoes for men* or *treadmill shoes for women*, it's crucial to take care of them to prolong their lifespan. Here are some tips:

*   **Clean your shoes regularly:** Use a damp cloth to wipe away dirt and sweat. Avoid using harsh chemicals or detergents.
*   **Air dry your shoes:** Never put your shoes in the dryer, as this can damage the materials. Remove the insoles and allow them to air dry separately.
*   **Rotate your shoes:** If you run frequently, consider having two pairs of shoes and alternating between them. This will allow the cushioning to recover and extend the life of each pair.
*   **inspect your shoes regularly:** Check for signs of wear and tear, such as worn-out treads, frayed uppers, or compressed midsoles. Replace your shoes when they start to lose their cushioning or support.

1jl2b8c,PlantarFasciitis,My plantar fasciitis is returning,"TLDR: I need new shoes for work (vet tech). My Hoka Bondi 9s are causing my pain to return. Any recommendations?

I am going through a bit of a struggle with finding new shoes for work. I started wearing Hokas back in 2021 when I first bought the Bondi 7s. They were a god send. My pain went away within a month after years (6 to be exact) of struggling. Since then I‚Äôve been a Bondi devotee. The Bondi 8s made my feet fatigue easily. Looking back now I think it‚Äôs because I didn‚Äôt get wide fit (I didn‚Äôt realize until recently that my feet are widening out, which is a good thing). I think the 8s were actually strengthening my feet. Then I bought the 9s once they dropped. I noticed first day they were not going to work. I immediately returned them same week and bought barefoot shoes. 
I actually really like the barefoot shoes; however, I think I need ever so slightly, a little bit of cushion and they did increase my knee pain. I noticed that I walk heel first and I‚Äôm pretty heavy with it. They were starting to hurt my feet so I panicked. I then bought Brooks Glycerine GTS. Same issue, I could tell within the week they were not going to work out. 
After all of that I convinced myself ‚Äúmaybe I didn‚Äôt give the Bondi 9s enough time. They wouldn‚Äôt betray me.‚Äù I‚Äôve been wearing them for 2 weeks now and my heels are in so much pain. I don‚Äôt know what to do. 
I‚Äôm tired of this limbo I‚Äôm in with buying and returning shoes. ",2025-03-27 12:04:28+00:00,21,47
1jl08ft,RunningShoeGeeks,Saucony Speed 4 after 200km,"M 6ft2 85kg Mar 2.58 HM 1.26 mid foot striker 

Shoes I own. Adios pro 3, Cielo x1, Novablast 5, puma magmax, HOKA Bondi 9 

Aware this shoe has been reviewed to death but thought would give my view on it for anyone considering it at the moment. 

How I have used it: original purchased for a road ultra marathon but quickly figured out it wasn‚Äôt for that (more on that later). Generally using for distances between 10 - 30km with paces ranging from 3:30 to 4:45 (km per min). So have used it as more a speed shoe or uptempo shoe. I did also do a 3:08 marathon in them as part of the testing for an ultra shoe so have put some decent miles into them. 

Fit: very comfortable upper and fits me tts. Maybe slightly long but would go tts. There is a bit of an aggressive ‚Äútaper‚Äù (if that the right word) at the front of your shoe by your small toes so had a little bit of rubbing there but wasn‚Äôt an issue after the first run or two. For reference though I have a pretty narrow foot so could see that being a potential issue for wider foot individuals. 

Ride: if I had to sum it up it in a sentence it would be ‚Äúmid amount of cushion, but a firmer shoe that prefers quicker speeds‚Äù. I saw some reviews talking about how it is nice and cushioned while having a good bounce, but this wasn‚Äôt my experience in them. To me it gave you quite a planted feeling to the ground, while being fairly firm and stiff. When you cruising at around 5 pace and under its work well but found anything around 5:30-6 (km pace) just a little flat and uncomfortable. 
I also see it be suggested quite often as an affordable (not really) marathon race option. But for the previously mentioned race I ran I have never gotten to the end of a race with my legs feeling so beat up, by the end felt I was almost running barefoot and was getting nothing out of the shoes. So would rather get a discounted pair of carbon race shoes which will probably be cheaper anyway.

Aware it all sounds negative but they certainly work at certain areas. Speed or harder efforts up to 20/25km I think they do well especially when you pushing closer to that 4-4:30 pace. Also a bit more specific to me but have enjoyed them for my track workout as always feel a little unstable in my race shoes going around those bends so me it has worked great on a track cause of how planted I feel in them.
But if you wanting a great long run/marathon shoe I would look at something else. 

Durability: been decent. Starting to see some scuff marks on the non protected areas of the soles which doesn‚Äôt really happen this soon for me but otherwise been fine. 
To the durability the sole is fine but find it very slippery in the wet so would be careful using it in wet conditions. 

Summary: for the price you pay for these I would give it a miss. They decent shoes but not ¬£175 shoes. Especially when you starting to see some super shoes close to that. 
But if you wanting a tempo or speed shoe in your rotation and prefer the firmer/closer to the ground feeling then think these are a good option to consider. 
But if you wanting a do it all shoe I would probably suggest something else. 

Happy to answer any questions.

1jkybqy,AskDocs,42M Left Foot Pain in Arch,"Hi there,

I‚Äôve had foot pain in the arch of my foot for over a year now.  That comes and goes depending on what  I‚Äôm doing or wearing while on my feet.  

I went to a podiatrist thinking it was plantar fasciitis  and I got corticosteroid shots over a few weeks period. After the shots wore off, the pain still came back. The podiatrist thought it could be neurological because he saw varicose veins on the side of that foot below where the ankle meets the foot and asked me if I had pain near there? I wasn‚Äôt sure if i did or not. But he was sure it was neurological.  So I was told to see a neurologist. 

I went to the neurologist and she couldn‚Äôt find anything as to why my foot hurts. Mentioned the varicose veins and she didn‚Äôt seem to see anything about that.  

She said possibly rheumatoid arthritis. I know that affected some people in my family. But at 42? She then said just go back to your GP as she wasn‚Äôt sure. 

I‚Äôm at a loss here as to what the heck it can be. 

I did change my footwear. I wear Hokas for footwear with insoles. 

When i wear my boots with insoles, I do get the pain back in my foot. 

Doing yoga seems to help with the pain. 

Any ideas? I literally don‚Äôt know what else to do here. My job requires me to be on my feet for long periods. I just want this pain to stop already.

1jktfkn,AskRunningShoeGeeks,"Wide, stable, and fast? Can‚Äôt find anything that fits all these criteria","Context:

I used the hoka gaviota 5 wide for a few months because the guy at the running store strongly urged me to get stability shoes due to overpronation. These shoes didn‚Äôt fit my feet that well, so I switched to novablast 5 wide because I wanted to try a neutral shoe.

The novablast was way faster and a better fit, but after using it for a few months i‚Äôve developed pain in my foot which seems like peroneal tendonitis.

1jk5dtq,sesamoid,Fracture diagnosis after 10 months since the pain started,"My really frustrating journey so far:
- May 2024: right foot started hurting when walking.
- July 2024: Dr confirmed no gout and an xray was taken. The doctor did not identified any fracture.
- September 2024: went to see a podiatrist who told me it was either sesamoiditis or sesamoid fracture. He said I could get an MRI but the treatment is essentially the same at the beginning so he recommended me to start the treatment right away. He put me into a boot. Being in the boot made my foot hurt worse.
- October 2024: got off the boot after wearing it for two weeks because of the pain and a planned trip. The podiatrist told me to buy a pair of cheap insoles and made a cutout for the sesamoid on the right foot. Walked 20,000-30,000 for two weeks straight during my trip. Still in pain but I wasn‚Äôt paying much attention to it during the trip. Kept wearing the same insole afterwards.
- December 2024-February 2025: went back to the podiatrist and told him there wasn‚Äôt much improvement. He recommends customized orthotics ($700) which I was not ready to pay for. Told him I would hold off to give the cutout insole longer time to understand if I should commit to customized orthotics. Wore and switched between two pairs of shoes (1 pair of NB sneakers with the cutout insole, 1 pair of Hoka Bondi worn with dancers pad) 
- March 2025: pain still persisted but maybe improved. Was reconsidering customized insole. Went to get a second opinion from a different podiatrist. He took a new xray which shows a small fracture but couldn‚Äôt confirm. He prescribed an MRI. MRI was taken last week and here is the result: ‚ÄúNondisplaced fracture of the medial hallux sesamoid bone, with minimal surrounding edema in the fracture fragments, suggestive of at least a subacute chronicity with possible component of osteonecrosis.   Alignment is well maintained.  Soft tissues are unremarkable.‚Äù 

I would really appreciate  some recommendations and tips on what I should do next! I definitely want to avoid surgery until I really try everything. Should I go back to the boot? At this point, I am just frustrated.My activity level is low when I work from home.  When I commute to the office, I walk for 8,000-10,000 steps a day three days a week.  I am going back to see the second podiatrist next week to get more information on the MRI. ",2025-03-26 06:24:04+00:00,3,11

1jk4ptp,sesamoid,When to remove the boot (currently 6 weeks in)? Sesamoid on uninjured foot aching a bit - And how to build up to walking again ?,"Hi everyone- this is a long one 

Tl;dr: how long should I stay in the moonboot when my right foot (original injury) is finally improving but my left foot sesamoid and arch is starting to ache (overcompensating) I'm terrified of creating a new injury in my non-boot left foot 

Back story: 

My initial diagnosis was severe sesamoiditis/pre-stress fracture in the right sesamoid. 
My podistrist has been really vague recently, not replying to emails etc. I sought a second opinion who have me completely different advice a few weeks ago. She padded out my Hoka and informed me to ease out of the boot and start using hokas (however I tried this for a few days and my sesamoid flaired up and become much more painful) ..

So I'm taking healing into my own hands at the moment as I can't keep affording more specialists and scans. (My partner is currently in between jobs and I'm a SAHM to a toddler/also studying online)

Since that appointment with the Podiatrist who recommended the hoka shoe, I've been wearing the boot as my foot was still very inflammed at the time and the shoe made it worse. 

So now I've had about 6 weeks in the boot I'm finally starting to feel some gradual improvement. For example if I stand barefoot on a soft surface, rather than a sharp stabbing pain on the sesamoid area, there is more or an ache than a sharp stab.
It's really promising. My gut is saying to stay in the boot at least for a few more weeks. That will bring us to 8 weeks. Some people on here have even suggested 12 weeks.

This is where the problem comes in. My left foot is starting to ache in a similar spot to where the left injury initially started. It's freaking me out because I'm terrified of now injuring the left foot as well. The pain is about 1-2 out of 10.  I think my left foot is holding onto the last shred of my sanity, I can't imagine walking around in two moonboots with a toddler. I'm suspecting that maybe the left foot has been overcompensating and is now starting to ache/stiffen. My partner has reminded me that I'm probably hyper aware of foot sensations now and a bit of stiffness/aching doesn't mean full injury, it just might be irritated. It's just scary because this is how the pain my right foot started, which I pushed through and then developed the pre-stress fracture.

So I'm not sure what to do. Do I take the boot off soon even though my right foot doesn't feel fully healed. That way there will be more even wight distribution ?
Or do I keep the right boot on longer because 
it seems to be really helping with the original sesamoiditis, however I'm scared the left foot is going to develop it.

Do you guys think it's even possible to develop sesamoiditis in the left foot given im seated/resting most of the day due to my moonboot, steps are under about 1500 per day. I'm literally just hobbling around my apartment and not doing anywhere. 

Any experiences, tips or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. 
Than you ",2025-03-26 05:36:04+00:00,3,11
1jk3dw9,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Needing shoes for disability- older models similar to the new ones?,"Hi,

[background]
I've been on this sub frequently as I have never once been interested in running shoes, until now. I'm a new cane user also using compression socks and sometimes a back brace. My new physical therapist recommended i get some good cushion shoes like running shoes. I've gone to REI, every shoe store in my nearest mall, and searched everywhere online for deals and I am lost. I have a heavy step and I'm a bit unsteady, so my feet start to hurt very quickly when I walk with normal Nike or Adidas shoes. 

I (size 8 men) like the Brooks Glycerin 22 the most with the Hoka Bondi 9 coming in second. I've tried a couple types of the New Balance Fresh Foam ones alongside the 9060s. I'm mainly looking for a good cushion but ones I can still feel the ground a bit (like the Glycerin 22), that way I know when my balance is off when I step. The toe rocker on the Bondi 9 was life changing, making it easier to step and not scuff my heels. I love the Bondi mostly for the look (thick sole and doesn't immediately have that running shoe look) while having a great cushion. Though the sole is way too thick and other later models don't seem to have that same cushion. The NB were a good mix of both, taking the lead in aesthetics. Trying to find a wider shoe.

Are there any shoes (running or not) that has that stable, but plush cushion (perhaps a good insole could solve this issue?) of an older model of any of the mentioned? Or just anything else? The $200~ price point with no chance of sales any time soon is tough, but there has to be similar shoes from past years...right?  Preferably I'd like it to have a bit of a unique form or color way that doesn't give that ""dad on a stroll"" look lol. Share anything you've got, I'll go later this week to try on more shoes before committing to anything. ",2025-03-26 04:11:30+00:00,1,0
1jk3b3b,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Looking for Advice on New Running Shoes,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm looking to buy a new pair of running shoes for my upcoming races and could use some feedback on potential options. Right now, I‚Äôve been running in a really old pair of Nikes, but it‚Äôs definitely time for an upgrade.

My upcoming races include a 50K trail run (mostly on grass and some single track with rolling hills‚Äînothing too technical), a 10K Spartan race, and a Spartan trifecta weekend.

Most of my training runs are on the road near my house, but I also have some nice trail running areas within driving distance.

I‚Äôve been considering the Hoka Challenger 7, Nike Pegasus Trail 5, and possibly something more trail-focused like the Speedgoat 5 or Zegama 2. My main question is: Would a more trail-oriented shoe be a bad choice for road running? Or would these options still work well? Should I be looking at a more hybrid road-to-trail shoe instead? I know a hybrid would likely be the most versatile, but I also want something that will serve me well for future ultras.

For reference, I wear a size 8.5 and have a relatively narrow foot, so I don‚Äôt need a wide-fit option.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!",2025-03-26 04:06:54+00:00,2,1

Based of what I‚Äôve seen everything is either dead straight against the ground or you‚Äôre stacked up pretty high. I don‚Äôt know of many middle ground options and love reviews from people who‚Äôve put some serious miles on em. ",2025-03-25 03:29:51+00:00,0,4
1jja8yv,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Salomon or hoka,"Hi all l'm a beginner runner. I used to run occasionally about 6 years ago now, and am now getting back into it wanting to get good gear but not break the bank. I've been running on my treadmill 3 days a week for the last month. Doing a 5k program through the Runna app for 8 weeks then going to start running outside (wanted to build my stamina).
I'm looking at Salomon Aero Glide 2 and HOKA Clifton 9 shoes. They're on sale which is one reason they peaked my interest. Would anyone recommend either of these?
I've never bought shoes from either of these brands I do have ON shoes. One I wear for the treadmill and my other pair I wear all the time. I like both but looking for something cushiony. I didn't want to stick to one brand in case there's something better out there that may even be a little cheaper.
I'm ""training"" to be able to run a 5k with minimal, or if the planets align, no stopping.

These shoes would be for running outside only. Idk if it matters but it‚Äôs more of a jog. I‚Äôve never been a fast distance runner, I‚Äôm not doing it to compete just doing it for fun/exercise. And for personal reasons. ",2025-03-25 03:28:25+00:00,0,2
1jj8ysv,XXRunning,Need new shoes?,"I wish there was flair for a dumb question because I'm pretty sure this is one üòÇ Isn't the answer always to buy new shoes? üòê 

I have posterior tibial tendon pain in my ankle intermittently. When I started running in Asics Kayanos, the pain cleared up pretty quick. Recently it's come back and is being really stubborn. 

I only have about 350 miles (I've had them since November but wasn't running quite as many miles in them at first) on the shoes,  but is it possible I already need new ones? That's the only thing I can think of that might have changed/worn down. 

For reference, I currently run about 20-25 miles a week and I think I forefoot strike predominantly but I've never had a gait analysis. I mildly pronate, but heavier stability shoes like the Hoka Gaviottas were terrible and uncomfortable. I have also found that lower drop shoes bug my ankle/posterior tib, which is why (I assume) the Kayanos were kind of a goldilocks. I use Currex low arch insoles, the red ones, and I have a fresh pair of those. ",2025-03-25 02:19:53+00:00,3,11

I have some good supportive sneakers now, finally got in Hokas and Oofas to try (and return one) but they both ...kind of hurt? Is it because I'm not used to it? Is it because I'm still inflamed? Any thoughts welcome! These shoes are really expensive for me (especially after buying the sneakers too) so I'm don't really want to get something if it's gonna make things worse!",2025-03-25 01:12:49+00:00,2,7
1jj4lbr,runninglifestyle,asics novablast 5 ankle pain,"Hi! I‚Äôm only 7 months into my running journey. I just had my second baby 8 months ago. I ended up finding an absolute love for running on my treadmill. I‚Äôm up to 23km runs. I started with my hospital work runners which were the hoka clifton 9‚Äôs (these took months to break in) and then purchased the asics novablast 5 which I absolutely have loved on the treadmill. I just hit 450km with them and not a single issue. I ended up running 10km outside and it was concrete, dirt, and rocks. I didn‚Äôt notice any bad strides or anything to hurt my ankle but noticed ankle pain around 5km. Am I just worrying too much about my shoes or possibly overpronation?!

1jj24aq,trailrunning,Hoka speedgoats vs challenger (or Inov8 Trailfly?),"Hi - first off I‚Äôm a woman, only just starting to get into trail running. Right now for road running I use Brooks Ghost Max 2 as they‚Äôre super cushioned and help prevent  shin splints which I‚Äôm prone to getting (a combination of the Brooks with various exercises has helped with that now)

I‚Äôm in the Uk by the south west coast path and looking to do more trail running spring - early autumn when it‚Äôs not crazy muddy. I usually do have about 1-2km of road ahead of me before getting to the trail so I was considering the Hoka Challengers. But also considering the Hoka Speedgoat and Inov8 Trailflys - so many options and I‚Äôm overwhelmed so would love some help and advice.

Essentially I‚Äôm worried that if I don‚Äôt go for enough cushioning my shin splints will come back and that‚Äôll ruin everything, but if I have too much cushioning I might feel unstable on the trail?",2025-03-24 21:12:43+00:00,0,12

Does any major brand?  Any brand at all, like all those shoes on Amazon I've never heard of (Larnmern, Nortiv, etc). 

If you do know of one that you've had a positive experience, please list it here.  I'm open to brands I've never heard of before.

1jj0fgl,FootFunction,Capsulitis diagnosis,"I was recently diagnosed with capsulitis of the second toe, after an MRI. 
About 5 weeks ago, I suddenly began having pain on the ball of my foot while walking. At first I thought it might be a stress fracture from overuse, but 2 X-rays and an MRI ruled that out. 

Orthopedic foot surgeon explained that this condition could last anywhere from a few weeks to several months.
He explained that eventually the issue will ‚Äúburn itself out‚Äù and heal.
He also offered surgery as another option if the pain doesn‚Äôt improve.
(Shortening the second toe, fusing my big toe and correcting my bunion). 

I have tried resting the foot for 2 weeks now, with no improvement. 
Today, I walked 2.5 miles.  The pain didn‚Äôt get better, but also didn‚Äôt get worse.  

I have toe spreaders, wear HOKA bondi 8‚Äôs, superfeet insoles, and a felt metatarsal pad.  I wear HOKA recovery slides around the house. These don‚Äôt take the pain away. 
During the day, I elevate my foot, sometimes do an epsom salt soak. 
Calf exercises were recommended by the Dr. 

What has helped you, if you have suffered from this painful condition?  ",2025-03-24 20:06:14+00:00,2,6

1jiu9al,RunningShoeGeeks,Mizuno Wave Rebellion Pro 2 aka the Mizuno RebellionFly -Next%. Bonus comparison to Adidas Prime X Strung.,"I know this is a review of some old has been shoes, but maybe someone will find it interesting, given the Wave Rebellion Pro 2's are now on some pretty big clearance sales.

Background:

51M, 5'9"", 174 lbs.  Run about 35 to 55 mpw, depending on season.  Daily running pace is \~ 9 min / miles @ \~ 135 bpm.  Size 10.5 ft width D.  I usually size up to 11 in shoes.

Gear:

I run with a Garmin 645M, Stryd (half the time), Polar chest strap HRM (most of the time).

Current Rotating shoes:

Asics Novablast 3, Superblast 1, Mizuno Wave Sky 7, Nike Vaporfly Next%, Nike AF1, Adidas Prime X Strung.  Most of these shoes are either EOL, or halfway there.  PXS is toast at 800 miles now, but I just swapped in my last brand new pair.

So, now that I'm on the last pair of my favorite shoe of all time (Prime X Strung), I figured I should start looking at other super trainer type shoes.  Some shoes that were up for consideration: Hoka Cielo X1, and the Wave Rebellion Pro 2.  I already tried the Prime X Strung 2 a year ago, and I had to send them back.  They were absolutely horrible.  The Wave Rebellion Pro 2 looked intriguing, and they were on a big sale.  I got them for $134 before tax.  I'm not a big fan of Mizuno, and have another pair of their dailies that I loathe.  Prior to that, the last Mizuno I ran in was over 20 years ago.  But, I was willing to give Mizuno another chance.  I've ran in them these past three days, and put 15 miles on them.  I did back to back testing with these shoes and my last brand new pair of PXS.  Here are some initial thoughts:

1. Fit: I got these in a size 11, and damn, they fit SMALL.  The toe box is really narrow and cramped.  I would return these just because of the size.  Size 11 in the Adidas Prime X Strung is awesome.  I have so much room in the toe box, that my feet swim in it.  If you size up by half for your running shoes, you might want to size up a full size for these.  Especially with the weird geometry of the midsole, my feet keeps sliding into the toe box area more, and my toes feel like they're getting jammed the hell up.
2. Weight: These are some fairly light shoes.  I weighed them at 8.6 oz's.  Surprisingly, there is a pretty big difference in weight between both sides of about 0.25 oz's.  My Adidas PXS weighs a full oz+ more at 9.8 oz.  Also surprising that the PXS also has a difference in weight between both sides of about 0.2 oz's.
3. Midsole: The midsole is honestly magical.  I have the Mizuno Wave Sky 7 that has a big stack height of 41 mm and their new Enerzy midsole.  I absolutely hated that shoe.  I got it because I'm on Amazon Vine, and it was offered to me for free.  I haven't ran in a Mizuno since over 20 years ago, but the new midsole and hype got me excited to run in a Mizuno again.  But, that hype was quickly popped after I ran in the shoe.  The midsole was hard and FIRM, and it was just a heavy, clunky shoe.  Just despise it and can't wait to hit 400 miles so I can toss the shoes. With the Wave Rebellion Pro 2, the midsole feels super bouncy and energetic.  I hate using the term responsive, because to me, that just means FIRM and HARD as hell.  I like midsoles that are BOUNCY (think Nike Invincible Run midsole).  And, the Wave Rebellion Pro 2 BOUNCES like trampolines.  I actually think it's bouncier than the Alphafly and even the Prime X Strung, especially with that weird geometry.
4. Outsole: It's fine, not much else to say about it.
5. Upper: Very thin, breathable, and light.  I love the upper.  It's a synthetic engineered structured fabric that is different than anything else in my rotating shoes.
6. Geometry: Very odd.  The drop isn't the issue, but that significant rocker just makes this shoe really difficult for me to run in.  As a mid foot striker, I end up landing right on the rocker like it's a fulcrum, which makes the trampoline effect more pronounced.  It really feels like you're landing on the tip of a soft triangle.  The triangle compresses and pops you right back up.  This sounds great in theory, but for me, it starts to fatigue my foot arch quickly.  I start to run in a way that actively avoids this, and try to land more on the forefoot.  But, because the geometry of the shoe is so weird in the forefoot (not a lot of drop), the shoe teeters back on that triangle part of the shoe to the heel.  This really fatigues my quads.

First run was a SLOW 5 miler with my wife.  We jogged 10:30 min / miles, and that whole time, I was thinking, ""Damn, these are a slog to run in.""  My legs, calves and quads, felt pretty beat from that jog.  I wasn't sure why.  But, I figured on Sat. I would do a back to back 5 miler with this shoe against my newly opened Prime X Strung.

Second run was this past Sat.  I did the first 5 miles in the Mizunos.  I warmed up one mile, and then ran 2 miles out and 2 miles back.  Timed the distance and checked the average HR.  I did the same run in the Adidas after resting, hydrating, and eating some dry cereal.  Started the 2 miles out and back at the around the same HR as the Mizunos.  The Mizunos felt like a chore to run.  It was fatiguing my legs a bit.  The Adidas were great in comparison.  Legs felt much better, but I think they were fatigued from the Mizunos, so it wasn't the best run.  I ran the distance around the same time, and checked my average HR.  Surprisingly, it was around the same.  So, I figured I would give it another go today and start with the Adidas first.

Yesterday, did the same run.  Warmed up a mile, then ran 2 mile out and back.  Damn, the Adidas felt awesome.  I just started picking up the pace and was down to 7:30 min / miles.  On the way back, I was around 7 to 7:30 min miles as the slight head wind turned to a tail wind.  Legs felt awesome.  Then I hydrated, rested, cooled off (warm day in the upper 70's), and had some dry cereal.  Went back in the Mizunos, and even the 1 mile warm up was a slog.  Doing the next 4 and it was HARD to hit the same time as the Adidas.  My legs felt SO fatigued, I almost wanted to stop and walk for a bit, but I soldered on and finished a bit over the time of the Adidas.  I checked my average HR and it was 157 bpm vs 150 bpm for the Adidas.  It sure felt like it.  I have now christened this shoe as the new NEGATIVE Next%, because it feels like it's sapping energy instead of giving it back.

Conclusion:

These shoes are going back.  I'm returning them, like I did the Adidas Prime X Strung 2's.  It would have been a great shoe, I think, if it wasn't for the weird geometry of the mid sole.  I love the midsole material, and the upper and how light the shoe is, but they need to get rid of that aggressive rocker.  I think the new Wave Rebellion Pro 3 has much better geometry, and I wouldn't mind checking out that shoe sometime.  But, right now, I think I just have to hope that the Prime X Strung 3 re-captures the magic of the OG shoe.

1jiqq9b,CaminoDeSantiago,Tips from the Camino!,"Currently on the Camino Frances (day 6 in los arcos) and thought I‚Äôd share some tips and things I didn‚Äôt know since this sub has been super helpful to me so far.

- 5/6 of the albuergues I‚Äôve been in so far (mostly municipal) make you take your shoes off at the entrance or somewhere before you enter the hostel. I didn‚Äôt know this and had to buy sandals at the Albergue in roncesvalles. I believe it is to prevent smells, so a second pair of shoes to walk around in is not a preference but a requirement unless you‚Äôre ok being barefoot throughout the hostel (probably not recommended)
- Google/apple maps doesn‚Äôt always have the route that you walk on for the Camino so if you‚Äôre following that, you‚Äôre going to make some wrong turns. That also means sometimes time estimates and distances in the app for arrival is wrong. The Buen Camino app is best for checking if you‚Äôre on the right route, although the road is generally pretty well waymarked. 
- Google maps also is frequently wrong about open and close hours of restaurants/cafes, especially in smaller towns, so go in person and check, but be prepared to go hungry if you don‚Äôt buy food at a market or a bigger city in advance. 
- Use the Wise Pilgrim app and google maps for checking hostel reviews. I like wise pilgrim because it also helps you book directly with a hostel through their site on bookings.com or WhatsApp. 
- the Altus atmospheric j30 poncho is NOT water proof, it‚Äôs water resistant. The water will eventually get in, so pack some dry bags for your clothes or be sad like me. 
- I know people say this a lot but I can‚Äôt stress the importance of not getting caught up with keeping up with everyone else; it‚Äôs ok to go at your own pace, your body will thank you for it later.
- Express bourricot right down the street from the pilgrims office in SJPDP can get your luggage stored in Santiago for you. 
- Learn how to use walking sticks correctly, there‚Äôs a specific way to hold the pole with the strap that supports your arms and wrist and makes using it so much more effective. 
- If the forecast says it‚Äôs going to rain at your destination, keep in mind that you‚Äôre not at the destination yet and it might not actually rain where you‚Äôre walking. We were all worried all this past week about the rain but we encountered none until today. 
- My feet actually did swell up A LOT while walking. It‚Äôs actually crazy how grateful I was that I sized up. I didn‚Äôt think it was possible. That being said, I sized up only a half size and I got wide shoes instead of the usual and it‚Äôs been perfect. 


Things I‚Äôm super glad I brought:
- a lifestraw water bottle. Especially that first day and climb into roncesvalles, being able to fill my water bottle up from the river and taps that say ‚Äúuntreated water‚Äù without fear of getting sick was downright liberating. Careful you don‚Äôt catch a little fish in there though! 
- Diaper pins/binder clips to hang my clothes up to dry; don‚Äôt be at the mercy of there being enough clothespins for you to use at albergues. There won‚Äôt be. (I brought binder clips because I just have a million but normal clothes pins will do) 
- A goretex rain hat (which I also use for sun, I sized up so when it's hot I can have some breathing room and otherwise I layer my merino wool buff under the hat and it's perfect) Being able to keep the rain off my face while I walked through the rainstorm today greatly improved the quality of my walk and it‚Äôs not heavy.
- Slip resistant hokas. Self explanatory 
- Merino wool buff
- A hiking pack shoulder strap pocket to put my phone and water bottle so I don‚Äôt have to take my pack off to drink water. 
- Hero clips to hang my stuff in the bathrooms with no hooks.

1jiphbp,hiking,Exploring is fun but....,"I had a ton of fun yesterday. [I took my puppy Honey out for her longest adventure yet.](https://imgur.com/a/RdSqrI7) It was only about 4.5 miles and we did some exploring as I wanted to see if there was a viable route between 2 places. 

We got to the lake in the pictures and honey had a blast! The way back is when the fun began. The trail on google earth I planned to use was actually a pipeline access trail (think powerline trail). It was completely clear, but had several water crossings. The first 1 or 2 were fine, just muddy, I was more worried about honey drinking stagnant muddy water than anything. The last one is where the lesson was learned.

It looked initially like water interspersed with grass and some mud. It was bigger than the other crossing, about 30 feet or so. However, it turned out to be a full blown marsh. I chose what I thought was a good route. Honey did a good job choosing her own route. I'm not sure if I stepped in what I thought was solid ground, or if I slipped off the grass into the mud. My first step I sunk about 8-10 inches, the second step I sunk about 36 inches. I contemplated if I was going to have to leave a shoe, but thankfully that never happened. 

We got to walk the 2 miles back caked in mud up to our knees. I'll attest that the combo of Hoka Speedgoats and Darn Tough socks do a good job preventing blisters and displacing water. 

Next time I'll be bringing a trekking pole for such an occasion, or better yet, staying away from marshes.",2025-03-24 12:29:33+00:00,2,4
1jioqgw,trailrunning,Shoes for hiking in the tropics,"Hi! 

I am planning a trip in South East Asia and I wanted to have recommendations about shoes for backpacking and trekking in the jungle. 
I will be spending ~2 weeks travelling all over Vietnam, where I'll be walking 12-20k steps daily. 
Then, I'm heading to Sumatra, where I will also do a jungle trek (5 days, walking 6-8 hours a day minimum), and continue walking a lot daily. 

Obviously, my shoes will get wet, no matter how waterproof they are, so I thought I would opt for trail runners that would dry quickly. I'm thinking of getting two pairs: one daily driver for extended walks on pavement and easy conditions, and another for more technical terrain and the jungle trek. Best case scenario would be to get a daily driver that can also handle some of the jungle (not too slippery and drying quickly) so I  can swap shoes around if my feet get too wet. 

 I have pretty wide feet (2E if not wider), so I naturally looked into Altra Lone Peak/Timp 5. 
They look great, but I'm a little worried about getting zero drop shoes because I'm not used to this, and I won't have a chance to wear them regularly before the trip. 
Other options I have seen include Brooks Cascadia 17/18, Hoka Supergoat 6 (although some people seem disappointed in the 6th model), Merrell Agility Peak, or Inov-8 trailfly g270. I think the Topo would be too narrow in the midpoint for my feet.

For the daily driver, I was thinking of Hoka Challenger 7 ATR, or New Balance Hierro V9 for example. I'm very open to recommendations! 

Just note that I don't do any running, but I love a good hike and I'd like to be able to use these shoes in other conditions in the future as well. I would exclusively use those shoes for walking/hiking, not for running. 

Is it a good idea to go with the Altra zero drop? Maybe the transition would be easier if I add a heel cap or an additional sole to add a bit of drop? Please let me know what you think. 

I will of course try the shoes before embarking on the trip to make sure they're a good fit, but I'd love a bit of guidance:) 

Thank you so much!

1jil6qh,PlantarFasciitis,Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome,"Back when my PF was giving me significant trouble, I bought myself a half size bigger Hoka Clifton 9s to move the arch up and give more toe room. Felt wonderful, but I did notice more knee pain when standing still. I read somewhere on here that Hokas will bring out knee pain in some. ?  I don't wear them a ton, so decided to give it time. I can't be that unlucky especially after spending the most I have EVER spent on shoes! Home much of the time anyway. Then, I developed Morton's Neuroma and knee pain from wearing dress shoes one evening. Lovely. Foot injection, time, and continued foot exercises. Neuroma only flares if I don't keep up some sort of exercises. I haven't worn dress shoes since. Knee pain ended up being Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome. Significantly more so on the one leg w/ the PF and MN. I am having trouble with the home exercises.  Medicaid won't cover PT. I can maybe get some assistance. My PF no longer hurts at least. Could the Hokas be what is causing the Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome? Curious if the dress shoes are what tipped the scales so to speak. What a mess...üòÇ ",2025-03-24 07:29:22+00:00,4,6

1jig9n5,Hoka,Rocket X2,I usually run in the Mach 6. I decided to try the Rocket X2. I was worried with all the negative reviews of the Cielo X1 2.0. I should get them this week and I‚Äôll take them for a test run. I‚Äôve got a half coming up on April 19 then a marathon on the 27th.

1jidlba,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Similar Fit to Mafate Speed 4/ 1080V14,"Hope everyone is doing great. My primary races are trails but being a busy dad, husband, and professional I get road KMs in early during the week.

I‚Äôm looking for a pair of road shoes that fit similar to the Mafate Speed 4. I‚Äôve tried other HOKAs like the Clifton and bondi but find the arch digs into my flatter feet(Don‚Äôt need stability shoes as I actually have a fairly neutral midfoot/forefoot strike)

I love the mid drop(5-6mm) is my sweet spot.

Currently my daily‚Äôs are 1080v14s but I‚Äôm looking for another shoe with a smidge more energy return. I tried the SC Trainer V3 but me and carbon plates don‚Äôt work well.

I‚Äôm a larger runner 6‚Äô2 190-195 depending on where I‚Äôm at in my training with big feet 14 us(13.5 UK I find shoes that are 14 US and 13.5 UK fit better. I find the UK sizing more consistent.)

I was thinking of trying the ON Cloudmonster Hypers but I‚Äôm open to any suggestions also open to suggestions of other trail shoes you guys like. Finding the Mafates here in Canada in a 14 was a miracle and im happy I did because they are a solid shoe!

Thanks, Matt.",2025-03-23 23:59:04+00:00,3,1
1jicea3,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Racing Shoe Rec,"Hey everybody. I have recently become interested in getting dedicated racing and speed shoes for my upcoming marathon in about 4 weeks. I am not sure exactly where to start, so looking for a rec from here. I currently use ASICS Superblast 2 for long runs, HOKA Skyflows for daily training, and HOKA Cielo X1 for speed and past races but I don‚Äôt really like them. I think they‚Äôre a touch too heavy? 

I am 6‚Äô0‚Äù M size 11.5, primarily a midfoot striker though I relax into heel striking after a two hours of running. Budget is ideally around $200 and I prefer ASICS since I get a nice 25% discount for being in healthcare, but I think some other brands have similar albeit smaller discounts. Thank you!",2025-03-23 23:02:26+00:00,3,2
1jibvlr,RunningShoeGeeks,HOKA Cielo X1 2.0,"

This is my experience with the Cielo X1 2.0.  

Additionally I have the X1 and absolutely love them.    I primarily use them as a long run shoe.    

Rocket X2 has been my race shoe for the last 2 years.   May be my all time favorite racer.   Just got the Cielo 2.0 so it‚Äôs possible to move to #1 for me. 

55 yr old.  5‚Äô10‚Äù 175 lbs.  Midfoot striker. 
Avg 5k =19:15
10k =39-40 min
13.1 = 1:30 
Not a marathoner so this information may not apply if you are.   
Avg 30 miles per week
20+ races per year. 

Used the 2.0 for several threshold runs.   Mile repeats at 6:10 mile.  Have an upcoming 5 miler I will race in them.   

MIDSOLE:
Amazing bounce and energetic ride.   Smooth ride that gets even smoother the faster you go.   It is truly a slimmed down X1 however it feels slightly more energetic and nimble.   Extremely fun and effective.  
Rocker is aggressive.   When you hit your paces the shoe is so smooth.  

FIT:  
Fit is TTS for me compared to my  X1 and Rocket X2.    
No gaps or puckering in fabric. Ample toe room and width.   Foot is secure however no hot spots.  
I like the solid heel counter.   Foot is held in place and I don‚Äôt even notice the heel.  
The laces are not saw tooth however I‚Äôm pleased with them.  No slippage at all.  
Tongue stays in place and is a good length.   It is not gusseted however it does a great job of staying in place.  

STABILITY:   
The heel is very soft so just walking or standing feels like a negative drop sometimes.  
I think that is also due to the cutout in the heel to eliminate weight.  
I have zero stability issues during the run.   I am a midfoot striker and this shoe is stable as long as you do not heel strike.   I‚Äôve had some turns and direction changes during my threshold runs and I was not concerned about stability.  

A lot of influencer comments about lack of stability however you should try it for yourself and make your own decision.   

I don‚Äôt have any concerns or issues with this shoe.  

Overall I‚Äôm very pleased with the x2.0 and like it better than expected.   I have experience with Alphafly 1, Vaporfly 2 & 3, ASICS Sky and Endorphin Pro 3.  

Everyone is different and respond differently to shoes.   I hope my experience helps someone if they are interested in the X 2.0.   Lots of great choices available and an amazing time to be a runner.  ",2025-03-23 22:39:31+00:00,201,36

1ji5elh,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Road shoe for 200 miler on crushed limestone?,"I am normally a trail runner and run in Hoka Speedgoats on trails and Brooks Ghost on roads. I‚Äôm happy with both but I have a fall flat 200 miler on primarily crushed limestone where I will be completing the race with plenty of run/walk and would prefer to wear a bit more cushioned road shoe than the ghost. My dilemma is I don‚Äôt seem to care much for max cushioned shoes. Those tend to give me plantar faciitis symptoms or make me feel like I am wearing clown shoes. So far I have tried and rejected some max cushioned shoes, including Asics Superblast and Novablast, and Hoka Skyward X. I kind of like Adidas Evo SL, but I despise the tongue and the shoe feels a bit sloppy on me (especially the heel slips). I think it will be decent later in the race when my feet swell though. I also did not care for Mount to Coast shoes or Hoka Clifton based on those having uncomfortable arch support. Brooks Glycerine and New Balance More tend to blister me. So, my search continues.

1ji4kis,beginnerrunning,Nothing solving ankle pain,"Got into running a few months ago. Hit up multiple running stores because I was experiencing some ankle pain. Started with NB 1080s, store gave me currex med profile inserts because something about my arches. Helped a little, but decided something was still off and I needed more support than the NBs were giving me. Next running store put me in the opposite direction, some very high support hoka arahis. Felt good at the store but immediately felt sharp pain when running in those. Doubled back and gave me the middle of the road option asics gt 2000-13. 

Nothings worked, Ive also tried the inserts in each, but Ive decided the asics hurt me the least. Tried long bouts of recovery, didn‚Äôt work. Longer warm ups help a little. Working on my form, shorter strides help but tire me quickly and feel awkward. Im a weightlifter and have solid one leg stability and strength. I jog up the stair master and have solid cardio. On a good day I was able to get a 24:12 5k on the treadmill. On a normal day, I can barely get over a mile w/o stopping. Every run hurts, a lot, runs outside hurt more. Ive begun a masochistic attempt at running through it every day in hopes of adapting. Still very painful, but Im perhaps recovering a little quicker now? Considering a brace, but I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs sort of a crutch. Could a coach or real doctor be worth it in my situation?

Anyone gone through anything like this or have any suggestions?

Read some posts on here from a couple of years ago and lots of people mention Altras, after visiting the site noticed a lot of average reviews so not sure these are still the ones to go with.

I'm leaning towards hiking shoes because the waterproof factor, plus more cushion for comfort. We will primarily be in Edinburgh, Inverness, and Glasgow, and we will be walking a lot so I want the extra cushion for comfort. My wife and I would like to do a short hike or two while we're over there, so that plus rain is where the waterproof comes in. 

I'm only planning on bringing these and a nice-er pair of leather boots bc I would like to go to a nice dinner while we're there.

I went to the shop earlier and looked at the Hoka Transport, Altra Timp 5s and a few others. Do yall have any experience with these? Any you'd recommend?

1jhooo6,RunningShoeGeeks,Topo Magnifly 300-400 mile review,"So a little backstory. I came off of Hoka Cliftons. Hoka has served me well, meaning I was getting a lot less knee and hip pains but my toe pain just kept getting worse and worse. It was getting to the point to where I had thought about going to the doctor. I have ran 2 marathons in Hoka shoes, but I was thinking I needed something different. I have known for a while that I have high arches and wide feet for a while now, and Hoka just doesnt offer a lot of toe space to accomodate my feet. After some review, I decided to try a shoe with a wide toe box. I also wanted to try a zero drop shoe, because going from a 12mm drop to a 5mm drop made my knee and hip pains go away almost completely. This limited my options to Topo or Altra.

Reviewing Topo vs Altra shoes at the store revealed to me a few things. Altra is the better known brand and has the most reviews. Topo is kind of the lesser known little brother. Although Topo doesn't have as many reviews, it was pretty obvious to me that they made their shoes out of better quality material. Altra seemed to make their shoes out of plastic. They felt almost polyester like. My feet were sliding in them when I had them fully laced up. I determined this might be a problem on long runs as it may produce blisters.

Topo on the other hand seemed to make their shoes out of a felt or maybe cotton. They 'gripped' on to my feet a little better and felt like they weren't as cheaply made like you would imagine a plastic shoe. Topo in general fit my wide feet and high arches like a glove. It 'gripped' on to my heels, supported my arches, and allowed plenty of wiggle room for my toes. This made my decision to go to Topo. I decided to go with the magnify for the zero-drop option although the phantoms with their 4mm drop seemed to be more cushioned. This would be one of my only complaints as time went on.

My first few runs I had some knee discomfort and some Achilles discomfort. Although I contribute that to adaptation to a zero drop shoe. As the weeks passed on, that pain soon went away. My toe pain also got much much better as well with the roomy toe box these shoes provide. For reference, I have been using these as my only running shoe and putting in 30-40 mile weeks.

I have been wearing them not only on my runs but also at work. They are holding up alright. The tread is starting to wear down though, but to be expected with the miles I put on them.

My complaints with this shoe is that I wish I had gotten a size slightly larger or possibly in wide. Although my toe pain is better, I still could use a little more room on the edges of the shoe. Topo seems to size their shoes smaller than what's advertised. My other complaint is that there is not enough cushion. It is marketed as a 'medium' cushioned shoe but imo it could easily pass as a 'low' cushioned shoe. My feet hurt on long runs, something I hadn't seen with wearing my Hokas.

Overall, I would give this shoe a 9/10 score. It is a good quality shoe but fits smaller than advertised and is a little less cushioned than advertised. My next shoe is definitely going to be with Topo, and I'm eyeing the Phantoms. I'm not completely sold on zero drop and those Phantoms do seem to have better cushioning.",2025-03-23 02:00:30+00:00,42,7
1jhnpnm,beginnerrunning,Need advice on my running,"27F, Okay so I ran track in high school and didn‚Äôt have any issues. Towards my senior year I had some hip trouble but really nothing major.

## Understanding the Core Differences

At their most basic, hiking boots are designed for stability, support, and protection on challenging terrain, while trail runners prioritize agility, speed, and a lightweight feel. However, the line between them is increasingly blurred. Modern hiking shoes frequently enough resemble low-cut hiking boots,and some trail running shoes incorporate features traditionally found in hiking footwear. Understanding the key distinctions in features and performance will help you steer clear of discomfort.

### Key Distinctions in Features and Performance of Hiking Boots and Trail Runners - An in-depth look

* **Ankle Support:** Hiking boots,notably mid- or high-cut models,offer superior ankle support. This is crucial for backpacking with heavy loads, traversing uneven terrain, or if you have a history of ankle injuries. Trail runners, with their lower profile, provide minimal ankle support, allowing for greater freedom of movement.

* **Waterproof vs. Breathable:** Waterproof hiking boots are ideal for wet conditions, keeping your feet dry and warm. However, waterproof membranes can reduce breathability, potentially leading to sweaty feet in warmer weather. Trail running shoes often prioritize breathability over waterproofing, making them more comfortable in dry conditions but less suitable for prolonged exposure to rain or stream crossings. Some trail running shoes offer waterproof variations but often prioritize breathability.

* **Grip and Traction:** Both hiking boots and trail runners feature aggressive outsoles designed for gripping various surfaces. The lug pattern, depth, and rubber compound influence traction. hiking boots typically have deeper, more aggressive lugs for superior grip on loose dirt, mud, and rocks. Trail runners frequently enough utilize a more versatile lug pattern designed for a balance of grip and speed on groomed trails and less technical terrain. The outsole material also plays an important role in grip and durability.

* **Stability and Protection:** Hiking boots offer greater stability due to their stiffer construction and wider platform,making them suitable for carrying heavy loads and navigating challenging terrain. They also provide enhanced protection against rocks, roots, and other hazards. Trail runners are more flexible and offer less protection, making them ideal for moving quickly over smoother trails. Features such as a rock plate will protect against sharp objects underfoot.

* **Cushioning and Comfort:** Cushioning is key for comfort, especially on long hikes. Trail runners tend to have more cushioning than conventional hiking boots, providing a more comfortable ride on hard-packed trails. Though, some modern hiking boots now incorporate advanced cushioning technologies for enhanced comfort.

* **Weight:** Weight is a critical factor, particularly for long-distance hiking and trail running. Trail runners are considerably lighter than hiking boots, reducing fatigue and allowing you to move faster. Lighter hiking boots are becoming more common, but they generally still weigh more than trail runners.* **Durability:** Hiking boots are generally more durable than trail runners, designed to withstand the rigors of demanding terrain and heavy use. Trail runners, while becoming increasingly durable, are more susceptible to wear and tear, especially when used on rocky or abrasive surfaces.

## Decoding Your Hiking Style and Needs

Before diving into specific brands and models; consider your typical use cases and activities.### Use Cases & Activities: Matching Footwear to Your Adventures

* **Day Hiking:** For shorter day hikes on well-maintained trails, both hiking boots and trail runners can be suitable. If you prefer a lightweight and agile feel,trail runners are a great option. If you need more ankle support or protection, or are carrying a heavier pack, hiking boots might potentially be a better choice.

* **Backpacking:** Backpacking with a heavy load generally requires the stability and support of hiking boots. Look for models with a stiff midsole and ample ankle support.While fastpacking is an option that employs trail runners, the load must be considered carefully.

* **Trail Running:** Trail running demands the lightweight agility of trail runners. Look for models with good cushioning,traction,and breathability.

* **long Distance Hiking:** For long-distance hikes like the Appalachian Trail or the Pacific Crest Trail, the choice between hiking boots and trail runners is a personal one. Many thru-hikers now prefer trail runners for their lightweight comfort, but others still prefer the support and durability of hiking boots. Durability becomes an even greater consideration with longer distance hikes.

* **Mountain Hiking:** Mountain hiking often involves steep ascents, rocky terrain, and unpredictable weather. hiking boots with excellent ankle support, traction, and waterproofing are generally recommended.

* **Rocky Terrain & Muddy Trails:** Hiking boots excel on rocky terrain, providing protection and stability. For muddy trails,waterproof hiking boots with aggressive lugs offer superior traction.

* **Groomed Trails & Uneven Terrain:** Trail runners are well-suited for groomed trails, offering a comfortable and efficient ride.For uneven terrain, hiking boots provide greater stability and protection.

* **Scrambling:** Scrambling,or climbing over rocks,requires footwear with excellent grip and stability. Hiking boots with a stiff sole and good edging capabilities are generally preferred. Approach shoes are also a viable choice, bridging the gap between hiking boots and climbing shoes.

* **Fastpacking:** Fastpacking, which combines hiking and trail running, demands lightweight footwear that can handle a variety of terrain. Trail runners are the preferred choice for fastpacking, but it is important to factor in the load that the runner will be carrying and choosing a more reinforced trail runner if needed.

1jgtzql,sesamoid,Success Story & Full Recovery!!,"**Sesamoid Stress Fracture Recovery! Full return to rock climbing, backpacking, skiing, etc.**

Hey all, I've wanted to come back here and post for a long time after being in a pit of despair when first finding this page.

I developed a Stress Fracture in the sesamoid on my **left** foot while I was healing from a plantar plate tear in my right foot under my second toe in May 2022. I believe it formed from heavily overcompensating, stress from rock climbing shoes, then significant overcompensation while in a walking boot for the injury on my **right** foot.

I walked on the stress fracture for 3 months before finally getting diagnosed. Yikes! My doctor (having worked with other climbers, who is a Foot & Ankle Surgeon) had me IMMEDIATELY go non-weight bearing for 2 months in August 2022. Instead of a boot, he had me wear this splint that is normally used for bunions. He told me to just wear this without tightening the splint, but using it to prevent motion in the big toe joint. I was strict non weight bearing, but was able to move around my ankle, and also lean on my heel, but otherwise I was on crutches and a knee scooter. The splint is weird and if you're cold, you will def want toe socks or to wear a sock over the splint.

At the end of 2 months, I started very minimal weight bearing in a supportive shoe with an orthotic, a WIDE toe box, and a stiff, rocker bottom. I believe a lot of my problems were caused by Hokas because of the narrow toe box, and I do NOT recommend Hokas! I wore the Altra Olympus Shoes and the Altra Paradigm for everything and I think having a wide toe splay is CRITICAL for overall foot health. I also used the gel dancers pads constantly.

In October 2022, 10 days after being back to walking, I reflared the injury because I went out dancing in Mexico. Bad call, take your healing seriously!! I had to go back on the knee scooter for 2 months with the splint, then finally started walking again. Its now (basically) beginning of January 2023 and I'm back to slowly weight bearing. I consulted with a PT friend and started doing light movement/stretching exercises, and waited 6 weeks to start actual physical therapy. During these first 6 weeks back to walking, I used my knee scooter whenever I had to walk more than 2 minutes. I took it SUPER slow.

To stay sane during all this, I used Caroline Jordan's Hurt Foot Fitness workouts. She is so encouraging and helped me stay sane - her workouts are on youtube and she also had a sesamoid injury! [https://www.youtube.com/@CarolineJordan](https://www.youtube.com/@CarolineJordan)

I was so mentally destroyed when I started seeing my Physical Therapist in person in mid February 2023. However, he spent so much time coaching me on the fact that the injury had already HEALED and that so much of my reactions and pain were from my brain being freaked TF out. I swear half our sessions were him coaching me that pain was normal and was going to ebb and flow, but he also helped me get out of the never ending loop of PANIC any time I would do too much and have pain. I stayed in Physical Therapy for an entire year (I was only going 1x per week initially, then it was 1-2x a month) and I can say that I have made a full return to EVERYTHING. I rock climb, ski, hike long distances, backpack, and so much more. I can lift, carry objects, finally do lunges, and I even started wearing heels again for very special occasions (not going to press my luck with that). So much of this recovery was mental and I hope you can find a PT that addresses that very important element of a traumatic injury.

Furthermore, if you can get access to peptides like BPC-157 as a subQ injection, that has helped me immensely with the sesamoiditis and overall healing in ligaments and joints. Its not going to do much for bones but it can't help! I also got all of these injuries while I was not eating much protein and was over exercising. I eat way more meat now and my body has responded really positively. I also supplemented during this time with Vitamin D, Calcium, Magnesium, Hyaluronic Acid, and Amino Acids. I eat pretty clean (mostly) and I know this all plays a role in inflammation.

  
That being said, this time during my life was absolutely brutal, and the pain messed with me SO much. I'm so sorry you're going through this but you can and will absolutely heal. Addressing the mental component of pain in your body is so critical - I have 100% certainty that I wouldn't be where I am right now if I hadn't learned about this part of the process. Also, keep having fun while you're healing! I went to raves on my knee scooter, was in a wedding on my knee scooter, and decorated the shit out of that thing. Lights and glowy objects on the scooter are essential! You've got this! ",2025-03-21 22:55:04+00:00,29,11

Just got new brooks adrenaline gts 24 (I have flat feet and over pronation) and I get arch pain after walking for about 0.10 of a mile. The shoes aren't too tight and they don't feel too narrow. Does this happen to anyone else? Do my shoes just need to break in?

1jgkaz6,walking,Self Improvement - Day 1,"I am a 22 year old male that weighs 160kg/350lbs at height of 185cm/6'1ft. After sitting at home for the past year with barely any activity in my life, I've decided to start my journey of weight loss. Today marks a full week since i have started eating a healthy 1,500 calorie daily plan, taken out all the sodas and other sugary beverages, stopped eating snacks. On top of that, I have just taken my very first walk of this journey and it feels amazing.

  
So far the walking experience is not the greatest, as i've earned myself a blister on both of my feet, which made me realize that my shoes are actually not the right size, oh well. The shoe in question is Asics Gel-Venture 9 that i've had for a year now so probably would have happened even if they were the perfect size. I am using Darn Tough midweight hiking socks and my feet stayed dry the whole time but my foot kept moving inside of my shoe a tiny bit back and forth, causing friction and ball of my foot started burning a lot, resulting in those blisters. For tomorrow's walk I will try to stuff my shoes with newspapers or something to ensure my feet stay in place and hopefully offer a temporary fix for that problem until i decide on which shoes to get, been debating between Brooks Glycerin 22/Max, Asics Nimbus 25/Novablast 5 and Hoka Bondi 9, we'll see.

  
If anyone has tips on pre-, during and post-long walk routines, I am more than happy to take some advice as I am very unsure in what I'm doing at the moment. Appreciate everyone's advice in advance! <3

1jg91zq,Hoka,Recommendations for UPS,"Hello,

About a year ago, I bought my Dad his first pair of Hoka (Clifton 8). He works for UPS in an industrial sector and does many miles on his feet each day, while carrying boxes. 

He loved the shoes, but joked that they'll last about 6 weeks. He was slightly off, but not by much. They lasted him 9 weeks before becoming worn to the point where his balance was affected. 

Fast forward to now, and he's gone through 2 pairs of Cliftons and 2 pairs of Kawanas in less than a year. 

He loves the shoes and the support they provide when newer, but really needs something more durable. Are there any models of Hoka that can withstand the conditions that he puts them through? 

Price is not an issue, because I want to reduce the pain he feels in his feet, knees, and hips. Once the shoe starts to deteriorate, his pain returns gradually until it's time for a new pair. 

Please provide me with recommendations if there are Hokas that seem to fit his needs! I'm not sure if I'll have to switch brands, or continue the constant purchase cycle. 

Thank you! I appreciate your time!

UPDATE: The Bondi 9's I ordered for him were delivered April 24th. Let's see how long they last",2025-03-21 04:50:21+00:00,3,7
1jg8zol,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Most stable carbon plated shoe between these three ? (Or maybe another one?),"Hey everyone!

Lately, I‚Äôve been experiencing some issues with my soleus, likely due to a lack of stability in my ankles (overpronation) when doing tempo runs and intervals (so, higher speeds) with my Adios Pro 3.

I went to a running store and tried the New Balance SC Trainer V3, and I really liked them. They felt way more stable than my Adios Pro 3, with a bit more comfort. Maybe slightly less energy return, but that‚Äôs not a big deal for me.

I also tested the Saucony Endorphin Speed 4, which was definitely the most stable, but I didn‚Äôt like how low to the ground they felt. They also seemed a bit firm and lacked energy return.

I kept researching, and right now, I‚Äôm hesitating between the SC Trainer V3 (since the V4 is coming in July/August, and I don‚Äôt want to wait), the Adidas Prime X 2 Strung, and the Hoka Cielo X1 (1.0).

For my specific case, which one would you recommend among these three? 

Thanks in advance!

1jg5xji,AskRunningShoeGeeks,"Running shoe advice request : novice runner, 225 lbs supinator, forefoot runner","Hey everyone.. not new to running but definitely not an expert in different shoes.  I'm 6'3, 225 lbs running anywhere between 12-20 miles a week mostly treadmill (until it warms up).  I run almost exclusively on my forefoot because of various studies on knee and ankle impact (I'm sure you're all aware).  I've been changing shoes out every 6 months, and mostly using Nike Pegasus models.  They're good.. simple.  Tried Brooks ghost, second favorite, tried a Hoka Clifton and it was horrible for running great for walking, and Saucony... Something.  

I'd love any recommendations for a neutral daily trainer, with lots of cushioning and maybe some recommendations of low cushioning.  I don't LOVE the platform running shoes but I realize I'm heavy and might just have to put up with running on pillows if that's what you all recommend.

Any help is greatly appreciated, I love that there's a sub for this :)",2025-03-21 01:56:10+00:00,2,3

1jg1hbn,trailrunning,Durable wide trail shoes similar to altras?,"I‚Äôm looking for a durable wide toe box trail shoe. I‚Äôm currently using a pair of Altra lone peak all weather Mids. I found the OGs in my size back in june and I love them. The zero drop is great, i feel good ground connection with just enough cushion that i can use them every day. The only problem is i haven‚Äôt even had them a year and they‚Äôre basically kaput. Pretty big holes in the side and the tread is wearing fast. I live in Alaska so the trails here can be pretty brutal at times, there‚Äôs a good bit of stream crossings as well so I‚Äôve enjoyed having the Mids, but it‚Äôs not a deal breaker. 

Anyone have any recommendations?
I'd like to have:
Zero drop
Good water proofing
Great durability
Slight cushion for rock protection

My roster so far is
Brooks cascades
Vivo magma lite
Solomon x ultra 360
Norda 001
A yearly pair of altras

Im afraid of the vivos being too low cushion for where I'm at but it's the only ones that have the wide toe box I'm looking for. Solomon makes great shoes for the durability but i feel they're usually too narrow with a huge heel. I don't want too much cushion because i really enjoy still being able to feel the ground so I'm ruling out hokas. I know this is a lot to navigate through but I'll take any advice yall can give. I'm just about pulling my hair out trying to find a pair so i really appreciate the help. If you made it this far thanks so much for reading!!

A back injury from my job in architecture had me in Birkenstock clogs for years, recommended by a hospital treating me. My feet have been aching for years, walking over 10,000 steps a day in NYC. I don't like the look of sneakers and never considered them as an option, but couldn't take the chronic foot pain anymore. HOKA was recommended as the best sneaker for the feet and I decided to head to two HOKA stores to buy a pair. I first bought the Bondi 9 and they felt like clouds. Never experienced a more incredible feeling on my feet in my life. I hated how they looked though since I only wear dresses and skirts, and ended up exchanging them for the Ora Primos because they were weird enough for me to find stylish. While they do not feel like clouds the way the the Bondis did, they have completely obliterated my foot pain. Walking for hours doesn't hurt anymore, and the pain on top and bottom are completely gone. It's unreal. I do have to say for 99 percent of folks who like sneaker looks, there is nothing like the feeling of the Bondi 9's. I'm going to go get a pair, but right now the Ora Primos are doing it for me. Hard to get on without a struggle, but once they are one they feel great! I'll never buy anything but HOKA's moving forward except for the rare fancy event where I need a dress shoe.

1jfx7j5,Hoka,They changed Bondi 8‚Äôs,"I started a job about 6 months ago where I‚Äôm on my feet all day on slab concrete. I had running shoes at the time and my feet BURNED half way through a shift

Looked into what would be most comfortable and got a pair of Bondi 8‚Äôs. It was like magic. They were bouncy on the heel, almost felt like they had too much arch support, like I could feel it pushing on my arch, but I got used to it by the end of the first shift and boom, zero foot pain.

For MONTHS I was totally pain free. My feet got tired but zero pain.

It‚Äôs been almost a full six months since I got that pair and my feet were hurting again. Doing 10 miles a day in them wore them out fast. That‚Äôs to be expected.

So I hunted for another pair, which is a pain in the ass to get them in my size. Finally found them, paid out the ass again.

Just finished a shift in them and my feet hurt worse than they did in the wore out ones. On top of the normal burn on the heel, there‚Äôs shooting pain down the middle inside of my feet, if you‚Äôve ever had your feet start to flatten from poor arch support, that‚Äôs the feeling I‚Äôm talking about.

In the last six months, something changed. All the support is gone, the inside sole is HARD, no bounce at all, I‚Äôm furious because they‚Äôre expensive and it‚Äôs literally the same shoe I just got, but a totally different experience.

Anyone know exactly what happened? I know a fiscal year for the company probably elapsed in that time, so my guess is that they changed something about the materials or maybe their production process.

Yesterday I would have sworn by Hoka on my life, today, I‚Äôd tell people to avoid them like the plague.",2025-03-20 19:25:30+00:00,0,5
1jfvssz,AskRunningShoeGeeks,"Ghost Max, Tempus, And?","Hello! I'm looking for recs on adding a 3rd shoe to my rotation. Some info - I have a cycling background and have trained 10-15 hours per week the last 4 years. I also ran cross country 10 years ago and cross train with running a bit during the cycling off season. I decided to give marathon training a shot this year. I was aware of people making this transition getting injured due to having the aerobic base to go way faster than what your tendons are coniditoned for, leading to injury. I ramped from 10 mpw in September to 40 mpw in February running 3-5 times per week and subbing cycling and weight lifting on non running days. My lofty goal was to run a 2:55. Threshold pace is 6:00min/mile, tempo 6:40, long 8:00-9:00.

I have 400 miles on the Novablast 4. This shoe slowly aggrivated my tibial tendon over 5 months without me knowing that's what it was. It was set off to full injury from Hoka Mach X2 in my right ankle, and it evetually radiated to the left. Maybe too unstable, maybe first run back from rest week, maybe just overuse, or was it the shoes?

I have been diagnosed by a PT/Ortho that I do have tibial tendonopathy. The last 6 weeks have been spent doing PT, strength work, and cycling. This is the first week I have had no pain, and I am hopeful I am getting better. I have done a few 1 mile runs in the ghost max, but am fully backed off of running for 2 more weeks as directed. I picked up the Tempus on sale at REI for $80, and haven't tried it yet.

Given I have a credit at the store I can return the Mach x2 to, I'm looking for one more shoe. I have tried the superblast, but like the novablast my right big toe rides onto the inside of the upper. I did ty the glycerin max in store and liked it. I am also curious to try the ES4. Thoughts?

  
I may be putting the cart in front of the horse here, but when I got hurt I was starting to become obsessed with the shoes and the respective subreddits, which is why I am asking. Thank you!",2025-03-20 18:27:18+00:00,1,4
1jfuw2x,AskRunningShoeGeeks,"I have seen a Dr, podiatrist, and PT, but I'm still totally confused as to what type of shoe I should be using? Everything I try causes different injuries. (Am not a new runner)","

I have a long history of runner's knee, insertional Achilles tendonitis, and plantar fasciitis. I'm told I have extremely high arches, low heel bones, and very narrow feet. My right leg is a bit wonky- the knee is higher and angled in a bit, while the foot angles out. I often feel that my foot tilts inward while off the ground running and then I am landing on the outer edge of my forefoot. I've been told totally different things on whether I over or under pronate. A lot of shoes, especially soft high cushion shoes, feel unlevel like I am sliding to the outer edge of the shoe. They feel a bit more level without the added insoles but the insoles majorly help my plantar fasciitis and Achilles tendonitis. I was in tons of pain just standing or walking without them for a solid year or so. But I am wondering if they might be messing up the angle of my foot by tilting it. I've tried a ton of shoes and tons of PT as well as a podiatrist and I'm still feeling totally clueless. 

For the last couple years I've been running in Hokas (challenger, torrent, and mach, all with superfeet high arch run insoles), but was always running into knee injuries. The insertional Achilles on my right foot is pretty much always sore too but it's the knee pain that ends up really limiting my running. I thought I'd try out a Brooks shoe with a higher drop but it started killing my heels immediately. So then I tried the North face vectiv enduris for the cushy rocker instead of the high drop, and at first I LOVED them, my insertional Achilles pain vanished and my knees and stride felt good, but after about 5 or 6 miles I suddenly developed a debilitating Achilles pain higher up on the ankle on the opposite leg, and on the next run I injured my posterior tibialis on my good leg too.

I'm so frustrated, I feel like I've tried every type of shoe but have learned nothing and still have no clue what I need as far as cushion, stability, heel drop, rocker. Should I try something different, try Hokas again, try different insoles? Am I not giving myself enough time to adapt to new shoes that are too different? Doctors/physical therapists have given me totally conflicting advice so I'm at a loss. ",2025-03-20 17:49:56+00:00,1,16

1jf3exa,AskRunningShoeGeeks,"Shoes for a teen learning to sprint properly, but doing so on asphalt and grass?","My kids are in their second year of track, and they both really love it. Seems like they‚Äôre going to be doing more sprinting this season. Their school does not actually have a track‚Äîthey practice on asphalt or grass. All of their meets are at schools who do have a track. 

One of my kids is incredibly fast in soccer, and can maintain the same speed as his sibling there, but seems to be having difficulty translating that to track. When I watched him sprinting back and forth in front of our house the other day, I noticed that he‚Äôs landing on his heels. I‚Äôm not an expert in running, by any stretch of the imagination, but I thought he was supposed to be more on his forefoot for sprints.

I‚Äôd like to get him shoes that kind of force him more onto his forefoot‚ÄîI think, if that will help‚Äîbut I don‚Äôt know what shoes to look at, because I know he can‚Äôt run in any traditional sprinting spikes on asphalt. I‚Äôd also like to get a similar pair for his sibling for practice, although he doesn‚Äôt seem to land on his heels when he‚Äôs doing the same back & forth sprint practices in front of the house. 

I bought a pair of the antepes muscle trainer shoes, secondhand, online, for $60-something. But I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs all a gimmick, if they‚Äôll actually help at all, or if they‚Äôre better off sitting in the box they‚Äôll be arriving in. Any recommendations as far as shoes or exercises we could do to help him are greatly appreciated. 

I‚Äôm not one of those screaming sports parents, btw. He‚Äôs always loved running. He‚Äôs been doing 5ks and whatnot for fun for years. He wants to do shorter races in track this year, though, bc he‚Äôs small, and the kids who seemed to do better in distance last year were all a foot or so taller than him.

We‚Äôre also in FL, track season is late spring, and the humidity and heat with his asthma make distance races difficult at that time of year.

He‚Äôs a sweet, gentle kid, who struggles socially, and he wants so much to do well in track. I feel like the potential is there, if we can just get his form corrected, or get the speed he has in other sports to transfer to track. And I know he needs different shoes to practice with.

He currently has NB Fresh Foam 880s, Brooks Glycerin GTS, and Hoka Arahi 7s. Has pronation issues, flat feet, but didn‚Äôt qualify for orthotics.

I have also looked online for tracks that may be open to the public or students within two hours of our house. Absolutely none exist. And the schools will not let you on them after hours, even if you‚Äôre one of the kids who‚Äôs unfortunate enough to attend a school without an actual track but be on the track team. I‚Äôm an approved upper level volunteer for our district, too‚Äîbackground checked and fingerprinted and all, but it doesn‚Äôt matter. I even spent a few days investigating a few locations that were posted on different sites, even though the posts were older, and had zero luck.

1jf250j,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Nike pegasus plus,"Hi everyone,

I found this sub when looking to see if there is a break-in period with running shoes. I just bought the Nike Pegasus Plus because I read good reviews about it and started training for a half marathon.

I have gone on two runs with these shoes, with one of the runs being a treadmill run and the second an interval run on the track. During these runs, I had some discomfort on the bottom of my feet that went away after a while, and I also felt some ankle stiffness, which felt better when I loosened up my shoelace. About an hour after the track run, my knee and ankle felt achy ( Granted, this was the most challenging run I have done this year)

Disclaimer: Before this shoe, I was using the Hoka Mach 6, which, when I would do outdoor runs, I would feel similar pain, but when on the treadmill, I felt fine. I am currently overweight and out of shape.

My question: Do my issues with my running shoes have more to do with me being out of shape, or should I be searching for a new shoe?",2025-03-19 17:12:39+00:00,3,3
1jf0txs,hiking,Supportive Summer Hiking Boot,"Hey r/hiking !

Avid hiker here but struggling to find a supportive non-waterproof breathable hiking boot that meets my needs. During Fall and winter I typically hike in a pair of Hoka Kaha 1 and 2 boots and absolutely love them. I typically hike 2-10km at a time and they've been pain free, fit my custom orthotics, and provide a ton of support and protection.

  
Over the past two summers I tried the Hoka Anacapa Breeze and absolutely hated them. I found they lacked rigidity and support, insoles wobbled so much I took em out, and they aggravated my foot and leg pain because of that. They also wore out extremely quick, within 2 months of daily hiking, the sole is clearly heavily worn and the midsole was smushed to nothing. I do weigh 230-260lbs depending where I am on a cut/bulk cycle.

Requirements:

* Firm and supportive sole
* Fits insoles well
* Wide toe box
* As breathable as possible (no waterproofing needed)

1jf0f0p,trailrunning,Need help choosing between trail shoes!,"Hello everyone! Need some advice from seasoned trail runners on which shoes to buy.

Planning to run 100km the Dolomites in September. Will be over 5 days with some friends, so about 20km a day split up.

Bit of context: I'm a 29YO male, currently run anywhere from 40-70km a week, all road. In the past I've had issues with shin splints, but it's always from running too fast (anterior pelvic tilt). Nowadays I tend to only run between 5-6 minute pace, I like to go slower and longer. Always split into 2 x 20km+ efforts then a few 10km easy recovery runs.

I previously had the HOKA clifton 8s and 9s which is where I got my shin splints after running longer and faster. A physio recommended I try to run on my toes, so I did a bunch of research on shoes to buy that encouraged that (while catering for the kms I'm running). I bought the adidas Boston 12 and On Cloudeclipse. I use the adidas for longer runs and the On's for recovery because they're softer. I love them both dearly for different reasons, already on my second pair of bostons.

SO, the trail run. Now I'm looking to get a specific trail shoe for the trip (and more in the future). I effectively want the Boston 12 of trail shoes - something that keeps me on my toes, feels bouncy but also soft enough that it doesn't give me shin splints.

I've been recommended two shoes. The first is the¬†**adidas Terrex Agravic Speed Ultra.**¬†The second is the¬†**HOKA Speedgoat 6.**

Can anyone here tell me which one is best for me given the above? And does anyone have any other recommendations? Also, not worried about $$ on this purchase .

Anymore advice / info on those two shoes is very very welcome also.",2025-03-19 16:01:08+00:00,1,3

1jeozie,FootFunction,Foot ‚Äúmystery‚Äù,"Female, early 30s

I‚Äôve been having left heel and arch pain for over three months. I‚Äôm still on crutches and can‚Äôt walk much‚Äîeven getting around my small apartment is really hard. My podiatrist and orthopedic surgeon have both said I‚Äôm a ‚Äúmystery.‚Äù My foot is very sensitive and I have to wear very cushioned shoes (hoka bondi 9) with added gel insoles at literally all times to tolerate any amount of weight bearing. Hard surfaces are the worst‚Äînot bearable.

It started in December. My heel/arch hurt the day after a long walk (which was normal for me at the time, though I did wear bad shoes). I went to a walk-in on a few occasions and was told it was plantar fasciitis. I was told to walk less but with intention and focus on icing/stretching. I continued to walk on it carefully and the pain got worse and worse both throughout each day and as time went on. The pain got to be so bad that I ordered a knee scooter to get around on. I saw a doctor again who ordered an ultrasound and X-ray. I then ended up going to the ER with severe foot pain, swelling, discoloration, and coldness. They did an x-ray (normal), CT (normal), Doppler (normal), and ordered an MRI.

Ultrasound results: Plantar fascia: Mildly thickened at 4 mm. Small spur is seen.
Other: In the area of clinical concern in the left heel there is thickening of the soft tissues of the left

MRI results: Edema within the pre-Achilles fat pad/Kager's fat pad. Patchy subcutaneous edema within the subcutaneous tissue of the heel pad. This is in keeping with heel pad fat syndrome and could be the etiology of the patient. No findings to suggest plantar fasciitis.

I‚Äôve been going to Physical therapy for 7 weeks now. We‚Äôve done stretches, strengthening, ultrasound, laser, electrical muscle stimulation, manual therapy, cupping, and dry needling to heel/arch/calf. 

I‚Äôve seen a podiatrist who said she was confused. She said my heel fat pads at slightly spongey and the left one is a tiny bit thinner but barely noticeable (might not have noticed except for the mri results). The left one is also shifted a bit. But she said nothing it terribly wrong or explains my symptoms to this degree. She‚Äôs making orthotics but given how sensitive my foot is in the most cushioned shoe possible, I‚Äôm skeptical I‚Äôll be able to tolerate them. 

I saw an orthopedic surgeon who looked at my imaging and said I‚Äôm a mystery and said to keep going to PT. Possibly consider an corticosteroid injection.

On my own, I‚Äôve been doing stretches, mobility, strengthening, massage gun to calf, massages to foot and calf, hot water up to knee twice a day, heat pad, frozen water bottle rolling, cupping, and anything else I can think to try. 

A few people have mentioned Raynauds so I‚Äôm awaiting a rheumatologist appointment. My family doctor didn‚Äôt think this is a contributing factor though, since my foot has a pulse.

Work: I work remotely and limit walking. Still I‚Äôm on crutches and have a very hard time. I was doing slightly better before I had to go on a work trip. But even then I got a wheelchair assist in the airport and limited total daily walking to 0.6-1 miles. I came back in tears from pain.

1jek3pn,AskRunningShoeGeeks,3rd Pair of the Same Shoes Causes Arch Pain,"Hi there! I just bought my third pair of Puma Deviate Nitro 3s. The first two pairs were wonderful but unlike many of the reviews i've seen, they wore out pretty quick at about 200-250 miles, at which point intervals would cause shin pain when starting a fast rep after rest. I recently picked up a third pair because while they wear out quick, they fit my feet perfectly and until they wear out they feel amazing. However, this has not been my experience with the new ones. I've had them for a week and a half and they cause immense arch pain but it has been intermittent. On any fast pace (for those who know about it, Repetition pace and Interval Pace) they feel fine but easy and threshold pace causes a lot of pain. At this point they are well over 30 miles in and at a variety of paces so should be broken in. I don't understand it at all. Going to wear a pair of Under Armor running shoes I got for free for my practice tomorrow to see if it's the shoes or if i have something else going on. Any ideas what the problem could be? Also what are some recommendations for similar fitting and feel of shoes (maybe minus a plate)? I also tried on the Hoka Mach 6s in store and liked those a lot too.",2025-03-19 00:09:17+00:00,0,1

- I've been going to PT and they've helped me keep my leg muscles loose. I had super tight hamstring, groin, and calf but it's a lot better now

My training plan had me never running further than 34k, is that a factor of why I found it extremely hard for the last 9k? Any feedback or advice on what I can improve on?

1jeago5,Hoka,My review of the Bondi 8 & Clifton 9,"I recently bought the Bondi 8 and Clifton 9, and while both are solid options from Hoka‚Äôs lineup, I found myself leaning toward the Bondi 8 for a few key reasons. Starting with fit, the Bondi 8 has a notably narrow toebox, which might feel snug for some. I‚Äôd recommend going half a size up to get a more comfortable fit, especially if you prefer a bit more room up front. The Clifton 9, on the other hand, offers a wider toebox, which is great for those who need extra space for their toes to splay. However, its midfoot feels narrow due to the high arch support, which can hug the foot a little too tightly for my liking.

When it comes to stability, the Bondi 8 stands out. Its wider base provides a planted, secure feel that inspires confidence, whether I‚Äôm walking or running. The Clifton 9‚Äôs base, by contrast, isn‚Äôt as wide or stable, and I noticed it didn‚Äôt feel as grounded, especially on uneven surfaces. The Bondi 8‚Äôs max cushioning also gives it a plush, supportive ride that I found more forgiving over longer stretches, while the Clifton 9, though lighter and more responsive, didn‚Äôt match that level of comfort for me.

Overall, I prefer the Bondi 8. Its stability and cushioning outweigh the narrow toebox (easily fixed with a half-size increase), making it my go-to over the Clifton 9, which, despite its wider toebox, loses points for a less stable base and a constricting midfoot. If you‚Äôre torn between the two, try them on‚Äîsizing up might just seal the deal!

1je5ove,walking,Walking shoe recommendations,"Hey there! I have recently finally decided to start working on myself and figured walking would be the best place to start. I am extremely heavy, weighing at 150kg and am looking for a comfortable walking pair of shoes for a heavy person like myself that are going to make the whole experience less stressful. I have ordered some Darn Tough socks hoping to help with blisters and sweat but feel like shoes are something i'm definitely missing. I have been looking at HOKA Clifton 9 Wide but am unsure about the foam on the bottom and if it would go flat quickly due to my weight. I unfortunately cannot afford to be buying new shoes every couple months so I would really appreciate it if somebody had a perfect shoe recommendation that could last me through the whole year at the very least, they don't have to be the most comfortable shoe of all time, just enough to reduce blisters and overall stress on the feet.

  
If you guys have any other walking tips to give to a new walker like myself, I would be very grateful for them, this is the time when I'm most commited to this and really hope that this is the time when I finally succeed in losing weight and sticking to the routine, so any help is much much appreciated!",2025-03-18 14:03:07+00:00,3,12

**Current weekly mileage**: 40-45Miles

**I took a break from running from 2021- November 2024 where I got slow and overweight.**

So as this is an older shoe with the NB5 being sold I was not going to carry out a review but I noticed it being sold in my local Asics outlet (UK) on the weekend for ¬£60.00 and due to the price and that it is still available thought a review would be beneficial.

**Fit:**  
The shoe for me fits true to size in terms of the length although it does feel as though it has more volume than shoes like the Adidas SL2, I prefer a bit of a tighter fit across the top of the shoe than the NB3 gave, I would suggest considering maybe half a size down if your current shoe is on the larger side already. That being said I was able to get a really good lock down in the shoe and was a big fan of the gusseted tongue and lacing.

**Feel**  
The shoe has quite a high stack at 41mm with an 8mm drop, I personally usually go for slightly lower stack height on my every day shoes as sometimes find the stability of the shoe can become a problem for me on larger stacked shoes. That being said the shoe feels and is really stable. It is a soft shoe especially in the midsole not to the extent that you feel that you are running in marshmallows but soft enough that you feel that your getting a good level of impact protection which was a big driver for me with my weight especially when I first got the shoe.  
  
It is not the lightest shoe and its not a shoe that I felt become an extension of me such as the EVO SL or for those who remember the Nike epic reacts. I ran up to 15 miles in the shoe and never experienced any discomfort except after one run where the padding on both the heels ended up rubbing away (still not sure how this happened as did not notice it on the run or have different socks on etc) ¬†  
  
**Performance**

The shoe was fantastic for easy and long runs where the miles would just disappear and the legs would feel fresh this was a massive thing for me as I was building up mileage volume and wanted to try to protect my legs as much as possible. When working at the tempo range again the shoe was able to hold up however did not feel as slick as shoes such as the EVO SL and Pegasus Turbo and when running intervals or repetitions just didn‚Äôt have the pep that I like and need. But as an everyday trainer I don‚Äôt think that you can go wrong with it. In terms of grip the shoe has performed well I mentioned the stability earlier, I run predominantly on country lanes where there is a lot of agricultural usage so the roads are a mess and when wet and icy become slick excluding a couple of really icy days I had not issues with the grip of the shoe. I am now 350+ miles in and the upper and the sole are actually in good shape apart from the tearing on the heel, the cushioning is now starting to struggle and on the toe off can feel that its lost some of the structure this is really noticeable at 6+ miles at the moment now remembering that even now I am considered overweight I think the shoe has done well. I am still using it in my rotation but will be using it now for 4-6mile easy recovery runs and utilising the Adidas SL2 more for the longer easy miles.

**Overall conclusions**

This is a really great shoe for its price, if you are looking for a daily workhorse which can cover the majority of your training needs then this would be a great option and at ¬£60.00 if you‚Äôre a heavy mileage runner this represents great value. If you are a heavier runner and are looking for something that will provide you cushioning which will last then this is a great option for you. I have also ran in the NB4 but not to this extent of this shoe and actually prefer the NB3. The NB4 definitely feels firmer and slightly more responsive but I found the fit not as comfortable even though it has less volume than the 3 with me struggling on occasion to get as comfortable lock down. I also found that the 4 on the really slow recovery miles to not feel as comfortable.  
  
**Other shoes to potentially consider available now:**  
Adidas SL2 ‚Äì tighter fit, more responsive but still feels cushioned enough as a heavier runner over longer distances. Handles the faster miles better

Adidas Evo ‚Äì If your looking for a comfortable well cushioned non plated shoe which can handle interval and rep. This is a tighter fit which I like without feeling restrictive.

1jdgmlc,PlantarFasciitis,Five years in and worse off now,"Hey all, 

I'm feeling disappointed and don't want to discourage anyone but have commented saying I'd detail my process.

My PF started in 2020 when I was home a lot and barefoot on hardwood. It was mild at first and for the first three and a half years would come and go. During this period my Oofos slides really saved me! I'd wear them around the house to prevent and help recover PF flare ups. I had a couple pairs of flat, hard shoes I KNEW would cause a flare for a couple of weeks but sometimes I would do it anyway. It had always cycled on and off and was treatable with rest, good footwear, no barefoot walking, and time.

Fast forward to late 2023/early 2024 and I'd started a new job where I'm either standing or running almost the whole 12 hour shift. Despite investing in good shoes (Hoka Clinton's and Brooks Glycerin) after a few months my PF was no longer coming in phases. It was constant and now oscillating between bearable pain while living my full life and unbearable pain so I don't do anything. The Brooks definitely felt way better than my Hokas, for what it's worth, and I think I wore them out and was too cheap to replace them when I should have. I believe that's part of my issue that I'm still trying to get back under control.

I started seeing a podiatrist in 2024. He was very surprised that I'd been managing this on my own for so long with how severe it is. He immediately had me in bilateral ankle supports and fitted for custom insoles. He referred me to PT and said he was worried i was headed for a traumatic tear of my Achilles if i didnt get this under rapid control and he confirmed that I'm in the disease stage where it's no longer primarily inflammatory, but degenerative. PT found that my calves are messed up from this too and have a lot of underlying muscle inflammation making them look a lot larger than they should, proportionately. This comes up later. Also, I've always had VERY inflexible ankles and wrists, which I suspect is somehow making this worse. Even as a kid couldn't do the ""primal squat"", can't do push ups or CPR without wrist accommodation. Idk what the issue is but I think there's something wonky there. Anyway, those are the things that might make my case unique and I refer to them below when appropriate. 

 Across five years, here's the combo of everything I've tried/am trying:

Footwear:
-Oofos: big yes here! Inside wear only but hardwood floors are a killer.

-Hoka's (clifton): ehhhh. If anything they aggregate my calves.

-Brooks Glycerin: these helped me for a while! Still my go-to so I don't make it worse. 

-Sizing up on shoes: YES! Go stand on one of their gimicky machines and round up on the size of your longer foot. Turns out one of my feet was almost a full size bigger and I'd been neglecting that for my whole life. Definitely size up! 

-Custom insoles: ehhh. I truly don't feel like they've helped but I'm trying to give them a chance still. Every time I wear them my foot and calf pain is worse. I wear them for half shifts at least and have been trying it for months. Feeling like tossing in the towel here.

-Compression socks: I'm unsure if these helped my PF. But with the way the disease has affected my calves the compression socks felt either not tight on my feet or WAY too tight on my upper calves and I was worried I was causing vascular damage through venous congestion by cutting off the outflow. Kind of the opposite of the intent behind them.

-Compressive ankle braces: I was wearing these daily and I think the compression that extended to my plantar fascia did help a bit but not for more than a couple of weeks. My podiatrist said that my foot condition from the PF means that if I even get a sprain it'll need surgical correction to heal right so I'd anything I toss these bad boys on to hedge my bets if I feel like I might be jumping or something stupid to prevent rolling my ankle.

-Rigid ankle braces/night boots: I couldn't quite figure these out. My ankle flexibility is such that a 90 degree angle of flexion is pretty much my max. Holding it there (for my mri too) makes my foot go numb and it requires so much pressure that it was cutting off circulation which didn't feel like the move for healing. I'm sure someone with more flexibility in their ankles could really benefit from these though!

Therapies:

-Ice: doesn't have an immediate impact BUT consistent icing over a few days does seem to help. The tricky part is that it can contract the muscle so STRETCH YOUR CALVES after icing once they're warm again before walking/activity.

-Heat: provides some relief, but not lasting. Use with caution in early phases of PF when its still mostly inflammatory.

-Elevation: only seems to help after a 12 hour shift, nothing magic, also $0 though. 

-Stretching: yes! DO NOT OVER DO IT for the love of God. I discovered that stretching helped my flare ups. So when I was having a mild flare I stretched. And stretched. And stretched more because it helped and I didn't want to be in pain anymore. And then I over stretched apparently and that started this chronic flare that I haven't gotten back under control. Because I couldn't stretch my calves anymore and they just got tighter and began to cramp, but stretching made it worse. The cramping calf pulled on my Achilles and therefore PF and I sincerely don't think I've recovered from that. It's been 11 months of zero pain free days. Stretching helps. Limit it to twice a day or something.

-Deep tissue massage: this is done by my PT. During these treatments I am crying and sweating from pain. I pre-med before going. It's awful. I end up with severe bruising on my calves. She can't go deep enough on my feet because I will scream but she goes as deep as she can there. HOWEVER, the very second she stops I feel immediate relief. Maybe that's endogenous opiates from the torture, but it lasts at least the rest of the day and typically the foot pain won't wake me up that night. She says my calves are getting better but the chronic effects have inflamed and altered the muscle. It is not feeling any better when she does it buy in holding on hope. She wants me there twice a week but I can't go in until the bruising clears which means I'm in once a week. I think once I can tolerate more work on my feet maybe the torture sessions will help?

-Ultrasound therapy (PT): I'm convinced this is placebo but I'm doing it anyway and it feels nice while it's happening, usually right before or after deep tissue and just having a different, slightly warm sensation is really nice.

-Electrotherapy/TENS (PT): Yes do this! This isn't healing me but it does give me ~30 min of no pain when I stand up after my appointment and that's simply amazing. No notes. Do this every time it's offered to you.

-Epsom salt soak: yeah I think it helps. Especially if you get your calves. It doesn‚Äôt make my pain zero but even controlling the calf pain provides some relief and it's probably overall helpful for healing. It also costs like $0.15 per soak so it's the cheapest and most normal feeling list item.

-Exercise-specific therapies (PT):  PT is focusing on strengthening and stretching everything from the waist down. I'm already very strong in my legs/glutes so the slowest progression has been using a resistance band to train my ankles. I'm a VERY firm believer in physical therapy. They're the literal miracle workers of our medical system. That's why I'm still going, but to be honest it's been a month of no progress yet (despite good adherence to exercises). PT takes time, but usually there's some effect by now üòî

-Acupuncture: I'm literally still shocked I went. I'm very needle phobic. I'm also desperate. I was shaking when she first started but it was honestly better than I expected. I only did one session and maybe it's something that takes time but I'm unconvinced. I have one more appointment booked but I'm not expecting miracles from skin pokes.
Weight loss: I'm not sure if this fits here but I'll say my flare ups don't seem to correlate with weight gain. Since the flare up has gotten worse in this last stretch I have lost some weight (hard to do while so sedentary and cooking healthy meals is painful) but for me it doesn't seem to help.

Nutrition:

-Protein: I'm being told to massively scale up my protein intake. I'm trying. It's hard. Standing up and cooking is hard. Food is getting more expensive. But I've found a few protein-rich freezer foods for when I'm not able to cook, I'm investing in a protein powder, and am adding tofu and Greek yogurt to things so nothing I eat is absent of protein altogether. 

-Collagen: I'm unconvinced but desperate anyway and will start with a collagen powder. As far as I can tell, protein gets broken down in your gut before being absorbed anyway so I don't think collagen should be more effective than other complete proteins but take my money. 

-Vitamin C/copper/zinc: this gets a little deep in the biochem and I'm not sure it'll make a difference but I am starting to supplement with these. Basically you need to support your body to regenerate collagen and connective tissue and providing the cofactors to do that seems worth a shot while I'm doing everything else to support my body to do that healing.

-Magnesium: yes! Certainly helps with the calf issues from PF. It also helps me sleep better and when I'm being woken up from pain I'm really invested in the best quality of sleep I can get for the remaining time. I also think I wake up less from pain when I take substantial amounts. Mag oxide doesn't seem to help, mag citrate WILL give you GI issues if you don't start slowly. There are several different mag salts and I've experimented a bit.

Topicals:
-Voltaren gel: this magic gel works so much better for every other pain I've ever had and it's minimally effective for my PF. Not ineffective, but I might as well take ibuprofen.

-Castor oil: I've seen this recommended and just tried for the first time last night. I don't see a harm. I also don't see a benefit but I'm going to keep trying:)

-Arnica: I'm using this to heal my PT bruises a little faster so I can go more often. I think it does help, but nothing magic. I think DMSO would work better but it's hard to find these days.

Things I haven't yet tried but are on the menu:
-Progressive loading: I haven't gotten to a place of non-severe flare to do this since learning about it. I'm exercising my feet and calves anyway but am not sure about scaling up loading while in such a bad/long flare. Open to input though!

-PRP injections: I'm TERRIFIED of the pain from this and honestly going to the acupuncturist was me trading a tiny needle for these ones. My podiatrist wants to try it once the pain is more localized to one spot in my heel/foot in each side. Insurance won't cover it and the evidence is shaky but he says he's seen good results before. I'm already in pain so a little more isn't off the table.

-DMSO: honestly this is mostly an access barrier. For those who have uses it successfully for PF, we're you using it to transport something else?


I'm open for questions or input!

I did that, then a 10K, and a 13.1, and the 26.2. Never really felt the need to pursue the ultra distances that he is addicted to, but do enjoy staying fit and with more energy too. (Plus my acid reflux nearly vanished and clothes were slimmer. All good things. I'd done all of this in the Speedgoat style as well (based on his recommendations). They felt great. Then I broke my stupid ankle. Twice. In one year. (April, then Dec)!

It was not the shoes fault, nor mine, just dumb accidents that were nearly identical (lost just a bit of balance and landed on my left foot wrong at an uneven curb. The worst is they were within probably 500 feet of each other (just different streets). It's become something of a joke both in the family and in the neighborhood. I'm the guy who used to run but now trips down the sidewalk! lol

**Anyway**, since switching from running across multiple surfaces to mostly sidewalks and concrete, I noticed the Speedgoats were not really giving me as much cushion as my now tender feet wanted. So, I naturally transitioned to the Cliftons.

These worked well for a while, but now I am noticing foot soreness/pain after a mere 250mi (400km). The shoes don't seem too worn out based on the beatings prior versions took but my feet are now very sore after walking not even a 10K yesterday. Does this treadwear look like I've over-worn them? (They are a daily walker, so maybe I am not giving them enough rest time as I don't use a rotation like I used to...)



I'd be interested in the collective opinion of those who run/walk more often than me. Does this tread look too worn? Should I keep them in my rotation? Other thoughts?

1jcr954,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Cielo X1 1.0/2.0 First Thoughts Comparison,"Background: M30 150 lbs, HM 1:35 Daily Trainer: Hoka Mach 6



What I‚Äôve done so far: (2.0) 7 mile break-in run at 8:15 min/mile pace and half marathon at 7:15 min/miles.  (1.0) 10 miles with 5 miles at 9:00 min/mile pace and 5 miles at 8:15 min/miles.



Upper Fit 1.0: Fits TTS.  More snug than the 2.0 on step-in but the material stretches.  Material is thicker and less breathable than the 2.0.  There is no structure around the heel and I did have some minor irritation from the lack of padding on the achilles.  I‚Äôm using a version with the updated laces so no problems there.



Upper Fit 2.0: Also TTS.  More spacious and very accommodating toe box.  Material is more plastic-like on the 2.0 and the upper has structure to it, very breathable.  The heel is padded and points out similar to the Mach 6 - which I absolutely loved for a race day shoe.  The 2.0 upper imo is improved in every way.



Midsole/Stability 1.0: Platform is thick and bouncy.  Corners required some slowing down, but downhill felt great.  The lack of structure doesn‚Äôt protect ankles as much on uneven landings.  Could feel the carbon plate more under my heels, so landing midfoot was preferable - but not required.  Foam/plate is very protective, and after the first run (5mi fast/5mi easy) I feel like these definitely helped reduce running effort.



Midsole/Stability 2.0: More ground feel on these but still a protective foam (midfoot) platform.  Corners require slowing down and running downhill with the steep rocker was somewhat uncontrollable.  The upper structure combined with forefoot platform width helps the footstrike feel more controlled, BUT there‚Äôs nothing to land on towards the heel, so you‚Äôre forced onto that mid or forefoot.  Foam and plate still have a nice bounce but the rocker feels much more aggressive here.  Running feels effortless but the geometry can feel harsh on leg muscles.



Pace/Purpose 1.0: My intended use for these will be long runs.  That said, it is a carbon plated ‚Äúrace day‚Äù shoe, so it does push you faster than an unplated daily trainer would.  It still felt good at easy effort but it isn‚Äôt something I would mindlessly easy cruise with.  It felt best imo at that slightly-faster than easy pace speed.  Picking up the pace felt great but only to an extent, they required much more effort maintaining my HM pace (7:15 min/mile) than the 2.0‚Äôs did.  That in-between HM and easy effort pace was the sweet spot (8:15 min/mile) and was my preference.



Pace/Purpose 2.0: You can‚Äôt easy run in these, period.  My attempt to do so on my first run defaulted straight to that faster 8:15 min/mile pace.  They feel incredible at that fast pace and completely effortless.  Even at that fast but not quite race pace-effort they beat up your muscles.  These are meant to go fast only and be efficient at doing so.  At race pace these will push you to your limit if you allow them to.



Final Thoughts: I much prefer the comfort of the 2.0, but the aggression makes it a race-effort shoe only.  The 1.0 feels better for training runs, but it‚Äôs not as comfortable, and I would not use it for race-efforts.",2025-03-16 17:52:33+00:00,39,6

1jcmylw,AskRunningShoeGeeks,HELP... do I have impossible feet?,"Hi everyone, 

I started running last year and fell in love with it. 

For context, I have Greek feet (2nd toe is longer than the first), that are quite narrow and slim (my ankles as well), yet long (I'm a EU 40.5 woman) which makes finding the right shoe very complicated for me, even day to day trainers or boots.

I went to get fitted in a shoe store and they told me since I'm a EU 40.5 I should be wearing a 41 or 41.5 in running shoes. They told me I shouldn't try ON or Hoka because they are usually for wider feet. 

The ONLY shoe that has worked for me is the Novablast 3. I tried the gel kinsei max and Nimbus 25 and 27 from asics, 40.5 was a better fit in the overall foot but my 2nd toe was touching the front, then 41.5 was fine for my 2nd toe but gave me blisters because my feet were dancing inside. Btw I wear the right running socks and the shoe store employee showed me the way to tie my laces in order for my feet not to move inside, but I still got blisters. 

I'm looking for comfortable shoes for long runs (2-3 hours) yet responsive enough...

I tried New balance fresh foam evoz and fresh foam 1080 but I felt very heavy in them. I got very used to the responsiveness of my Novablast 3 and I use it for tempo, intervals and long run as well. It's quite literally the only running shoe I have. 

I tried the Novablast 5 but to my horror I realized they made the shoe wider somehow, and the front is rounder, which means my 2nd toe is now touching the front of the shoe when it's not the case for my Novablast 3 with the same size.

Any tips or advice would be highly appreciated because I am lost. 

Thank you

1jcapxd,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Springy & Stable Shoe Recs,"TL;DR: Love the Hoka Skyflow's cushion/spring, but need more stability for overpronation. Considering ASICS Novablast, Dynablast, or GT-2000. Hoping for something with a better balance of cushion/responsiveness and stability.


 * Recently bought Hoka Skyflows for joint pain & mild overpronation. Love the cushion/spring, but arch rub and stability concerns. I'm not against keeping them, I just think there might be a better option.
 * I'm overweight which is adding to joint impact as I'm increasing my activity.  Mainly walking paved areas, but I want to start casual hiking. 
 * Tried ASICS Novablast (cushy, but lacks stability similar to the Skyflows). But I've heard they're more durable than Skyflows, and they are slightly cheaper.
 * Considering ASICS Dynablast (possible compromise: less spring, more stability?). I haven't tried these on and would need to order online, so I'm just working off reviews and online comparisons right now.
 * ASICS GT-2000 recommended for stability, but concerned about responsiveness. I haven't tried them on yet, but there is a store nearby that I can try them at if recommended. 
 * Looking for shoe recommendations that blend cushion/spring/responsiveness with good stability.


My feet are wide which has ruled out many options. I tried on Kayano 31s and they were ok, but no spring/responsiveness like I'm hoping for. I've tried several Brooks styles and haven't been a fan of any.

1jc8ad8,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Half marathon training + race day shoe,"I F21 5'3 125lbs am running my first half in a month, aiming for a sub 2h. Right now I am using the Hoka Mach 6 for basically all my runs that are not tempo/speedwork, for which I am using the rebels v4. My rebels are a bit beat up so I don't really like using them for something longer than 10k. I'm doing 30-50km per week.

I tried the Boston 12s in store and didn't like the lace situation and they didn't really hold my ankles well. The endorphin speed 4 were good, and the store guy recommended the Nike zoom Fly 6 and I really liked them too. I am still hesitant about using nylon/carbon plated shoes since I'm not that advanced into running I guess, but the Endorphins and the ZF6 did feel great.

Should I just get something like the NB1080s (I tried them and they were good), or the Novablasts (they don't have them available in any of my running stores so I don't think I can try them on sadly unless I buy them and then return), or go for the plated shoes? This would be for daily training (10k-18k) but also for the race. I am running another half in June so will keep training with these shoes. Thank you for the advice!",2025-03-15 23:37:47+00:00,1,2

1jc783x,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Race Shoe Recommendations with similar feel as ES3?,"Hello there,

I'm looking for a race shoe recommendation for my upcoming half marathon in May, targeting a finish time of 1:35-1:40.

My current shoe rotation consists of:

* Saucony Endorphin Speed 3 (all-rounder)
* Hoka Bondi 8 (easy runs)
* New Balance SC Elite v4 (races)

Although I already own the SC Elite v4 and enjoy running in it, I find the midsole a bit too soft for my liking and also have had issues with heel lockdown. As a result, I'm planning to purchase a new race shoe to replace the SC Elite v4 and use the SC Elite v4 as a tempo shoe going forward.

A bit about myself is that I'm a cadence-style runner and I'm looking for a race shoe with a firmer midsole than the SC Elite v4. I really enjoy the speedroll technology of the Saucony ES3 where I feel I can push the pace and was wondering if other runners have found a race shoe with a similar on-foot feel.

I plan to visit a local running store soon where they have some selection of race shoes, including:

* Saucony Endorphin Elite 2 (heard the midsole is quite soft)
* Saucony Endorphin Pro 4 (heard mixed things about this shoe)
* Metaspeed Paris shoes (based on Asics description, the Sky would suit me better)
* Hoka options (Cielo X1 2.0, Mach X2, Rocket X2)

Unfortunately, the store does not have the Adios Pro 4, Nike, Puma, or ON options. I'd love to hear any recommendations from you all!",2025-03-15 22:46:10+00:00,1,3

1jc15pj,beginnerrunning,Stride and first HM,"Running my first half marathon in 6 weeks, I have previously ran only a 5K in race format. Ive been running actively for about 14-18 months. I am on the larger side (M 6'3"", 245 lbs (-75lbs since 12/2022)) with a fast mile around 8:20 and avg time around 9:30-10:00. 

In my training im doing 3-6 miles per outting 5 days a week with leg training (and other strength training mixed in) its going well, but I find im too explosive in pace/stride early on and my times rapidly drop, breathing becomes more erratic/shallow which leads to side stiching and walking. 

I use the treadmill to gauge pacing but translating it to road seems eh at best and I dont want to stare at my watch the entire time to see my pace intervals. What tips/methods do you use to maintain pace and stride with a somewhat equal distribution on longer runs? 

If it matters my shoe lineup is Hoka Mach 6 and 1 time a week usually (sometimes 1 time every other week) I train in my race day shoes which will be the Alpha flys. ",2025-03-15 18:05:37+00:00,1,1

Overall feel, cushioning and support was great.

The AF3 and AP4, as well as New Balance's new marathon show, felt pretty awesome, but still couldn't pull the trigger. Eventually I ended up trying the Hoka Cielo X1 2.0, and holy crap, those shoes just want to rip a fast pace. It is another level of aggressive compared to the previously mentioned shoes. I did love them, but had some second thoughts due to people saying how unstable they are (they are very unstable, I felt it on my first stride but adjusted quickly). Are there any shoes I didn't mention with a similar aggressive/propulsive feeling the Cielo X1 2, but with a bit more stability? I'm this close to buying the Cielo's but thinking that I should maybe play it safer for my first pair of super shoes. FYI, I am pretty firmly a mid foot striker, (less so on my left foot), have a slightly wider than medium width foot, currently doing daily training in the Nike Invincible 3's and planning to run no slower than 6:15min/mi in the shoes. Planning to only use these for race day, up to half marathon distances. On a side note, do Mizuno's Wave Rebellion Pro's have a similar sensation to the Hoka's? Have heard these are another very unstable super shoe.

My go to running shoes are the Hoka Arahi 7.

Just wanting to know from people who have done the Queenstown half marathon/marathon before, if road running shoes would still be appropriate for this event?

1jbphu4,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Looking For New Running Shoes After L5 S1 Spinal Fusion," I am 2 months post L5 S1 TLIF surgery and am looking to get back   
into running after another month or 2. I used to run in Nike Free's.   
Have been for the last 15 years. However, the doctor tells me I need   
more cushioning on the feet to lessen the impact on my lower back. My   
feet are pretty flat and doing various ""foot"" fits in shops, they   
suggest shoes with more arch support. I need shoes with a heel tab that   
is not too high nor hard. I tried running in older Pegasus Flyknits   
before the Free's and they ended up digging a hole in my foot near the   
achilles tendon.  
    
I pretty much do just treadmill running followed by weights at the   
gym so a pair of shoes I could use for both would be ideal without   
having to bring a pair for running and another for weights. I used to do  
 2 days of HIIT runs for 30 mins at a sprint pace of 16 kmh at an   
incline of 2 for 1 min followed by resting off the treadmill for 40s;   
also 2 days of 30-40 mins of just running at 10 kmh at no incline. So I   
guess not really a lot of running by most standards  
    
My shortlst so far is:  
    
Asics GT-2000 13¬†  
Nike React Phantom Run Flyknit 2 - these felt closest to Nike Free's but with more cushion  
Nike React Infinity Run 4  
Hoka Arahi 7  
Hoka Mach 6  
NB 860  
    
I was interested in trying On but the local stores do not carry them in my size which is on the small side.  
   
If the above do not provide sufficient cushioning, please let me know. Any other suggestions appreciated.

1jbdvvu,trailrunning,Travel trail shoes in wide,"I know is not the most ideal due to the outsole but would any of these be fairly ok to use for full travel space is an issue that why I always only bring 1 pair of shoes.

Thinking about the:
NB Hierro V9 4E
Topo Ultraventure 4 2E - the outsole photo looks to be much wider than the Traverse and a bit wider than the Terraventure 4.
Hoka Challenger 7 2E
Merrell Nova 4 wide
Brooks Cascadia is a no go as the color in wide is too bright.
Saucony Peregrine 15 wide
Altra Lone Peak 9 wide - is says to be their widest

1jaww3r,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Benched runner with recurrent PTTD seeks stability shoe so I don‚Äôt completely lose my mind,"Hey everyone, I‚Äôve recently been benched due to a flare up of the bane of my existence (tib post tendinitis) and need to find a decent stability shoe or I‚Äôll go nuts.


I thought I beat this beast so I got massively overexcited and bought some amazing new neutral runners (endorphin speed 4, Cloudflow 4 and Superblast 2 - and no, I didn‚Äôt need all 3 but it‚Äôs been a journey ok) but 2 months in my old friend is back despite orthotics and lots of PT. Turns out I probs should have eased back into running life with a stability shoe. I LOVE the shoes I bought, I just get to stare lovingly at them instead of use them rn üò≠


So I‚Äôm taking a few steps back and going for a boring stability shoe that will need to do double duty for walking and running. The problem is I‚Äôve got weird feet and I‚Äôm finding it hard to find the right shoe.


Pls send help/advice/anything before I spend all my money on shoes I don‚Äôt wear!


- Me: 35yo F, 55kg
- My feet: flat, narrow, low volume. I overpronate and have a bunion. I have awesome custom orthotics so don‚Äôt really need arch support, more medial stability.
- Things I like: rocker sole for my sexy bunion, a firm-ish shoe, ideally not massive stack height, 6-10mm drop


Shoes I don‚Äôt enjoy: kayano, ghost, adrenaline, Tempus 2, nimbus, cloudflyer 5, most Hokas


Shoes I am ok with but don‚Äôt love: gt-2000 (maybe not enough support), ghost max 2 (comes up too high in front of ankle)


Shoes I am considering: 
- On cloud runner 2
- Saucony hurricane 24


The cloud runner is a nice basic lower stack shoe but is a smidge wide for me without my orthotic - unsure if that defeats the purpose.
The hurricane is super comfy but a bit clunky and oh so high off the ground. I also felt like it fought my orthotic a bit- too much stability action? The new guide 18 isn‚Äôt available where I live currently.


If anyone has other suggestions I‚Äôd love to hear. 


Side bar: If anyone on this feed has beaten PTTD please send me some positive words cos I‚Äôm feeling a bit down about it ü´†",2025-03-14 05:41:09+00:00,2,9

I‚Äôve been using Hoka Cliftons exclusively for the last few years for casual running up to half marathon races. My current pair has 220 miles on them, so I‚Äôm expecting to need new shoes ahead of race day.

Before just ordering another pair of Cliftons to start rotating with, is there value in rotating with something different?

I know there‚Äôs value in going to a local running store but also would ideally take advantage of online discounts vs full price in store.

My longest run so far has been 13.2 miles with weekly mileage 25-40 miles. Typical pace ~9:30-45 mile and aiming for 4:30-5 hr marathon time, so I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôd be looking for a carbon/speedy race shoe

This is the first I'm hearing of this shoe. I guess it's Saucony's attempt at a supertrainer a la Superblast or Zoom Fly 6? It's a little on the heavy side and there is a serious lack of outsole on this shoe with tons of exposed foam like some older Hokas had.

I have serious concerns about the durability and wet weather grip.  It's also more expensive than the Nike ZF6 and Adidas Evo SL.  It's only $20 less than the widely lauded Superblast 2.  Saucony is late to the party with their supertrainer and going by the specs, it looks like the least impressive offering.

1jaf88k,PlantarFasciitis,How soon do you know if a new shoe work or doesn't work for you?,"I developed PF about a month ago when I went from no treadmill activity to power walking 4x a week for 2 weeks. I noticed that during these walks my feet would get hot and start tingling within 10 minutes but just pushed through because I assumed I'd get used to it, I was wrong. I was swapping between my skechers - my softest shoe and normally love, and my under armours.

While I'm sure this PF is from the drastic change in routine, I also don't think it was normal for my feet to feel the way they did 10 minutes in so I researched shoes and landed on the Hoka Bondi 9.

I've been wearing them around the house for a day and my feet seem to be more sore. How long do you usually give a new pair? This is my first time buying with foot pain and in the past I've never needed time to adjust. So is it that it doesn't work for me or I need to give it more time? 

My feet are hot in them, they do put a bit of pressure on the top of my foot, and honestly while there is a lot of cushion they are super firm which leaves me longing for my soft skechers. On the plus side they are supportive.

No idea if I should give it more time to adjust or take it as my feet hate them and stop now.

Thoughts? 

TLDR: New Hoka Bondi 9 making my feet more sore after a day, do you usually give shoes more time for your feet to adjust? If so how long? ",2025-03-13 15:53:55+00:00,4,26

Bottom line is I'm having to keep replacing my gtx shoes after only moderate use. They don't seem to last for more than 3 races losing it's waterproofness quickly sometimes due to holes within the uppers or poorly made tongues etc.

Anybody have long term experience with the durability of the waterproof aspect of the above shoes? There are no reviews online regarding this. 


More details about my circumstances below:
I do ultras (competitive at regional level) and long distance hikes including snow/crap weather.  I like hokas as they do fit my foot shape ok (slightly wide) and feel light on feet. Goto shoes are zinals/speedgoats/tectons/cliftons. Altras/topo are best for my wide feet but heavy and zero bounce. Salomon used to be too narrow/stiff for me (speed cross 3 and 4). Saucony (peregrine) heavy/narrow but comfy/slow. Endorphin fast but narrow/stiff. Inov8 average but questionable build quality. 

I'm looking for a shoe that's wp for 2 main uses
1) Hiking with optionality for running - multi day hikes all weather. When backpacking you can't bring shoe rotation with you. 
2) Races >24hours to keep feet dry as long as possible (I know they eventually get damp) till I can reach a drop bag checkpoint (typically 8-12h before I can swap shoes)

My main criteria for this shoe 
Replace my no longer waterproof sg5 gtx (died during race 3, maybe 400km total mileage)

Next came Hoka Bondi 9 in wide and size 8.5. A little tighter around the top of my foot but wayyy better and felt like my walk was more corrected. Crazy thing is my arch is so high that the highest arch added insole wasn‚Äôt touching it much. I got the shoes and bought a different ‚Äúhigh arch insole‚Äù on Amazon.

1j9zztd,PlantarFasciitis,Finally progress after 2 years,"Hi Everyone, just sharing my experiences after 2 years.  I slipped and fell hiking and sprained my ankle coming out of covid.  This started a cycle of foot pain.   Went to a podiatrist was diagnosed with plantar faciiatis and received a custom orthotic, night splints.   They were extremely painful so I gave up on them, decided to work out more at the gym with lower body exercises.  Feet continued to get worse.   Tried multiple off the shelf orthotics, HOKA Bondi 8‚Äôs and after another year went to a different podiatrist who told me I have heel spurs, gave me shots and medicine to reduce inflammation and ordered me custom orthotics.   Told him of my prior experience in hopes he would try something different.   Again, very painful orthotics with even less cushioning, feels like I am walking on a hump.

Finally decided I‚Äôll just read all the posts here on reddit and try anything that makes sense.   

What worked - 

1. I went to a local shoe store that specializes in foot issues.   They recommended a lower drop shoe with more mid foot support.  They also do physical therapy and have a good reputation.  I purchased the Brooks Addiction.   Their opinion is I don‚Äôt need massive arch support orthotics and my walk is normal with no pronation.  OMG, so much better.   
2. I am also going easy on my feet to give them time to heal but already walked an hour last few days with minimal pain.  
3. Wearing light compression socks to hopefully improve blood flow to speed up healing.
4. Put an app on my computer to remind me to stand and move every hour.

I think that the new lower drop shoes with improved support are helping me more than anything.

It feels like podiatrists are out to sell surgeries and custom orthotics and made it worse not better for me.  Why did neither start with what shoe are you wearing?  I have been wearing the Brooks Ghost‚Äôs almost exclusively.  Based on this evidence based chart the Ghost has a very big drop and minimal mid foot support.  

Hope this helps someone else out there and it continues to improve for me.   ",2025-03-13 00:57:43+00:00,15,11
1j9zb7o,AskRunningShoeGeeks,"Looking for shoes for lab worker, lots of standing and walking, shoes might get dirty","Hi everyone, my old shoes are starting to fall apart in their fourth year. Honestly they served me well. I searched to just buy a new pair but skechers had updated the shoe. The new one is the Dantay Parral Bungee SR. Despite my old ones being a 9.5 and the new one needed to be an 8 to fit (crazy), they caused so much pain (I did try all the sizes in-between, several Amazon returns later oof). I have never returned worn shoes before but these were so painful after over a week. I decided that good shoes are worth it even tho they are expensive. 

I tried on the Asics Gel Nimbus 26 and 27, and found that in the Wide 9 felt amazing when I put my insoles in them, and bought them.

Today I'm feeling massive regrets, as these shoes have fabric uppers and I'm feeling paranoid about gross stuff that could spill on them. My old shoes were leather or synthetic leather so I never worried about it, I could just wipe it off.  I also weigh a lot of yeast extract and if you know anything about that, it's a powder that gets EVERYWHERE and is sticky.

Can I water-proof/resistant them with sketch guard? I feel like it won't work. 

I had tried on the HOKA bonding SR but the gel nimbus were so so so much more comfortable. 

Are any of the gore tex asics women's shoes as comfortable as the gel nimbus? I feel like it's the PureGEL insole that must make them so so comfortable, but looking at all the models none of the gore tex models have them. My store didn't have any of the goretex shoes. (Do they sell the insoles separately? )

Additionally, none of the goretex shoes come in wide, which felt the best when I added my insole. Are men's asics similar enough to women's wide that I could look into those?

I tried calling asics customer service but they only have options for help with orders, not shoe advice :c

If anyone has any advice on shoes for a lab worker that I can wipe clean and be comfortable for standing and walking on concrete for long hours, I would so appreciate whatever you have to say! 

Finding the right shoes is so stressful

They feel very light, slightly less cushioned than Hokas but still pretty comfortable.

I weight 89 kilos, trail running is my winter sport, not my primary activity. I manage around 6-6:30 m/km on the rolling terrain.

They handle mud pretty well, no slipping or side movement. Didn‚Äôt try resistance against puddles, can‚Äôt comment there. They cleared mud pretty quickly.

I noticed they are pretty sensitive to proper lace tension as the heel cup is not as pronounced/hugging and when running uphill on forefoot, I could feel the heel cup move. Retightening solves this but not 100%.

All in all, for about 90‚Ç¨ I cannot be happier.
I will update after some runs on the durability.

I'm looking to improve my time for an October marathon (~aiming for 3:30), compete in Hyrox and attempt an ~60k for charity.

Most of the pairing recommendations seem to be AP3 or EP3 as they're very stable for carbon-plated shoes.

I go to university 4 days a week and usually fit in around 6k-12k steps a day. I also do weightlifting 2-3 times a week. My current shoes are some Nike Air monarchs, but they're starting to fall apart on me.

I'm 5'9, 220lbs (working on it), a size 9 mens in 4E, and I have orthotics for my flat feet. I've been looking around a lot of places for shoes that fit 4E, and I've come up with this list:

1) new balance 1080v14, I've tested these in store and they just feel like they push you forward on each step. That being said, the ankle support felt a little weird (maybe because I'm used to hard leather shoes), and I'm not too sure if the tread is good for everyday use.

2) asics nimbus 27, also tried these out in store and they felt super comfy to walk in, not sure how good of a pick this is for everyday use.

3) asics kayano 31, tested these out and they felt harder than the 2 above for sure, but not uncomfortable. Overall felt very solid.

4) hoka bondi 9, felt right in between the kayano and 1080, felt like a good middle ground.

I've also tried out the new balance 990v6, and 880v15 and didn't really like either, they both felt like very solid shoes but I was looking for something with more cushion. Although now that I've looked around a bit walking shoes shouldn't have as much cushion? Not sure.

I haven't tried out any other new balance really, I'm a little curious about the 840, 860, and the leather 928. Also curious about brooks, haven't looked into those too much.

My budget is around $200 CAD, I'm located in the greater Toronto area if that matters. I also plan for these to be my only pair of shoes due to a tight budget. Any help choosing or other recommendations would be appreciated!

TLDR: need new shoes in 4E for everyday use, no serious running (yet).

1j7yqp2,Hoka,My 4th Hoka pairs with this same issue!,"I started with the Bondi 8 and the front started to peel after about 5 months. I then filed for warranty and switched to the Bondi SR leather ones and 3 months later I had the same issue. I switched again under warranty to another SR model and went with wide hoping to get a new line and avoid the issue and again several months later it started peeling. Once more filed for warranty, this time I switched back to the Bondi 9 I believe instead and this is the result after 4 months. I work at a retail store about 5 hours 3 times a week, this is the extend of the use of these shoes with some exceptions when I throw them in sometimes to go to the store or something. The shoes are very comfortable and look brand new with the exception of the front lip always peeling and making the shoe look like it‚Äôs broken and not presentable for work. Is anyone else experiencing this issue? At this point I don‚Äôt know what to even buy from them to avoid this.

1j7wuj2,PlantarFasciitis,"sneaker ideas for PF, wear a 16 wide","Hi,

I have been battling PF for over a year and went to a podiatrist and they suggested sneakers that are labeled as stability or motion control.  I wear a 16 wide so that makes it tough.  I'm also frugal which has been tough although I realize now I may have to just suck it up and spend $150 on a pair.   I typically spend around $75 or less on sneakers I find on sale (last years model) that were originally $150-ish.

My PF has improved greatly over the past few months as I've walked less and do the elliptical more.  I think this is because walking I'm wearing New Balance 840's and at the gym I'm wearing Saucony Guides.

I typically wear whatever New Balance's I find on Joes New Balance Outlet but it looks like I should start getting 860's as those are one of the only ones labeled stability.

I have a pair of Saucony Guide's I wear to the gym and they are good although Saucony stopped making my size.

Hoka's don't come in my size.

Anyone else in my shoes (no pun intended..well maybe a little bit)

I hope someone can help me, I have used New Balance 880s for like the last 6 years, I have probably gone through 10 pairs, they are my ride or dies, dream shoes never a problem, out of the box and absolute perfection each pair.

That is untill the v14, which has caused me so many issues, sore knees, twingy achilles, they do the same thing of forcing me inwards as when I tried Hoka Clifton. To say I am devestated is an understatement, I have a particularly wide foot (woman's 2E), have lost about 75 kilos but am still on the heavy side, and live in a country with not the best selection of wide fits available, my stash of the v13 are looking very worn.

1j7u047,RunningShoeGeeks,"Tarkine Autopilot - a roomer, more stable Clifton.","edit: \*roomier

Purchased in March 2025 for AUD$130 (US$80 !) under their ""Re-Run"" program.  
Perfect, as-new condition. Literally zero wear anywhere.

**Midsole**  
On initial wear, I actually thought this shoe was a dud. Like the person before returned it because it was.  
However, after walking around in it for a day or two, and taking it for an easy grass track session; the foam has really opened up.  
Not as compliant as the Rebel V4s with Fuelcell but still less immediate than the Triumph20s with PWRRUN+  
It might look like it has similarites to the Clifton but the midsole is far more responsive and resilient and doesn't just collapse and lay dead.

**Upper**  
Quite thick, not the most breathable.  
There is a lot of coverage of the upper with sealed vinyl-like material around the midfoot.  
Probably adds to the weight.  
Very secure, very comfortable.  
*Huge*¬†amounts of room in the toe box. I had issues with my Cliftons where my pinky toe would sometimes develop blisters in warm weather because the forefoot was too snug. I can barely get my toes to touch the sidewalls & roof in these.

**Outsole**  
Forefoot looks¬†*very*¬†similar to the Clifton, but has thicker rubber pads.  
Much more coverage around the heel,¬†*very*¬†usable for walking & everyday wear.  
Almost 3mm thick from rough measurement.

**Ride**  
This is a shoe that I wil happily wear all day and then go for a 10K run with mates in.  
The rocker is quite late, so it's stable for standing and the toe spring isn't annoying during all day wear.  
I'm not a heel-striker but the heel bevel is smooth and perfect for walking.  
The heel & forefoot flares are both significant, and really makes it one of the most stable neutral shoes that I have.

It's not the fastest shoe around, but I still managed to crack 85sec 400m x 9 repeats on tired legs.  
I have plenty of other shoes if I want to run faster than mara pace in.

I have already bought another pair for casual wear because of the funky colour edition.

If I were to go on holiday and need one pair of shoes to do travelling & touring jogs/runs in, this is it.

Personnally Hokas worked for me, and I have been wearing them daily, even at work with my professional work attire.
So I have been looking for supportive flats I could wear. 

Tried Naturalizer Maxwell flats. The insole did have nice arch support, but the toe box was too tight. I am finding pointed toe boxes trigger my PF symptoms. Returned.

I kept seeing ads for Vivaia shoes, and the comments seemed very positive. I really liked the look and feel of the square toe flat, but the arch support was minimal. Quality was just okay. For the price I felt I could get the same with a pair of Skechers. Returned.

Birkenstocks Tracy Mary Jane flats. I wasn't sure at first. Definitely had good arch support, rubbed a bit across the top, but that eased within a day. I was able to wear them a whole day with no PF pain. Ordering more in other colors. Not fancy, but they look better with slacks than my Hokas.

1j76x8i,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Shoes similar to ASICS Kayanos 29?,"I am so sick of spending money over the years on shoes that do not work for me. I always wore asics - GTs, Novablasts and Kayanos. I moved back to Kayanos from Novablasts as I need a stability shoe for overpronation and the neutral shoe started causing tendinitis as well as plantar. I had the 28s before (and 22s before that) but hated the 28s. I got the 29s and they worked great for me, I even ran my first marathon in them and put almost 800km into them and they‚Äôre still actually not too bad (but retired to walking!). I then got the 30s and they are just as bad if not worse than the 28s. I have blisters all along the inside of my foot and they appear at anything over 6km. They don‚Äôt feel as stable and there is absolutely no grip on a wet day.

I took a brief hiatus from asics a couple of years ago and bought Hokas. Worst idea ever. They absolutely wrecked my feet. I got the 29s then and they were the best thing ever.

Long story short, are there any shoes out there with the same fit, support and feel as the 29s in order to save me from injuries and save my bank account from trial and error on lots of different brands.

Side note: I wear good socks (usually feetures or balega) but nothing saved me losing toe nails at the marathon! I‚Äôve been gait analysed and know that because of the level of overpronation it has to be a stability shoe so I need to sacrifice a faster more responsive shoe for stability",2025-03-09 12:48:09+00:00,2,5

I also highlight my desire to restore natural strength and function of my feet with wide toe box/zero drop/barefoot type shoes and barefoot walking. 

General consensus seems to be that due to my hypermobility, more supportive shoes might be necessary. It was described to me as something like since my ligaments are so loose and flexible, I might not be able to strengthen my natural foot function fully and maintain a proper arch to be able to be successful with more barefoot style shoes. 

I have an overpronated gait and my knees turn inwards a bit when I walk, though I don‚Äôt have flat feet. I was born with hip dysplasia and was kept in a Pavlik cast for the first 6 months of my life. I also have Bertolottis syndrome, where my L5 vertebrae is fused to my sacrum on the right side. I had super painful plantar fasciitis a while ago that has mostly gone away since using the insoles the podiatrist gave me. I‚Äôm still working on strengthening my body, particularly  my glutes, hip abductors, and core. 

I just can‚Äôt find the perfect shoes for me. I usually use vibrum 5 finger toe shoes in the gym. I‚Äôve tried all of the Topos and Altra shoe styles and settled on Topos Terraventure and Altra Olympia, but after wearing them extensively for two years now they don‚Äôt feel right either.

I have officially signed up for my first marathon and am looking to add a second pair of sneakers to my rotation for training. Right now I am wearing Hoka Clifton 9 for all my runs and have zero complaints.

1j6b3tm,sesamoid,Sesamoid fracture,"Hi Everyone

I've had quite a long journey with my I injury and just wanted to seek some advice or see if anyone else has had a similar journey.

I first had some pain on a run in Januaey 2024, rested it for a few weeks and then returned to sport which was hight impacting on the feet. Over the space of a few months I had an xray, mri and then ct scan with finally picked up a fracture in late March. It was a mildy displaced comminuted fracture. I was relatively pain free by April and my doctor told me to get rid of the moon boot and if it didn't hurt I should be OK. At the time I didn't realize this wasn't great advice.

By July I started a small amount of running again but by the end of July I started having pain again. I got sent for another scan which said there was some early bone bridging but the majority was un-united. My doctor at the time said carry on what your doing and we'll see how it is in December. I didn't like the advice so put myself in the boot and wore this August, September and October. The new doctor put me in hokas with a carbon plate.

I had another scan in December and the fracture was largely healed but I was still in pain. The doctor said give it another 6 weeks and hopefully the pain clears up, otherwise he can give me a cortisone injection.

Come to the middle of February I was still in pain which can be quite intense at times. I had an Mri which said the fracture was largely healed but there was still mild edema in the bone. The doctor has said let pain be the guide and it should clear up.

How on earth do I get rid of the mild edema in the bone? I'm so sick of being in pain and at bit of a loss as to what I do next. Has anyone been through similar?

Sorry for the long post any advice would be much appreciated.",2025-03-08 06:27:28+00:00,6,7

As the title says, any suggestions for stable neutral shoes? I‚Äôve seen the list from doctors of running but was interested in personal recommendations. The issue I‚Äôm currently experiencing is that the guide system in a lot of these stability shoes cause pain on the inside of my foot and aggravates my ankle as well. When I size up to get away from this issue I end up with a lot of play in the shoe which leads to other issues. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! 

I‚Äôve currently tried the following shoes:

- Asics Gel Kayano 29/30 half size up (best experience so far but shoe is heavy and my foot moves around a lot in the shoe)
- Asics GT 2000 12 half size up (okay until higher mileages but foot moves around a lot in the shoe)
- Brooks Glycerin 21 GTS Wide TTS (okay until higher mileage)
- Hoka Arahi 7 Wide TTS (terrible experience)

1j63y30,PlantarFasciitis,Shoe changes,"I upgraded my old Hoka Cliftons 9 to the Bondi 9. They feel the same but with added cushioning. Basically everything the Clifton‚Äôs didn‚Äôt have, these ones fixed. They‚Äôre not a wildly different shoe except maybe they require a little bit more calf work due to bullkiness

Now my question is, can you get seriously injured from just changing shoes? They‚Äôre helping my heel pain so much, I could even feel some recovery but I went 2 sizes large to fit orthotics and thick socks- maybe I went a bit too large

Anyhow, I also just got facet joint injections in my back. And I thought maybe a nerve issue travelled down to my leg but I have been in so much pain that I couldn‚Äôt walk. I missed work.
I thought my Calf or Achilles tendon got a tear, and severe cramps lasted 5 days straight. I still feel a line of cramps through hamstring, calf, Achilles, PF and rest of the foot.

Prior to this happening and in the same week as my back injections was the first time I wore the Bondi‚Äôs. It was at work, though it‚Äôs an office job so I didn‚Äôt walk all that much. I work hybrid but there are mandatory office days. 

Then I worked from home and didn‚Äôt wear them. It was only after that my leg flared up.

I also wore them in the weekend, and I was fine then but my cramps were very bad throughout this week. 

I feel a bit of pain now in the other leg too and I did wear them yesterday and today just because everything else hurts my heel. Is it actually possible so much cushioning actually injured my tendons and heels? I‚Äôm starting to think it‚Äôs the shoes but everything else hurts so much, especially now that everything is flared up.

How can this be? Or is it more likely the injections just hit a nerve. The shoes still feel so comfy. But I can imagine pain after say, a week wearing them right off. Not a day or 2 of some intermittent walking. Even then, I did not wear them all day. I have 2-3 pairs I rotate. I remember doing wild shoe changes that didn‚Äôt affect me at all even last autumn ( high to low drop) ",2025-03-07 23:50:37+00:00,0,11

1j61tmz,XXRunning,Change in drop - ball of foot burning?,"I have recently been told to change or add in another pair of shoes by my physio to something with more padding, due to recurrent shin pain (while of course doing calf strengthening and physio exercises and stretching and rolling and resting and all the things - not asking for advice on this part).

I have been running in ghosts for the last... 8 years and usually they are great for me. I have recently gotten a pair of saucony ride 18s, and previously tried hoka bondi 9.

With both of these new shoes, at about the 20 minute mark, I get burning under the ball of my foot. When I went back to the running store here which is the best one in our area for knowledge, they said with the bondis that they thought it was a toe box width issue so I tried the sauconys which seemed to be a bit wider.

I'm having the same issue with the saucony's and when I look at them vs. my ghosts there is no way they are narrower than the ghosts that don't give me this issue so I don't think the toebox is the problem.

The change in drop is 6mm between the shoes - Ghosts are 12 and Sauconys are 6 so this is reducing the drop but upping the cushion.

I guess I'm wondering if anyone else has had this issue changing drop height? And if it went away? I am going to give the new shoes 3 more runs to see if they break in a bit and I will talk to my physio this week to see if she has thoughts but thought I'd see if anyone else had this and ran through it!

I‚Äôve been using Altras for years but I haven‚Äôt been happy with newer models. I get lace bite sometimes, getting blisters recently and they‚Äôre just not durable. 

I went to a running store and tried several shoes. My favorite was probably the Hoka Bondi 9 in a D width, but they‚Äôre too narrow in the toe box. 

Paradigm 7 had great slip-in feel, but the Guiderails bother me. 

Torin 8 isn‚Äôt the best. Women‚Äôs 9 in B width was too tight. Men‚Äôs 7.5 Wide was humongous. Women‚Äôs 8.5 wide was too narrow along the medial side. It‚Äôs frustrating. 

I also liked the Novablast 5s a lot due to the upper fit. However, the sole is too soft for me and I felt like my feet were falling over in them. Would a stiff insole help remedy this?

1j5sm3a,AskRunningShoeGeeks,"Calf pain / strain and ""sinking"" heel shoes (not medical advice)","Hi all,

Probably a slightly odd question, but trying to work out the ""type"" of shoes I need to avoid. I seem to get on with a variety of different shoes, across a variety of drops and middle sole softness. A few examples I like.

On Cloud Monster Hyper  
New Balance SC Trainer V3  
Saucony Ride 17  
Vaporfly / Alfafly  
Endorphin Eite  
Original Hoka Rocket X  
On Cloud Stratus  
Plaid 1.5

As you can see, a mix of foams, rockers and heel drop.

However, in the past I bought some Hoka Mach 5 and it felt like I was sitting back in the heel when standing, with my toes pointing up. Basically felt like negative heel drop. They felt very odd to run in and calves ached. So I got rid.

My current long run shoe is the SC Trainer v3 which I find bouncy and propulsive. I fancied a non carbon plate daily, as I find the Ride 17 a bit hard at times and makes my feet sore. So I decided to get the NB Rebel V4. Seemed like a good match, on paper.

However, I put in on and immediately felt the same issue as the Mach 5, like I was almost tipping backwards. All weight in the heel and toes not feeling grounded.

Went for a short run and pulled my calf within in a mile. That was 3 weeks ago. Calf not right, but on the mend and I thought I'd try them again in case it was just bad luck that day and not related. Again, within half a mile my calf hurt so I stopped, walked home and put in the Rides. All good if harsh.

Disappointing, but looks like not for me. But as I look for shoes in the future, what is it about the Mach 5 and Rebel 4 that makes all the weight seem in the heel?

I was thinking too low drop, but the Rocket is fine at 5mm. Then I thought soft foam, but the Plaid 1.5 is like cake it is so spongy. The vaporfly and alfa fly are fine too.

Maybe rocker style, but the Elite is an agressive rocker and no issue for the marathon.

So I am not looking for shoee recommendations so much as what ""type"" are the Mach 5 and Rebel so I can avoid this toes in the air, negative drop 'feeling'.

Sorry if a slightly odd question, but want to avoid more expensive mistakes. If it helps, I am around 61K, 170cm and heel striker.

Does anyone know why the Hoka Clifton 9 is causing so much pain? Is it because I got used to the 8mm stack height of the NewBalance and the Hoka Clifton is 5mm? Is Clifton more supportive than my other models so with my custom orthotics, it was just way too supportive?

1j5aer2,Hoka,women's Bondi 7 questioning authenticity,"Well  here's my7 Bondi 7  dilemma.

¬†Background: As you probably know they discontinued Bondi 7 a¬†few years ago, but brought it back (recently?) in a few limited colors. I am interested in the black-and-white version which is not one that was renewed.

Anyway, a new Bondi7¬† showed up on eBay in my women‚Äôs size.. the look of it - in terms of the give/stiffness seems spot on. But there are three possible weird things:

1. The innersole, though it says Hoka, is not the deep blue color, nor does it have the words ortholite and the indentations with numbers, etc.¬†(I will not use the inner sole, but my own orthotics, anyway).
2. The tag is not the same dimensions as other Bondi 7 tags I have ..also it says 10W, and I am not used to seeing the W in Hoka  women‚Äôs shoes.(W stands for medium width for women. D is wide for women‚Äôs shoes, When nothing is written, it implies medium). In the 3 pair of Bondi 7 I had in the past, there was never a W.
3. Bondi 7‚Äôs have ventilation holes on the platform,¬† and all my previous ones have ONE ventilation hole that is larger than the rest. On this purchased model, that is not the case.(Ventilation hole is there in photo of left shoe, almost looking like a square).

I contacted Hoka customer service. They knew way less about any of this than I did, but said they‚Äôd try to get more info. Guy never called back. He  offered  one possible tidbit: he thought when they discontinued Bondi 7, the customers base was so irate that when they brought the shoes back,  it was perhaps a rush job. He thought maybe that's why these might have these different variables. I'm not so sure.

Thoughts?

These shoes are $100, vs. others new online for about $160, but as I said, this color configuration doesn‚Äôt exist now.

I had an another go at getting it out and did get it out. All seemed well for a few months, then I started to notice slight pain in my metatarsal foot areas. It got more and more painful, but again I pushed through it as I needed to work. I visited the podiatrist again who strapped my feet and told be it would get better. It didn‚Äôt. I tried metatarsalgia cushions and in the end bought hoka‚Äôs. The pain just increased. I rested a bit over Christmas, but unfortunately this didn‚Äôt help.

1j53fdh,AskRunningShoeGeeks,New Running Shoe Recommendation - Coming from New Balance 1080v13,"Hello! New to the group but have been an avid runner for awhile. I‚Äôm currently looking for new all around running shoe recommendations. I previously wore Hoka Clifton 9s and I thought they were fine, but switched over to the New Balance 1080v13 but they‚Äôre approaching their mileage. I‚Äôm running marathons and what not liked the cushion in the 1080s but I‚Äôm interested in trying something maybe a little more reactive? I‚Äôve been hearing a lot about the ASICS Super Blast 2 and was thinking about giving those a shot, but would love to get others opinions.",2025-03-06 19:13:11+00:00,5,8
1j53ct9,beginnerrunning,Should shin splints be this bad??,"I'm new-ish to running. I've done a ton of sports over the years and I know what feeling sore from exercise is like but man, the shin splints while running are killing me. I'm 29F, weigh 220lb, and 5'5.

  
I've gone on a few runs, and most of the time as soon as I start jogging my shins are killing me, but as soon as I take a walking break they're fine. I tried especially hard today to work on my form (not heel striking) and work on slowing things down, and the shin splints came about 5 seconds after I started jogging for the first interval, and then for the rest of the intervals they were pretty much immediate. Can I call this progress?? That they started after 5 seconds of jogging?? It's just frustrating because I feel like I can't even run properly and I feel dumb for it. 

  
I've tried massaging and stretching and it doesn't seem to help. Currently running 3-4 days a week, a 15-18 min mile (thats including my warm up and cool down so probably closer to 15?), and running 1.5-1.7 miles in 30 ish minutes. Obviously I'm working on the weight loss but I really want to run. My pace is fine as far as being able to hold a conversation goes, but my shins are killing me even if I'm going so slow that my fast walking speed is about the same as my running. I'm wearing new Hokas from a running store, and I think I'm landing midfoot for my strike.

  
Also, are there any subs for exercising/running when overweight? 

  
Thanks

1j4mh8i,RunningShoeGeeks,Saucony Triumph 22 510 mile review,"‚Ä¢	Shoe Model & Size: - Saucony Triumph 22 11.5 US Men‚Äôs

‚Ä¢	Fit/Comfort Notes:¬†I have fairly flat feet and have worn arch supports in the past. These shoes fit me perfectly right out of the box, and were much more comfortable without insoles than with. My feet are also pretty wide and I have struggled with other brands to get shoes that are an appropriate width (Nike in particular) These are great for my feet and I occasionally wear them to work because they‚Äôre so comfortable. 

‚Ä¢	Use Case:¬†Daily Trainer (not race shoe)

‚Ä¢	Distance Ran:¬†510 miles

‚Ä¢	Reason For Buying:¬†I wanted a stiffer shoe after exclusively running in Hokas. When my last pair got shredded I decided to change it up and found these to be the most comfortable for my gait right out of the box. 

‚Ä¢	Profile: 5‚Äô9, 153, Heel/Mid Striker. Run about 35 MPW around 7:40 min/mile

‚Ä¢	Pros: These are by far the most durable shoes I‚Äôve ever worn. 500 miles in and there is only some minor wear on the soles. They still are plenty springy and comfortable, and feel pretty close to how they did when I purchased them. They have withstood rain and snow with no trouble. I suspect they‚Äôre good for at least another 200 miles. They are fairly versatile as well - I have run long distances (17+ mi) in them and found the extra cushioning to be very useful. However, when training for races they still feel responsive enough to make fast paces feel comfortable.

‚Ä¢	Cons: Can feel a bit soggy when running at race pace. I would definitely never wear them for an actual race. 

‚Ä¢	Shoe comparisons:  
	‚ÅÉ	Hoka Clifton - The durability difference between these two is not even close - he soles on my Hokas were completely worn after 230 miles. The Hoka‚Äôs were comfortable but lacked the springiness/responsiveness of the Triumphs. 
	‚ÅÉ	Brooks Glycerin GTS - I ran a couple times in these and found them to be much too stiff for my liking right out of the gate. 
	‚ÅÉ	Saucony Endorphin Pro 3 - Obviously a completely different shoe. I train in the Triumphs and race in the Endorphins and find that the transition is a good fit for me. These have a much lighter weight and provide much more bounce due to the carbon plate. 
	‚ÅÉ	Saucony Triumph 21 - I recently bought these to see if they‚Äôd be a suitable replacement for the 22‚Äôs and found them to be much too stiff for my liking. There is a noticeable increase in cushion in the 22, especially in the heel. I suppose for some this could make the 22 feel clunky, but I prefer it to the 21. 

TL;DR: Barring any unforeseen changes, I will probably never buy another training shoe again! These shoes rock and have given me the most bang for my buck of any shoe I‚Äôve worn.",2025-03-06 03:39:02+00:00,72,17

This is my first time posting on this sub. I've seen a lot of complaints about the Arahi 7, but not this specific answer so thought I would ask...

I loved my Arahi 6s like I never loved a shoe, but it's time for new ones. I tried the 7s on and they felt narrow around the pinky toe and tight at the heel in store but seemed to fit around the big toe so I bought them. Ran 2 easy miles to get comfortable with them this morning and really hated the way the pinky side and heel felt - way worse than expected. 

So for those of you who got the 7s and didn't love them initially, did you keep them? And did they start to feel better? As in, did they wear in eventually? I know I can't return them and don't really have the budget to just buy another pair of shoes immediately if I don't need to, but of course don't want to risk injuring myself either.

1j3pira,FootFunction,How do I prolong the lifespan of my toe?,"Hi everyone, 

I (38F) was recently diagnosed with Hallux Limitus in my right foot and I'm looking for some general advice on how to prolong the lifespan of the joint. 

**Backstory:** I've had a small bunion on that foot since I was 18, having started ballet at age 3. It's never caused me any pain, but I've had a more limited range of motion in that toe since I was about 25. 

**Added bonus:** The very same foot has been through quite a lot of trauma. After multiple ankle sprains over a 20 year period, I had a successful triple ligament repair in 2016. The ankle joint has been fine since but I suspect I may face some issues down the road as things start to wear and tear, which is why I'm quite worried about the Hallux L on the same foot. 

I'm only 38 so I'd love to do everything I can to protect my foot. Does anyone who's been dealing with this issue for a long time have any advice? I'd love to hear the dos and don'ts or the shoulda/woulda/couldas in hindsight. 

**Surgery:**

* Is there anything I should do at this stage to prolong the life of the joint? 
* Is there any merit in having bunion surgery + cheilectomy to allow the joint to be as fully functional again as possible? (Or has that ship sailed?) 

**Exercise - I'm not a runner so all good on that front:**  

* I'm a yogi but now realising just how much I have to flex my foot (planks, downward dogs, etc). Should I switch to pilates or do you think some movement like is okay if just 1-2 times per week?
* I was looking to get back into some dance - specifically Modern/Horton. Should I not? It's bare foot and there would be some flexing/pointing of the toe. 
* Are there any exercises whether for the foot or related (knee/hip etc) that help?

**Lifestyle:** 

* I'm probably about 40lbs overweight. Should I make a concerted effort to lose this weight to reduce load on the joint? Is there very important? (I mean, yes, I should lose it anyway but thought I'd ask lol - please be kind!)
* Shoes - I'm aware I need to commit to rocker/cushioned shoes - hello Hokas and Birkenstocks. I'm curious though, what on earth do you wear if you work in a very corporate/stylish environment? Can I get away with ballet flats just around the office once I get there?

Thank you in advance for your kind guidance!

1j3h3z4,Hoka,Grounds for filing a warranty claim? Mach6 less than 90 days old with less than 100 treadmill only miles. Decal peeling off.,"I bought these Mach6s from Fleetfeet in early December. However, this Fleetfeet did not have the size and color I wanted, so they did indeed purchase them from Hoka, and then I picked them up from the Fleetfeet once they arrived.

These shoes have been only used on the treadmill and have less than 100 miles on them (the treadmill is literally the only surface these shoes have touched - I wear a different pair of shoes and put on these Hokas while sitting on the edge on the treadmill). When I am not using them, they sit on a shelf in my closet. Somehow, the outer decal on the right shoe is starting to peel. While this doesn‚Äôt impact performance, I think it is certainly a craftsmanship issue which is listed on their site as a valid reason for a warranty claim. 

Given the fact that I personally did not purchase these from Hoka (Fleetfeet did, though), will I have to pay return shipping? And if I do, does anyone know around how much it‚Äôd cost? (I reside in the US). Should I just dab some superglue and call it a day instead of dealing with this?

TLDR; lightly used and recently purchased Mach6 have a clear craftsmanship issue, but I am wondering if it‚Äôs worth the hassle and potential cost to file a warranty claim or either fix the issue myself/ignore it.

Unfortunately, Hoka decided to discontinue this shoe and I have been looking for some new line-ups. Currently, in rotation I have a casual carbon-plated trainer (a niche brand Xstep 260X 2.0). They are firm, responsive, and I have decided to wear them for upcoming Rotterdam Marathon; but looking for some fun all rounder for trainings and for future runs (e.g., half)

For stat, I am a tiny Asian woman 1.55m around 52kg. Proportionally, the sizing of my feets (36 wide/flat) makes it IMPOSSIBLE to find/try running shoes in the Netherlands‚Ä¶

-Neutral Runner
-Heel Striker 
-Cadence: 175+ (training for higher)
-Base/Easy: 5:45 min/km
-Threshold: 4:29 min/km
If not training for Marathon, the run will be ranging between 5:10-5:40 min/km depending on distance.

Again, looking for some fun options for all-around trainers! Based on some testing, I have narrowed down to these 4. I know they are very different shoes, but would highly appreciate some advice :)

‚Ä¢Mach 6: I had the opportunity to test run 10 km with them but with size 37. Not as cushioning as Mach 5 and felt clumsy? But can be a backup option as Mach 5 works very well for me..

‚Ä¢Mach X2: Have not really run with it, but the fit was okay. I read a lot of reviews about the bloody heel, but personally was not very concerned (maybe too naive..) I might get another chance to test them on a 10k run (in 2 weeks) but will be testing in half size larger‚Ä¶

‚Ä¢Puma Deviate Nitro 3: Just tried them on in store today! (again one size larger 37) but immediately loving the hug and the bounce/energy from the soles! As Puma does not offer 36.5, I have the concern for my ‚Äòwide mid-foot‚Äô, but 37 seems working well width-wise ü§î The shopper told me it was nylon plate and it‚Äôs more durable. TG, I did more research  when coming back home. Hence, was curious about the durability of Puma Nitro with carbon plates.

‚Ä¢ASICS Superblast 2: Not a super big fan of ASICS (no hate), ran my first marathon with Nimbus 24 (5.5)‚Ä¶oh well just bought it because the shoppers said it was good for first-time runner. It was very snug in both length and width - blisters, black toe nails, pain in calfs‚Ä¶- however, I did try SB2 (again not the correct size) in stores and feel nice. Heard a lot of good reviews on the durability and versatility and would consider as an option!

Of course, feel free to share other options/brands ;) However, because of my ‚Äúweird‚Äù sizing a lot of companies do not offer the half sizing options (e.g., Saucony) or the correct arch support - often very weird bump feeling near inner heels (e.g., NB Rebel v4) ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

1j2qdn6,RunningShoeGeeks,Topo Cyclone 2: My thoughts after 800km,"Just yesterday I finally reached 800kms, after buying them in July 2023. Me: M21, 54kg, 167cm. Mostly racing HM (\~1:25 PB), sometimes Marathons (\~3:05 PB).

# Usage

I bought them as a replacement for my daily trainers, which at that time were Hoka Mach 5s. This is also how I used them: Mostly easy runs, some longer, some quicker, but nothing too special. My longest run in them was around 21kms and my fastest a 5k race; the average pace in them over the 800km is 5:39/km.

# Fit

I usually wear EU42 in most brands, sometimes even 42.5 if they are tight in the forefoot. The Cyclone is a very wide and accomodating shoe and I should have sized down to 41.5.

I sometimes have problems with my achilles in some shoes and usually wear orthopedic insoles; here I did not have to do that because of the special insoles by Topo and I never had any problem with it.

# Performance

I feel like the Cyclone 2 performed pretty well as a daily trainer. Straight out of the box, I found them not too bouncy and not too much fun, but they were a stable shoe in my rotation that I could rely on. Actually, maybe it was good that they were not inviting me to go too fast.

The ride did not change much over time (at least I can't really tell) and they did not bottom out. I never had any issues with them feeling more lifeless than usual ;)

In the cases were I did speed up, they also served me very well. They are lightweight and feel pretty fast, minus a carbon (stiff) plate.

In my longest run in them I did notice the ""low"" stackheight afterwards. My feet felt more beaten up than in other shoes, but I don't think they are made for this anyway and they certainly did not hold me back.

# How they held up

The upper held up fine! The mid- and outsole look a bit more run down, as is expected. The outsole held up until 700kms, that was when I started to run on foam (at least on the lateral side).

What I just noticed is that on the left shoe, the upper has dissolved(?) a bit. Probably the result of the shoe being to large for me, so it bent more than usual in that spot.

I retired them now due to the outsole rubber dissolving at the front / middle and them being slippery when not on pavement.

The rubber at the heel is still as new, so I will get some more time out of them when walking.

# Would I buy them again?

No, but that is because I don't buy shoes twice, unless they are really something special ;)

I think for their relaitvely low price, they are a pretty versatile and reliable shoe with great value. Now I will use them as my regular walking shoes until my next daily trainer is retired.

# Comparisons

* Hoka Mach 5: The Mach 5 is way more bouncy and fun; but I found it bottomed out after \~500kms. The Cyclones are much more comfortable to wear though.

* Evo SL: Same deal as with the Mach 5: Evo Sl = fun; Cyclone = comfortable to wear.

* New Balance Rebel v4: I feel like the Rebel is actually relatively close to the Cyclone. This will be my replacement.

* Hoka Mach 6: Also the same deal as with the Mach 5.

* Asics Novablast 3: Overall kinda similar, but for me the Novablasts felt worse in all regards. They were not very comfortable or versatile and I choose to sell them pretty quick. Cyclone all the way!

1j2kxw2,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Race Day Shoe Recommendations,"Hey guys, I'm looking for some recommendations (model and potentially size) as the market has shifted so far since the last time I've purchased any race day shoes and since everyone's experience is different, I keep seeing conflicting opinions on almost every popular shoe.

My race trainers up until now have been Nike Tempo Next%.

Despite others' experiences with them, they have been the perfect race day shoes for me and have been my go-to race day shoes since my first marathon. The problem is they're on their way out and before I must retire them, I want a suitable replacement that I could potentially use for my next marathon in a months time. I also have a pair of Alphafly v1s which I've done about 160km in since purchase, which I love, but they cause heavy blisters within 10k under both my arches so I'm hesistant to dust them off. I am, however, open to trying any shoes even if they're nowhere near the same as the Next%s

I've run a few marathons over the years, PBs for FM, HM, 5k are 3:16, 1:31 and (00:)18:30 , I have mild overpronation but nothing has ever been of major concern on race days, I'm a heelstriker and my arches are on the lower side. I am currently doing S&C to help with this though. My easy pace is from about 5:05/km and slower.

My daily trainer history in reverse chronological order (with total mileage) as follows, I do (and have done) every run in these and don't have dedicated trainers for different workout types. I don't have a rotation and every pair of shoes before my current are retired.

* **Current:** Brooks Adrenaline 23 2E UK-9.5 (300km as of today)
   * No issues with these trainers
* Brooks Adrenaline 24 D UK-9.5 (60k)
   * Running <10k but from running 10k+ I had severe blisters on the front side at the bottom of both my arches. These were returned to Brooks under their Run Happy Guarantee after running about 60k total (I *really* wanted the trainers to work)
* Asics GT-2000 10 D UK-9.5 (940km)
   * Embarassingly, I never realised there were standard width and never really questioned any issues. This influenced the D purchase of the Brooks Ad24...
   * Running 10k+ resulted in blisters in both pinky toes, I was none the wiser and since blisters never actually stopped me from running, I didn't think much more of it
* Hoka Clifton 8 2E UK-9.5 (1300km)
* Asics GT-2000 9 (800km)
* Asics GT-2000 7 (800km)

I currently have a pair of Adidas Adios Pro 4 size UK10 otw but have refrained from ordering anything else because virtually nowhere else has a supershoe return policy that I can find.

Hopefully this is enough information, I'm happy to share anything else that might help!

1j2fhlj,hiking,Hiking shoe minefield - help!,"Hello! As the title suggests I'm deep in research and somehow getting more lost. I spent a day going around different stores, trying shoes on, and I'm still none the wiser.

I hike long distances regularly (10-20miles) and have signed up to a 100km walk (over 2 days) later this Spring. I need to find a pair of shoes soon so I can trial them with plenty of time.

I prefer a shoe/trainer in this instance as trying to cut down the weight, but wary of going for a pure trail running shoe as I want the protection that comes with the hiker versions. I'm often hiking over mixed terrain, but nothing too scrambley and generally on well-trodden paths. I don't often carry too much weight other than a light day pack, and even with the 2 day/100km walk there's luggage forwarding for overnight stuff, so I still won't have more than a day pack.

I'm currently hiking in Adidas Terrex Trailmaker GTX. They've always been fine but I'm sure if I can do better as I feel like there are better quality shoes out there. My feet are on the wider side though so I don't want anything that's going to compress my toes. I've looked at things like Keen and Merrell. Merrell Moab 3 and Moab Speed 2 seemed ok, although I've read a lot of folk saying the quality has gone down and to avoid them, so, I'm slightly off them now. The Keen Targhee III felt great in the toebox, but as soon as I started walking they felt as though they were making me pronate too much, so they're out. I looked at Hoka but the reviews on their own site aren't good and put me off. Altra looks good but I'm concerned about making the shift to zero heel-to-toe drop when I've only got 3 months before the big walk.

Does anyone have any advice on what I should try next please?",2025-03-03 10:11:17+00:00,1,4
1j28iwp,sesamoid,Some Relief,"This is my first time posting here but I wanted to share what has been working for me in relieving my pain! C:

I (24M) was diagnosed with sesamoiditis about two months ago and it felt hopeless, like nothing could make me feel better. I did a steroid shot and completely offloaded as much as I could for three weeks. None of it helped.

-I started using toe spreaders for 10-45min a night, gently flexing my foot as I wore them. The first time I wore them I could feel the muscles in my feet trying to release, kinda like when you relax your back after a long day and it kinda hurts but also feels good!

-I bought Hoka Ora recovery mules and they are the only house slipper I‚Äôve found that can support my foot!!

-I have extremely high arches which makes my sesamoiditis worse as my sesamoiditis bones basically just grind into the ground, so cushion in the ball of my foot is key as well. 

-Massaging my foot in every are EXCEPT the sesamoiditis!!! Really digging in on the arches and right under the ball of the foot.

-Deep tissue massage on calf muscles. If you‚Äôve got someone to help you out with this then it‚Äôs so much better but you can use massage devices too. 

-I got a shower stool. After working all day and coming home to take a hot shower, I noticed my feet hurt worse afterwards. I got a shower stool and that stopped happening ü§∑

I‚Äôm not a doctor and YMMV but these are just things that I‚Äôve found help my pain.

I‚Äôve been a loyal **Hoka** user for a long time and recently got a pair of **Tecton X3** from Sportshoes. However, after only about **150 km (93 miles)** of use, I noticed **symmetrical fabric tearing on both shoes**.

1j0d5sp,RunningShoeGeeks,Rebel 4 915km review/Mach 6 first impression,"I retired my Rebel 4s after 915km, here‚Äôs my thoughts. 

I ran in v2 and v3 and absolutely loved both of these versions. Great, speedy shoes with ground contact but cushy enough which made this shoe super versatile for me. Now for the version 4 - I had super high expectations. 

Rebel 4 is great by all means but its a slight downgrade from previous versions for me. Why? It is more cushioned but at the same time felt less bouncy. It also gets noticeable flatter around 600km and I dont remember this feeling with previous versions this early. I am a lightweight runner tho so I rarely retire shoes earlier than 700-800km. 

Also the way they fit is odd because its short in lenght I think. I wanted to size up but I was Swimming in bigger size so went with my regular size and I would get feeling of sore big toes when I would run over 15km so I kept my runs in these below this distance. Overall it is still a Great shoe that I can only recommend but having said that imo previous Rebel versions were better. 

I just did my first run in Mach 6 which replaced Rebels and I am impressed. I had Rincon 3 in 2022 and I absolutely hated that shoe so Hoka was a no no for me for some time. After reading reviews I thought that Mach 6 could actually work for me.. additionally it was on sale for around 95 ‚Ç¨ and ya it  does for me! 

First impression is Great - lightweight, bouncy, cushy, responsive, comfy. I did some warm up and cool down kms today and also 600m reps around 4:00/km (15km in total) It felt responsive at fast segments but protective enough at slower pace. 

This shoe can definitely be your daily and/or tempo shoe as it is very versatile. I need to get more runs in Mach 6 but I have a feeling I will like this one tiny bit more than Rebel 4! ",2025-02-28 17:27:00+00:00,150,63

* **Age/Gender:** Late 30s, Male
* **Height/Weight:** 6'2"", \~350 lbs (morbidly obese)
* **Medications:** Ibuprofen, Naproxen (as needed, but they don‚Äôt help much)
* **Smoking/Drinking:** Non-smoker, occasional drinker
* **Medical History:** Chronic Achilles tendonitis in both ankles due to bone spurs; torn left Achilles (surgically repaired with great results), chronic pain in the right Achilles

**Main Issue:**  
For years, I‚Äôve dealt with Achilles tendonitis in both ankles due to bone spurs on my heels irritating the tendon. I tore my **left** Achilles over a year ago, had surgery, and now have **zero pain or discomfort** in that ankle. However, my **right** ankle is now unbearable.

Every step I take causes **sharp pain in the back of my heel**, right where the Achilles meets the bone. It‚Äôs **tender to the touch** and never improves. I‚Äôve tried:

* **Footwear:** HOKAs, On Clouds
* **Supports:** Neoprene sleeves, custom inserts, orthotics
* **Medications:** Voltaren gel, ibuprofen, naproxen (minimal to no relief)
* **Therapies:** Physical therapy, stretching

Nothing has helped, and walking is becoming **increasingly difficult and limiting** my life.

I recently went back to my **podiatrist** to request surgery since my left ankle is perfect post-op, but he refused, saying to just keep doing PT and stretching‚Äîwhich hasn‚Äôt worked. His only other suggestion was to **wear a walking boot periodically** to let it ‚Äúcalm down.‚Äù

I also noticed I‚Äôve started **leaning on the outside of my foot** while walking, likely to avoid pain.

**Looking for advice on:**

1. **Pain relief options** (braces, different treatments, alternative therapies)
2. **Should I push harder for surgery?** My left ankle responded so well, and I‚Äôm struggling with daily activities.
3. **Any other approaches that have worked for chronic Achilles issues?**

1j07xij,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Best running shoes for your back?,"I recently got the 'running bug' for the first time in my life... after years of weight training and avoiding cardio.

Unfortunately a month later I got debilitating back pain which led to an MRI and a discovery of Degenerative Disc Disease in my lower back (L3-L4 and S1-S2 if anyone is interested).

Not saying this is connected but when I was a weight lifter I would say running is a devils sport and exclaim that it is actually bad for you... coincidentally all this happened when I just started running, ha!

Anyway, the disc was bulging and impinging on a nerve which was the worst part, but now its back to 'normal' levels of back pain, it's just a case of adapting my lifestyle to the knowledge I now have that at 29 years old I have DDD and hoping to not accelerate the degeneration more than necessary.

Is there a type of running trainer I could buy to best protect my joints and my back in particular? I know that high intensity workouts in general are not advised, or road runs where you are slapping your foot down on the hard ground...

1j041l1,trailrunning,Trail Shoes suggestions after ankle sprain,"**Hello, Trail runners!**

Back in January, I suffered a moderate ankle sprain while running on rocky terrain. I suspect the main culprit was my ASICS Trabuco Max 3, which I initially chose for their comfort but later found lacking in ground feel and proprioception on technical trails. Before that, I was using the HOKA Speedgoat 5, but they gave me persistent blisters under my foot.

Since the injury, I‚Äôve fully recovered and completed a rehab program focused on proprioception and strengthening exercises. However, my ankle remains more susceptible to rolling, and I‚Äôve experienced multiple minor twists‚Äîespecially on rocky and sandy trails, which are my main training grounds. My physiotherapist warned me that without proper reinforcement work, the risk of re-spraining remains high. This has also impacted my confidence, particularly on technical descents.

Given this, I‚Äôm looking to replace my Trabuco Max 3. They feel a bit high off the ground, which affects my ability to react to the terrain. I‚Äôm a big fan of ASICS‚ÄîI‚Äôve had both the Novablast 3 and 4 for road running, and they fit my feet perfectly in size 44 EU. I‚Äôve read some positive reviews about the Gel-Trabuco 12 regarding ankle stability‚Äîcan anyone confirm if that‚Äôs true?

I‚Äôd also love to hear any other recommendations for stable, low-profile trail shoes!

1izmyy1,AskRunningShoeGeeks,"Trail, road or hybrid shoes?","**TL;DR** \- what type of shoes would be the best for not a super technical trail (provided pictures that feel like what I run through) that is also mixed with 10-20% roads (not always)? - I also already own a pair of Hoka Speedgoat 5 shoes.

Hello!

When I first started running, I mostly used very cheap trainers‚Äîwhatever felt comfortable. Living in the countryside among beautiful forests, I eventually decided to stop running on roads and do more off-road running. As I built up my distance to 5 and then 10k, I decided to purchase my first proper pair of trainers.

After trying on multiple shoes, I went with the Hoka Speedgoat 5. They worked well on snow, mud, roots, downhill, anything I really needed.

Later, I got a bit bored and wanted to mix my track up as running the same thing over and over got boring for me. I also go for a run with friends here and there. And boom, suddenly there were some road segments. They were not very long, I would say 2km per run max, but usually under 1km. That short road segment is not my only issue, I would like to do more road here and there - while joining a friend, for instance - we are still not looking for full road, but maybe 20-35% of my runs would be roads. Some of my trails are not very technical, especially when the weather is nice - I run on fairly nice forest paths or through a meadow where many people pass and so the paths are fairly comfortable, omitting the few steep downhills I do to avoid extra road running.

And all that made me want to get an extra pair of trainers. At first, I thought of getting a pair of road shoes as I already own a pair of solid trail shoes and this would allow me to choose based on the track, BUT! I still do so much more offroad running than road running, so I felt like that was not the perfect answer - I cannot think of a time I would do a 100% road run.

I ended up looking at some hybrids such as Hoka Challenger 7 since I liked my Speedgoats 5, but I am not so sure that is the correct answer. You do not have to recommend specific shoes as I know that is quite subjective (but feel free to!), but I would like to know what type of shoe you'd go with?

I am not getting rid of my old Hokas just yet, so I have that. I am also submitting some pictures of how various segments I run look like - keep in mind there are not actual pictures I took, but just something I found that is quite close and what I would say reminded me of my track - I am including only the notable part, one steep downhill through the forest that is maybe 100m is not included etc., I am also obviously not including pictures of actual roads.

I'm very much a beginner and don't have any notable shoe preferences yet. I went to a running shoe store and the guy told me l have high arches, a high instep, supination, and a slightly wide foot (not technically wide but close, especially depending on shoe). I am also prone to peroneal tendonitis, which is why I haven't stuck with running in the past.

I am a 6.5 women's (one foot is a 6). Wide shoes are comfortable but end up being too wide in the heel and I get a lot of heel slippage, particularly with the smaller foot. One last thing to note is that if I end up hating running, I would like to be able to use the shoes as a walking shoe.

I tried on a lot today, but got a bit overwhelmed after trying on so many (easily over a dozen) and the finalists are below.

Brooks Glycerin 5 - liked the cushion, snug in in toe box
Hoka Bondi 9 - good cushion, snug in toe box thrown off by height
Hoka Clifton 9 - might have been a smidge tight in toe box
Hoka Gaviota 5 - fit the best in toe box but did not seem to have as much cushion

Which of the above would you recommend given my situation? If I try them on again, is there something specific I should be looking for to make the final decision? I'm kind of lost but eager to get started. Thank you!

1iyc9j7,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Flat/Wide Feet Shoe Recommendation,"Hi everyone,

New to this group and wanted to reach out for a question on shoes for my wide and flat feet. I am a true size 10.5 but with I usually need a wide fit and usually a square toe box otherwise my feet feel suffocated. I went to marathon sports and did an assessment and my feet are basically 95th percentile in flat, literally no arch. 

I‚Äôve had good success the last 3 years with the ASICS GT-2000? I‚Äôve gone through 2 pairs of them, getting me through a half marathon and many 5ks and other workouts.  

I wanted to try a different shoe but did not know what shoe would be the best recommendation. I remember trying on Hokas and did not like how my heel fit. Before ASICS I was always Brooks Adrenalines but like the support more with the GT-2000. I recently saw the Noosa Tri 16s and was curious if those might be a good fit. 

On average (when the weather is nicer) I will run between 8-15 miles a week and also do F45 classes 3-4x/week. 

Should I get a daily trainer or a race shoe?",2025-02-26 01:54:04+00:00,1,3
1iy90v9,trailrunning,Need advice: trail shoes for muddy ultra races,"I'm looking for recommendations on race shoes for **Lofoten Ultra Trail (48km)** and **Laugavegur (55km)**‚Äîboth likely to be **muddy and wet**. And they will be my first races longer than road marathon too.

My all time favourite trail shoes are **Salomon Speedcross 4**, which I absolutely love for their grip‚ÄîI‚Äôd trade speed for confidence, besides that they are extremely comfortable for me. I also rotate some Nikes, but they‚Äôre more suited for dry, light trails. And Hoka Mafate Speed 4 - I use them, but they are a bit wider than I like.

For these ultras, I need something that: has great grip (mud, wet rocks, and soft ground), doesn‚Äôt turn into a brick when soaked, feels secure and stable over long distances, preferably lighter overall than Speedcross.

I‚Äôm considering Salomon, Adidas,  and NNormal, but I‚Äôm unsure about their grip. Tried Norda too, also uncomfortable wide but the upper is nice.

1ixwfo3,RunningShoeGeeks,Nike Vomero 18,"Sizing: TTS.

I think we all know Nike has mostly only been good with their race shoes the last few years. However, the Zoom Fly 6 being a banger has given me hope that things are turning around with their other offerings. I walked into my local store a couple days ago and was surprised to see they had these in stock about a week early. Trying them on, they really felt great so I was out $150(great job by Nike to lower the price from the 17).

Upper wise, these are very plush, and wider than usual for a typical Nike fit. I think it will be accommodating for more than the usual runners that pick Nike. It‚Äôs not the most breathable upper and could be quite hot in summer but that‚Äôs the tradeoff for all this padding.

Midsole is the star of the show. It‚Äôs 46mm of stack, and this feels like a max stack shoe for the first time. The Vomero 17 was a nice cruiser but feels almost minimalist compared to this. The midsole feels like it is about half ZoomX with a ReactX base for stability and durability. The ride is lovely, smooth, comfortable, and helps you to not notice the weight as much. There is a really nice rocker geometry up front that keeps it rolling along. Speaking of weight, it is competitive with the Glycerin Max and Bondi 9, both of which it is in a similar class to. These are cruisers, not meant for speed but comfort, and they deliver that in spades.

Outsole is very tacky, and actually has some nice flex grooves to give the midsole some flex despite such a high stack. I really think this is a great option for recovery days or long easy runs, especially undercutting Hoka by $20 on the Bondi 9 or Brooks by $50 on the Glycerin Max.

1ixqhc6,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Bondi 9 thoughts at 100km,"Hoka Bondi 9 thoughts at 100km

M 6ft2 85kg HM 1:27 Mar: 3:09 
Shoes in rotation, Adios Prob3, Hoka Cielo x1, Saucony speed 4, Hoka Mach 6, Puma Magmax 

As titled suggests just crossed over the 100km mark in the Bondi 9s. 
Reason I picked them up was I‚Äôve had a lot of success with the Mach 6 and Cielo so thought would give these a go as a easy day/recovery shoe with the potential for an ultra shoe (definitely won‚Äôt be this though). 

Mainly used for recovery runs which are around 10-12km at 5:45 (min per km) pace. 

Fit: went true to size with no issues. If anything would say they maybe ever so slightly short but wasn‚Äôt an issue so would stick to your normal Hoka size. Very comfortable upper and very plush. One thing to note is I have a slightly flatter foot and can feel a bit of pressure on the side of my arch when I run. Hasn‚Äôt cause any issues but just putting it out there. 

Ride and review: so the ride is actually quite a bit firmer than I expected. I saw somewhere that they using a similar midsole compound to the Mach 6 (unsure if that is accurate) but would say they very different feelings. Where the Mach is soft with a bouncy feeling and energy return I find the Bondi just a little flat and doesn‚Äôt give you a whole lot back. 
This lack of bounce with a firmer feeling just leaves me a little unsure of what Hoka is trying to do with the shoe. From what I am looking for it just feels to firm for recovery but just not enough push/energy return for anything else. 
It‚Äôs almost like Hoka have tried to go one of two ways, they tried to make a big bouncy shoe and which rivals the superblast (but they have this in their rotation anyway so doubt it was this) which I would say have missed the mark or they have focused specifically on a good walking shoe, which I think it could work well for. 

In summary it‚Äôs fine, I personally wouldn‚Äôt pick it again. Even just looking in Hoka‚Äôs line up I think the Clifton would be a better option, and believe is both lighter and cheaper. I just struggle to see how and where the shoe fits into the Hoka line up. 

A side note not related to the performance. I first started to see Hoka when they became the like ‚Äúfashion‚Äù running shoe. Specifically like bold, fun colours and really stood out. But recently it seems like they‚Äôve left their creativity at home. All the colours just look bland and boring. Im sure there a lot of people who think the opposite to me but would be nice to see Hoka return to that fun side of the brand. 

I‚Äôll continue to use them as a recovery shoe just to get some use out of them but won‚Äôt be used for much else. A pity as think it‚Äôs a miss from Hoka (for me personally). 
Happy to answer any questions.

it really bums me out because i was dealing with constant plantar fasciitis until i got these shoes and haven't experienced it since, they're great, but i do wonder if this is just the average lifespan of hokas? would a different version be better, or am i just an outlier? i need new shoes now but i'm not sure whether i should purchase hokas again or try another brand out.

1ixhn38,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Worth buying supershoes/expensive models with a yearly big discount?,"Hey guys,


About me: 5'9, 78kg, started running a year ago and run about 3 times a week. Mostly run for health and fun, no races planned but intend to do a half marathon In the next year maybe. My 5k PB is 26 mins and my easy pace is probably around 6:30 mins per km. Currently only have an Asics Cumulus 26 which I'm fine with but don't really love.  In terms of shoe rotation I'm looking for a shoe that would help with longer runs so something with a bit more cushion or something a bit more fun. 

Bit of an odd question but wanted to get your opinions on the best way to make use of a running shoe discount I get. As part of my workplace health insurance (UK) I get 50% off a pair of running shoes every plan year from a partner website. They don't stock every shoe and a lot of the nicer colourways and newer, popular models are missing (e.g. no Novablast/Superblasts, no Adios Pro 4). However, they do have a decent selection, including the following (discounted price in parentheses but basically 50% off)

- Adidas Prime X Strung 2 (¬£125)
- Adios Pro 3 (¬£110)
- Boston 12 (¬£70) 
- ASICS Nimbus 27 (¬£90)
- Puma models - Magmax, Deviate Nitro (don't remember exact price)
- Hoka Cielo X1 ~~(¬£110)~~ (¬£125)
- And a few more super shoes from Saucony, Mizuno etc. 

I've been considering the Adios Pro 3 as a daily trainer given the discount and it's only ¬£30-40 more than the other daily trainers like the Boston 12. I would never consider it as a daily trainer at full price but at this price it's definitely got me curious. Wondering what you guys would do in this situation - make the most of the discount and get the supertrainers or still go for the cheaper models and save some money? Not looking for shoe recommendations - mainly just wanted to see what others would do. Thanks for reading!

TLDR; if I have a 50% discount yearly is it worth buying Adios Pro 3/another supershoe as a daily trainer for a noob runner",2025-02-25 00:23:14+00:00,4,17

I have been doing some digging on previous posts on here relating to recommended shoes and it seems like there are a lot of opinions on where to look.

Effectively as I am still not a committed regular runner I don't want to fork out for the best shoes going but also don't want to waste on something cheap as the reason i want new shoes is my current basic nikes give me really sore feet post run.

As the ground begins to dry and harden over the spring/summer months and mud isn't a factor, will I need to get different shoes?   
  
With respect to terrain, I always try to avoid roads and stick to trails across the downs and through woods etc. I would like to drive up to Wales one morning and do Pen Y Fan, but that likely be as close to fell running as I want to get.

I‚Äôve been running in my HOKA challenger ATR 5‚Äôs as they‚Äôre my best option atm. (I‚Äôm aware these aren‚Äôt remotely barefoot or even BFF) 

I wear barefoot shoes for daily life and work, during the dry and less muddy days I typically run in vivobarefoot Primus trail. However, they are just not an option as I just look like Bambi on ice running along the coast paths. 

Does a barefoot shoe exist that can handle mud? Would it even be possible to add deep enough luggs onto a barefoot shoe? 

I may find a barefoot sub to share this to as well as I understand it may be a bit niche. Any shoe suggestions are always welcome, or any brands that have wider toe-box.

1iweb20,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Cielo X1 2.0 (20 miles including Half Marathon) First Thoughts,"Background: M30 150 lbs, HM 1:35
Daily Trainers: Hoka Mach 6, Hoka Mach X



What I‚Äôve done so far: 7 mile break-in run at 8:15 min/mile pace.  Half Marathon Race (PB).



Fit and Feel:  I‚Äôm wearing TTS and would say these are more spacious than typical super shoes.  The upper is very comfortable (material has a plastic-like texture).  The rocker is aggressive and foam has a fun bounce to it.  Forefoot platform is decent width, but heel is narrow and can be wobbly.  Stability feels fine while running for the most part.  I appreciated the heel collar being padded and structured rather than thin and wobbly like many other race day shoes.



Post-Race Thoughts: 

Positives: These are an absolute blast to run in.    They were very protective and I did not have any foot fatigue until the final two miles of the HM.  I cut 5 minutes off my PB so I am very pleased with their performance.  They kept me rolling along effortlessly.



Negatives: Disclaimer I do not strength train at all, they were beating up muscles that I would normally never feel during a run.  There was a little foot sliding going on, but after locking the laces down tighter it was resolved.  Running downhill felt uncontrollable.



I think the Cielo X1 2.0 is a super shoe for those prioritizing fun and comfort during races, rather than pure speed or stability.",2025-02-23 16:43:15+00:00,136,22
1iwbl15,Hoka,RIP My Brave Speedgoat 5s,"I bought new Hoka Speedgoat 5 shoes at the REI closeout sale last Summer (was a steal at $65 - wish I had bought 3 or 4 more at that price). I replaced the insoles with the Superfeet Green (I have a high arch) insoles. Wore them for a few days to break them in. Then I backpacked the 240 mile long, John Muir Trail in the Sierra Nevada range, California. 240 miles (the JMT is 211 miles from Whitney to Happy Isles in Yosemite, but I had to hike extra to get to Whitney) on a rocky mountain trail over 3 weeks. Not one single blister and no hot spots (I did wear toe socks) - one of the most comfortable shoes I've ever bought. I only had Merrills earlier, but their Moab 3 shoe quality is awful. I thus wanted to get a reliable pair for this trip. 

The shoes were really abused on a trail like this, and thus needed to be replaced once I finished my trip. But man, did they deliver. I was so happy with them that I bought 3 additional pairs of the Speedgoat 5 (I heard negative reviews about the 6), before they become unavailable, as they are discontinued - so I'm set for a couple of years. 

RIP my precious! You were loyal to the end.

1iwauti,hiking,Hiking Boot: Altra vs. Hoka?,"I‚Äôll soon be doing a four day hike through the Grand Canyon. I tried on an Altra Lone Peak 9 and a Hoka Kaha 3 GTX at REI.

The Hoka was extremely cushiony (which was great), but the sales person convinced me that it‚Äôs a terrible shoe and I ended up leaving with the Altra.

I understand that Altra is known for having a wide toe box, but also for forcing the user to rely on their lower body for cushioning.

I am not a super experienced hiker. I‚Äôm thinking that maybe it‚Äôs a good idea to go back to the Hoka but get a sizer bigger. The extra cushioning felt great.

I often experience discomfort (and sometimes even legit pain) on the lateral side of my feet with many running shoes, whether standing, walking or running. I believe this has to do with the way a lot of shoes are shaped with that inward curve on the lateral side and I am really struggling to find a shoe that fits me without having that issue. I‚Äôve also tried multiple widths and it seems like the toebox will get wider but the midfoot doesn‚Äôt seem to feel much better. For context, I‚Äôm normally a size 14 men‚Äôs, going up a size usually makes the toebox a bit too ‚Äúlong‚Äù for my liking.

1ivvnnr,Hoka,Last pair of Hokas,"I've been buying Hokas for myself and my spouse since 2020, and while I've noticed some quality downgrade over this period, the brand still seemed worthwhile to me. Well, lesson learned. 

I go through about 2 pairs a year (it's basically all I wear), so I like to sometimes buy an extra to have on-hand. I bought a new pair in January to store, and started using my ""stashed"" pair, bought 17 months earlier (which were a different color than my usual, so I didn't get to them as fast). They seemed a little weirdly tight, especially on the right side, but I figured it would be ok after a few wears. Well, a month later I had bursitis on my outer mid-right foot. I tried on my newest just-bought pair, and they didn't pinch in that spot at all. My partner tried them both and verified that the one shoe was defectively made. I figured this would be a quick fix from Hoka. But Hoka CS refused to help since the purchase date was over a year ago.

I understand if this were a preference issue, but for a defect?? Seems pretty ridiculous to punish a long-time customer who trusted in the brand enough to feel confident in buying and storing extra pairs. To make matters worse, when CS decided not to help, they additionally sent over a guide on stretching the shoe, which, as a disabled person with mobility issues (aka, why I need extra cushioned yet stable shoes in the first place), isn‚Äôt just absurd‚Äî it‚Äôs dangerous. Bursitis and the potential for skin infections is something I definitely can't mess around with. And Hoka didn't care that the defect caused me to have an injury-- they just recited the warranty and basically said too bad so sad.

So I‚Äôm done with the brand, and wanted to share this feedback with the community, as I will now be relying on similar feedback to try and find a more reputable and good quality brand.",2025-02-22 23:03:43+00:00,0,13

So, a few days ago, I went in to buy another pair of Hoka's and was persuaded by a more experienced salesperson to try on a size 11B (they never seem to have WIDE in size 10 or 11). Although I felt I was swimming in them, the salesperson explained why it was better to have even more room in the toe box than what I was experiencing with the size 10B. I'd thought I was sizing up with the 10B, but in reality, I actually needed the 11B.

1ivgd8d,AskRunningShoeGeeks,First Marathon Shoe for heavier runner on a budget.,"I'm planning to run my first Marathon in about 12 weeks time, 177cm@87kg.

My primary running shoe has been the Nike Pegasus for the past few years (usually I buy last years model at a discount), which I've seen isn't particularly popular on this sub, but works for me. 

I like the amount of cushioning and energy return it gives and have run anything from 5k to half-marathon, but I feel like I will need something that will spare my legs a bit more for a full marathon, which I'm planning to complete under 4 hours with a 3:45 stretch goal.

I'm not particularly keen to spend 200+ Euro on a super shoe, as I'm not sure yet if this marathon will be a one-time event or not and I see little use for them in my regular running, so I'm looking for something that I can also use outside of races.

I have seen the Asics Superblast 2 is generally the recommend shoe, but it's hard to find and also rather pricey.

Here are some shoes that I could get in my home country at a decent price (<120 Euro or less):
Asics GLIDERIDE MAX
Asics NOVABLAST 5
NIKE VOMERO 17
HOKA CARBON X 3

I'm leaning towards the NovaBlast at the moment.
I'm also thinking about picking up the Adizero SL2, just because it has a great price (~65 Euro), but feel like it might not have enough cushioning for the full marathon.

A podiatrist helped and prescribed me 3 weeks of meloxicam and made me an arch support pad from foam and bandages. He actually told me to stop PT and just do toe curls for 3 weeks. After three weeks I used the pad and pills as needed to calm inflammation from a bad day. 

I started ramping up activity by:
- being diligent about stretching the soleus and gastroc. I think a lot of people forget about the soleus
- Foam rolling the Achilles
- Holding a bear crawl position to stretch the foot
- Doing toe control exercises 
- Calf raises
- focused on correcting some tightness/weakness around my hips

1iv1lal,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Cielo X1 2.0 - First Run,"Hoka Cielo X1 2.0 - First Run

I'm not really a fan of first run reviews, but thought this might be helpful for people with upcoming races or who loved the first version of this shoe.

My first run consisted of a quick warmup straight into 9 miles at marathon effort. The Cielo X1 2.0 met my sky high expectations and I wanted to offer some early feedback compared to the first version.

I'll start off by saying the Cielo X1 is my favorite shoe of all time. I ran my marathon PR (2:49) and posted a review about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/comments/1c1pqwu/hoka_cielo_x1_marathon_review/). Suffice to say, I was really looking forward to this update and so far, it has not disappointed. As other early reviews have said, they really did fix the biggest issues with the first version.

* The weight: it's almost 1.5oz lighter than the first version in my size (men's 10.5US), coming in at 8.1oz/229g. For reference, it's now basically the same weight as the Alphafly 3 in my size.
* The upper/fit: The upper material the biggest reason for the decrease in weight and much more in line with other racing shoes. It's still one of the most supportive uppers in a race shoe out there, but it's much more race-like than the original version. The fit is much more snug than the first version and fit my medium-narrow width foot perfectly. The lockdown is also now one of the best out there (up there with Puma for me). I had no issues and didn't have to retie my shoes after my warmup to get a better lockdown, which I pretty commonly have to do with other race shoes.
* The laces: I know the fixed this on later colorways of the first version, but just wanted to point out that it's also fixed in the new version. The laces good, but not anything to write home about.

Some other differences from the first version, good and bad:

* The rocker is even more aggressive, especially the heel bevel. It actually feels like it has a zero or even negative drop upon step in. However, on the run it feels completely natural and perfect for mid to forefoot striking, especially at faster paces. My hot take is that this is the shoe that the Mizuno Wave Rebellion Pro is trying to be.
* The foam feels even bouncier.
* It's a little less stable. Others have already mentioned this or guessed based on the pictures, but they moved the midsole cutout to the medial side and also decreased the width in the heel and midfoot. It's a little noticeable at slower paces, but goes away at faster paces. I still wouldn't call it *unstable* and would consider it as the average high stacked racing shoe, it's just that the first version was more stable than average IMO.

Overall, my first impressions are fantastic. I'm currently training for a marathon and this is easily my top choice. This is finally a racing shoe where I don't question if there are better options out there. However, like others out there, I will miss the first version as the ultimate marathon training shoe, but my hunch (or hope) is that they move the Mach X or Skyward X more in that direction.",2025-02-21 21:01:24+00:00,163,50

1iv0010,bunions,Feeling extremely bummed about how much a bunion is affecting my hobbies and looking for advice,"Hi! I have a very very mild bunion on my right foot and a moderate bunion on my left foot. I'm not in in pain when I wear ""regular""  wide shoes (altras, barebarics, danskin, uggs, birks). While I miss cute shoes (heels, loafers, flats) for formal events, it's not a motivating factor for me to consider surgery.  

I am however starting to experience pain in hiking boots (hokas) and that's my favorite thing in the world. I also was once an avid runner and skier. Running causes intense pain and winter sports are out of the question. I'd love to be able to rock climb with my husband and friends but those shoes are a no go to. The one doc I went to see was not keen on surgery - just said I should give up things I love to avoid the pain esp since all those things are very skinny shoes + lots of toe pressure.  

Do I just keep trying new shoes in hopes I can keep my hobbies?  If you had bunion surgery for the ability to do high impact to toe region sports again, was it worth it and did it succeed?  Should I pursue another doctor? Do you have one within 1.5 hours of Pittsburgh PA that you love? ",2025-02-21 19:54:59+00:00,7,8

I had temporary pins in my big toes that were removed 8 days ago. Yesterday I wore my Hokas for the first time since before surgery (the shoes are very wide, 1/2 size bigger to accommodate swelling). I also wore compression socks for the first time, all day. I wasn't on my feet more yesterday for an extended period of time, just the same amount I've normally done for the last few weeks. My feet felt very good when I went to bed; in fact, I thought to myself that it was the most ""normal"" they've felt since pre-surgery. However, I woke up in the middle of the night with a lot of pain in the bunion area, mostly the right foot. It feels as if I've taken a few weeks back in my recovery process, and I'm very depressed about it.

1iug8iq,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Ways to prevent premature warping of the foam midsole in my running shoes?,"I have a long-running issue of all my shoes quickly becoming unusable due to uneven compression of the foam midsole. What happens is that in under 15 wears or so, the foam in one shoe always ends up ""packing down"" significantly on the medial side and losing all support. As an overpronator, this causes my foot to pronate even more than it does naturally, which exacerbates some of my issues higher up on the kinetic chain.

This happened with my pairs of Brooks Adrenaline, Hoka Arahi, as well as Nike and New Balance walking shoes. Are there any shoes out there with a more resilient foam? Would rigid stability insoles in neutral shoes prevent this type of warping from happening?

1iuf303,sesamoid,Shoes post surgery,"Hi!

I have several questions regarding surgery. I‚Äôve been dealing with sesamoiditis for two years now. However, I was misdiagnosed for a year, and after getting fed up, I decided to pay for an MRI myself. The results confirmed that it was indeed sesamoiditis.

After getting the diagnosis, I consulted three different podiatrists, a kinesiologist, a physiotherapist, and even an acupuncturist. In the end, I had custom orthotics made, which were quite expensive, and, following my podiatrist‚Äôs recommendation, I now wear Hoka shoes. Over the past year, I‚Äôve also had two cortisone injections, which provided relief for about a month each time, but the pain always comes back. I‚Äôm really at my limit and ready to go for surgery.

I have two questions:
	1.	Does anyone have a recommendation for a surgeon in Canada?
	2.	After surgery, will I be able to wear the shoes of my choice again, or will I be stuck wearing brands like Hoka and Altra forever?

I'm convinced something is off as my feet have been aching like they did before I wore Hokas, and the ones I was replacing actually feel better than the new ones.

1iu1a3u,PlantarFasciitis,Saw Podiatrist for the First Time!,"I've been following along in this subreddit for 6 months since my right heel pain has gotten worse. I wanted to share my experience with my podiatrist. Reading everyone's journeys has really helped me not feel hopeless or defeated, hoping I can provide the same for some people! (Even though of course we're all different)

Short background about my lifestyle/what I've tried. I'm somewhat active (less so since my foot pain). I work in an office part time and bartend part time. The pain definitely increases when working at the bar. I've been stretching and massaging my calf regularly which helps some. Orthotics from Amazon haven't worked much for me. I did buy Hokas Bondi 8 and Teva Hurricane XLT (women's) sandals, which feel great. Unfortunately I can't wear either of those to either jobs, so I don't get relief while on the clock. Orthotics were my hope since I can insert them in any shoe, but I didn't wanna keep throwing money at random ones without knowing for sure.

I got an x ray to confirm my PF, it showed two bone spurs. Which she explained doesn't necessarily cause the pain but is a very good indication of PF. The cause of the pain is the strain on that muscle of course. My first step was confirming the PF since I've been assuming this whole time. She basically said a lot of what I've read about in here. Stretching being a huge tool for treatment since this is likely a lifelong battle for me. However she recommended I focus heavy on my hamstrings and hips, since my calf mobility is great (because that's what I've been focusing on). She said those muscles don't get mentioned as often to stretch  and strengthen for PF and can really help with treatment.  Then recommended Power Step Pro Tech orthotics, she said these are sold specifically for Podiatrists and the Power Step Pinnacle orthotics (easily found on Amazon etc) aren't as sturdy. Which makes sense because I've tried the Pinnacles and didn't have much success. She mentioned the Pro Tech orthotics should work well for me with a neutral arch and she also highly recommends them for flat footed people. She recommended I go to the running shoe store and try on various shoes if I wanted more options, I'm happy with my Hokas and Tevas for now. She believes a strong orthotic is the key over just a good shoe. Also recommended OOFOS slides for house shoes. In addition to all of that she said she's not a huge fan of cortisone shots because they're just a band aid and don't last long, I am not a fan of putting a needle in my foot so that's fine for me. I am going on a big trip to Thailand in two weeks so she prescribe some NSAIDS to help with inflammation while I'm out there.

I'm going to start regularly stretching and strengthening with focus on hamstrings and hips, throw these Pro Techs in all my shoes, grab some OOFOS and hope I won't be hobbling everywhere anymore!! 

TLDR: got an xray, confirmed bone spurs, PF and neutral arch. Doctors recommended treatment is stretching focused on hamstrings and hips (not just calves) and Power Step Pro Tech (not Pinnacle) orthotics for my neutral arch. Said this will likely be lifelong battle. With addition to OOFOS slides at home and prescribed NSAIDS for out of country trip and inflammation in general. ",2025-02-20 15:36:31+00:00,1,6

My gait has changed because putting any pressure on my inner heel causes pain so as a result I've developed hip and lower back pain.

They never even sent the molds out once they saw insurance had covered it 100%. 


I've had my hokas for 10 months and they already have a hole in the heel on the same foot I have my PF on, so I submitted a warranty claim and they are making me send the shoes back to ""determine if the damage is eligible for a warranty claim"".

Are they still good? How's the cushioning? I don't want nor like midsoles that are too soft (like the Hoka Speedgoats) but I don't know how firm the midsole from the Peregrine is.

I am a light (68kg - 150lbs) runner, who runs short distances (up to 30km / 18 miles) and I compete for podiums in my regional races.

I have had several trail running shoes but I still haven't found ""the one"" yet.  
  
For example, I have the Asics Trabuco 10 wich are ok but the heel lock is weak and they're too heavy, especially when wet. The cushioning is ok but considering the weight, they're not ideal.

I have the Salomon Sense Ride 4 which fit my feet really well but the midsole is hard as a rock. They have, by far, the stiffest midsole of all of my running shoes, and I have more than 12 pais, considering the road ones. I also don't like their lacing system, it's not great.  
I do some road running with my trail shoes in the transition period from home to the mountain, or in races, and that is painful, especially in descents. The midsole is so stiff that it looks like they are counterfeit, but I know that they aren't.

I also own the Adidas Terrex Speed Flow which are great but I'd like to have a bit more cushioning and/or, at least, bigger lugs for muddy conditions. These have the lowest stack height of all of the shoes mentioned above but the cushioning is decent.

I also own a pair from Decathlon which aren't great at anything but they last forever (1100km and still going strong) and cost me 30‚Ç¨. They aren't bad at anything also, great for the price.  
I've owned other Decathlon trail running shoes (XT7 and Kiprun Race 4) and they were great for the price.

1itiybc,Hoka,Bondi 9 are a huge down grade from the Bondi 8‚Äôs,"Long time Bondi owner. Practically the only shoe I have bought for years at this point. I really was excited to get my Bondi 9‚Äôs but after seeing them and trying them on I am very disappointed.

There are several down grades. 

1) everything about the profile of the shoe is smaller, except for the height. 

   The previous generations of Bondi had an almost comically wide shoe base that made the shoe look like it came out of kingdom hearts. That wide base gave the shoe a lot of grounding support. Bondi‚Äôs already were a ‚Äútall shoe‚Äù so the extra width was nice. It kept me from rolling my ankles. 

All that is gone now. The shoe has an almost normal width to a running shoe except it looks like it‚Äôs on a platform with how much padding is on the base of the shoe. 

Inner sides of my feet hang over the side of the shoe base. This is not the move and my foot feels very likely to roll while walking or running in these shoes.

2) the amount of area you can lace up is less compared to the Bondi 8, and the laces and lace holes feel cheaper compared to my Bondi 8‚Äôs. They also can‚Äôt lace as high up as the 8‚Äôs.

3)They took away pretty much all ankle support by making the ankle walls and padding shorter. The ankle wall in sub ankle at this point. And all upper foot support is gone.


This is a trash product and it took away all the things that made the Bondis great. This is my 6th pair and I am probably not going to buy anything from hoka at this point. ",2025-02-19 22:42:51+00:00,17,26
1iteto7,trailrunning,Road runner to trail runner - first pair of trail shoes,"I‚Äôve been running consistently for a little over a year almost all on the road but I travel some for work to places with great trails, some technical with around 1k of vert. I would be primarily running 3-10 miles at a time and dedicating the shoes to trail use, not road to trail. 

Looking at the following:
Altra lone peak 
Hoka speedgoat
Brooks cascadia 

I currently run in Brooks glycerine, asics glideride max and new balance sc trainers. 

I have a wide midfoot and really like the feel of the lone peak but I am worried about the zero drop. Is trail running easier to ease into the zero drop shoes? The hoka seem like the go to but I haven‚Äôt got much experience with hoka, brooks are a safe bet for me on the road but need some direction on if they will work well for me on the trail.

I‚Äôm going on a 3-week hiking trip to Japan this August, where temperatures can reach around 30¬∞C (86¬∞F). We plan to walk around 20 km (~12 miles) a day, mostly on trails but occasionally tackling some mountains. So, a mix of trails and some rougher terrain.

I‚Äôm torn between two options:

Merrell Moab 3 GTX ‚Äì Seems durable and reliable, but I‚Äôm worried the GTX will be too warm in the humid Japanese summer.

Hoka Speedgoat 5/6 ‚Äì Super lightweight and comfortable, but I‚Äôm unsure if they‚Äôre sturdy enough for longer hikes with occasional mountain terrain.


What I‚Äôm looking for:

Comfort for long distances (20 km/day)

Good ventilation for hot weather

Reliable grip for trails and light mountain hikes

Blister prevention is super important

Bonus: If they look stylish enough for casual wear too

1it9dd9,sesamoid,"Stress fracture with lower-level, nagging pain","Back in September, after indoor soccer one night, I developed a huge bruise around the ball of my foot. The pain was intense, around a 6 or 7 out of 10. I stopped playing soccer and running, just walking on it, and over the next few weeks, it improved to about a 3. However, it plateaued and wouldn't get better despite resting.  
  
I even ran a half marathon three weeks after the initial pain, with pain around a 5 out of 10. After significant rest post-race and no improvement, I visited my orthopedist in November. An MRI showed a stress fracture in the sesamoid with no other damage. He put me in a boot and orthopedic shoe, but I didn't fully commit to them (plus occasionally going way too hard on things like the StairMaster, yeah I know I know).  
  
A month ago, I was told to fully commit to the boot. I wore it consistently even during workouts (that focused on core and upper body, obviously), though I did some rowing without the boot. Recently, when I remove the boot, the foot feels a bit better, but it's still painful when pressed in certain spots. Throughout this whole process, the pain has generally been in the 3 to 4 range out of 10, which makes it hard to use pain as a guide like my doctor suggests.  
  
I'm having a tough time navigating conflicting advice, both online and from my doctor. I just want to know if there's light at the end of the tunnel. Has anyone experienced similar constant, lower-level pain? My doctor recently gave me dancer's pads, which I'm trying out, but I'm still wearing the boot and am okay with continuing if needed.  
  
I'm also unsure about footwear. I've been using Saucony trail running shoes with a 4mm drop and limited cushioning. Should I change those to Hokas? Rocker or no rocker? I'm feeling lost and would appreciate any advice or experiences you can share. Thanks!",2025-02-19 16:19:51+00:00,1,14

Likely to have **loose rocks** on one section and **rocky/muddy** on another. UK weather so probably raining at the time!

I bought **Nike Ultrafly** thinking they'll be perfect due to zoom-x, plate and Vibram megagrip. Felt amazing underfoot on my first run, but I took them out for a long run yesterday and got blisters on the outside edge of my big toes, also between little toe and 4th toe, and also where the trail logo was creasing on the inside edge of the shoe (behind the big toe). I had to stop due to the pain. *This surprised me a lot as every review I read praised the forefoot/toebox width!* I think it's due to the Vaporweave material not stretching?

**Novablast 5** fit me well (maybe a tad long), but think the grip won't be good enough for the off-road sections. Also have the **Nike Pegasus Trail 5** which are good for me for daily training, but don't know if they're suitable for marathon distance?

I usually use size US 12.5 in Hoka. Unfortunately, Hoka does not produce this size for racing shoes and they jump from size US 12 to size US 13. 


I have a narrow foot, I like a tight fit but with room for the toes. I will use the shoe for half marathons and marathons.

This version of Cielo is narrower than the previous one (Cielo X1) and I think it will be better for me than its predecessor because the upper and fit have been significantly improved. 

If you have any questions I can compare them to other Hoka models

""Prolotherapy is a treatment option for plantar fasciitis that involves injecting a solution, typically a concentrated sugar (dextrose) solution, into the affected area of the plantar fascia, which triggers the body's natural healing process to promote tissue regeneration and reduce pain by stimulating collagen production and strengthening the weakened fascia; essentially, it aims to repair the injured tissue by causing a controlled inflammatory response that leads to new tissue growth.

What shoe would you advise for me? I have been alternating between Altra Escalante 4 and Asics Novablast 4 (bad idea, I know!), but going to drop the Novablasts from my rotation for now for a few reasons, but mainly they're too narrow and I¬†*think*¬†my form slips while running in them (working on weight training to help so maybe this won't be an issue in the future). Though, I cannot deny I run faster in them and they're... fun? I love my Altra Escalantes ‚Äì I began running with high cushion shoes like the Invincibles and on a whim bought the Escalantes after trying them on in store. TBH, they made me fall in love with running. I love the ""ground feel"" ‚Äì it's a completely different sensory experience. With that said, I'd like to add 1-2 shoes into my rotation for variety.

Most recently, I've tried on in store:

\- Topo Phantom 3 ‚Äì so far my #1 from what I've tried on. They feel a bit slimmer in the toe box than my Altras, so it's possible I may need to get a wide size.

\- Altra FWD Via, Altra Flow Experience, Altra Torin 8 ‚Äì all felt a little too mushy? I think FWD was my favorite in terms of fit with the Torin 8 close behind, but the Torin felt a little too soft? The heal tab on all three, dear god ‚Äì why. They weren't comfortable in store, can't imagine they'll be comfortable in a run, but I guess they work for folks.

\- Hoka Clifton 9 ‚Äì too narrow, they didn't have wide in store so maybe I'll order online to try them out, but I also kind of hate logo design on the shoe.

Looking at the Wiki of r/RunningShoeGeeks , I've narrowed it down to the following shoes that are avail in wide and have <=6mm heal drop:

\- Asics Evoride Speed 2

\- NB FuelCell Rebel v4

\- Fresh Foam X More v5 (could possibly be too cushiony?)

\- Fresh Foam X 1080v14

Any thoughts on the above or additional recommendations for a companion daily trainer and/or a shoe for speed work? I'd prefer a lower stack, mostly aesthetics, but not a hard requirement. I'm okay with the Escalantes being my go-to shoe for that.

The other thing is they like they propel me forward well, I assume this is to do with the drop but it also almost feels like the shape of the sole matches my running gait.

Is anyone able to give more clear explanation of what it is that‚Äôs working well for me or able to suggest other shoes that are similar/even better based on the above?

1irq3ht,AskRunningShoeGeeks,DN3 / VN3 / SB2 / NB5,"Good evening,

can you please advise on new running shoes?

My details:
39 y/o male
90kg; 179cm
PR: 5km: 25:31; 10km: 53:07; HM: 1:58; Marathon: 5:00 (did not train properly and basically jogged alongside my brother while having a good conversation. Target was to finish)

My previous shoes:
Asics Nimbus (plush, slow, heel counter destroyed pretty soon)
HOKA Clifton (boring... but great drop of 5mm)
Asics Noosa Tri (great drop, very light, breathable, fast, lacks suspension, lacks grip)
PUMA Deviate Nitro 2 (fell in love with this shoe: great breathability, fast and responsive, yet comfortable for slow paces, ..).

My Deviates have 400km already and I will be running a Marathon in October so considering new shoes to rotation. So far (based on kofuzi's reviews and runrepeat reviews) I have selected the following as a potential next step:

Novablast 5 / Superblast 2 (from what I have read, the NB5 may be more approproate? Or is it just the matter of cost?)
PUMA Velocity Nitro 3 (looks like Deviate without the plate)
PUMA Deviate Nitro 3 (or possibly wait for version 4).

My aim is to run often for 5km / 10km and start serious training in few weeks (based on the weather).

I am, by no means, a fast runner and aim for consistency, comfort and safety but not a plush heavy shoe (Bondi, Nimbus...). 

Thank you",2025-02-17 17:59:04+00:00,2,4

I‚Äôm looking for a single pair of Hokas that can do it all:

* Small sprints and jumps (I do circuit-training style workouts)
* Some wrestling drills (so I need decent lateral support)
* Long hours of walking at my job (I work in a hospital, so I‚Äôm on my feet for 8‚Äì10 hours a day)

I‚Äôve checked out several Hoka models (Bondi, Clifton, Kawana, Tivra, etc.) but I‚Äôm a bit overwhelmed. I need solid cushioning for long shifts, but also decent stability and responsiveness for explosive exercises and sprints.

From what I‚Äôve read, the Kawana seems like a good all-rounder, but I‚Äôm still unsure. The Bondi SR looks perfect for work (lots of cushioning and slip-resistance), but I‚Äôm worried it might be too bulky for quick moves.

Has anyone here tried multiple Hoka models for different types of training? Any feedback or recommendations would be super helpful. Thanks in advance!",2025-02-16 16:15:53+00:00,0,6
1iquupv,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Unplated Speedwork / Threshold Trainer: Adidas or Hoka?,"I am looking to get into a more mixed training regimen, mostly for fun, but also to improve times across the board. As there are so many shows out now that I'm wanting to run in, I'm also looking to diversify my used cases, whereas I currently have my easy plodder and my daily do it-all (plus race day shoes I have only taken for one run to try out). 
  
I'm looking to add a dedicated shoe to the mix (see bottom for rotation and considerations) for Speedwork, intervals,  hill sprints, etc. and worth noting that I plan for all of these efforts to be on road, not track. I prefer that this shoe not have a plate.  I'll also plan to use the same shoe for warmup and cool down so I don't have to bring a second pair with me.    

For context:    
+M35    
+6' (182.6cm); 160lbs (73kg)    
+Currently ~20mpw (~35km) road running, getting back into it after tendonitis.      &Want to be back at ~30-40mpw (~50-65km)     
+Mid foot striker    
+High insteps can make fits finicky for me     
+PRs - 5k: 19:35 | HM: 1:37:40 | FM: 3:33:46

Shoes I'm considering:    

**Adidas Adios 9 / Boston 12 / Evo SL:**  
  I'm really not sure which makes the most sense for me of these three. I can come up with an argument for every one of them to fit better than the others. In general, I'd expect a lot of these efforts to be in the ~10k range with warmup and cooldown included, so I'm thinking the Adios. But lower volume shoes can cause my feet problems.      

**Hoka Cielo Road:**     I don't see much about these at all comparing with more recent releases. I absolutely love the look of them. I figure they're most comparable to the Adios? Would their PEBA be dated at this point compared to the LS in the Adidas? I ran my FM and training regimen in Mach 5s and was very happy. Mach 6 did not work for my foot shape.       

How the current rotation looks:    
+**Brooks Ghost Max** (almost 300 miles on them) - recovery/easy until they're done. Already feeling pretty flat and the midsole has gotten pretty firm feeling.

+**Craft Pacer** (new) - recovery/easy run. Found it for $80 and took a chance. Jogging around the house, they feel plush and fun, and could probably add some pace to be a versatile option.     

+**New Balance Rebel v4** (just over 300 miles on 2nd pair) - my current Swiss army knife, and favorite shoe I've worn. Would keep using for daily activities + long runs. Originally planned to replace with Evo SL to try something new. May still do that along with a speed-focused shoe.    

+**Craft CTM Ultra 3** (new) - not really sure what to use this shoe for. Found it for $60 and it sounds like the shape may work for my foot, so figured I'd give it a shot. It hasn't arrived yet. Maybe long runs with some pace? And anything going light off-road.     

+**NB SC Elite v3** (5 miles) - racing      

Thanks for any insight.

La sportiva bushido (500+ mi): great shoe but not enough of a rocker and limited cushion for longer days. 

Salomon ultra glide (350 mi): great shoe but limited durability of midsole and not stable enough on varied terrain.

Hoka speedgoat 5: loved this shoe but can only seem to get 300 mi out of the midsole before I notice significant decline (still brought 5 pairs of these to 300+)

Hoka Mafate speed 4 (320+165mi): loved this shoe but a set or two of the  eyelits are not reinforced and will eventually rip, and the toebox is too narrow for me and gives blisters on the outside of my big toes. 

Saucony peregrin 3 (150 mi): like this shoe but long days or steep ascents are too much and the heel counter gives blisters (disclaimer: I have bony heels). I wear this for shorter runs with some tech but not much steep uphill. 

Saucony xodus 1 (250 mi): like this shoe but doesn‚Äôt perform well on technical terrain in terms of stability and outsole-lugs sheered off on first technical downhill. I wear this for non technical trails.

Altra lone peak 7 (300+ idk): like this shoe but just for non technical trails, Toe box is too wide to get a full lockdown. I use this shoe for hikes and walks on non technical terrain and it is the shoe i wear more than any other bc it is my daily shoe at work, where i am on my feet a few hours every day.
 
Nnormal tormir 2 (200 mi): like this shoe but the lockdown doesn‚Äôt prevent my toes from cramming into the front of the toebox on steep descents. I wear this for technical trails without steep descents. 

Hoka tecton x2 (12 mi): I have only worn this shoe twice for shorter (6 mi) runs, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to have the level of midsole comfort/cushion that would get me past 20 miles. I wear this for workout/faster runs on trails.

Hoka tecton x3: bought these for a race because of the upgrades to the midsole and then got injured and couldn‚Äôt do the race. Feel amazing on my feet and am excited to try these out when I have an opportunity. 

My trail shoe rotation is almost complete. But I am still searching for the unicorn: a trail shoe that has a grippy and durable outsole, a lockdown that is a good for technical trails and steep descents, and a midsole that is sufficiently stable, cushioned, and resilient. I like the outsole of the tormir, the midsole feel and durability of the tormir and xodus. And I like the lockdown of the bushido and speedgoat. If only the tormirs had a better lockdown‚Ä¶if only the speedgoat midsole didn‚Äôt degrade at 300 miles. Should I try the Nnormal Kjerag? Is there a frankenshoe out there for me? Redditors what say you

TLDR: is there such a thing as a trail shoe that has a durable and grippy outsole, durable,stable, and cushioned midsole, and a lockdown for technical trails and steep descents?

1ioikt1,AskRunningShoeGeeks,"""Graduating"" from Hoka Bondi 8","Hi all

I've been scouring this sub and the standard RSG sub, all of the content has been super helpful. I thought I'd hop on here to ask a specific question, however. 

Back in '23 I had a nasty hamstring injury which, during rehab, also triggered calf tendinitis. I worked very hard and through gym, physio and correct shoes, I managed to sort it out and get back to running - successfully completing a half marathon in May last year. This was all achieved through the very supportive Hoka Bondi 8s.

My rehab has continued super well and my muscles feel better than ever, however I don't want to abandon the safety of a super cushioned shoe. I would, however, like a slight change of pace to something a bit wider that may offer a bit more speed, if anything. 

I've been looking at:
- Mizuno Wave Sky 8
- Puma Magmax nitro 
- Brooks Glycerin Max 
- Hoka Bondi 9

At the moment, the Pumas and the Mizunos are top of my list. 

In short, and given the post-injury context and success with the Bondi 8s, does anyone have any specific thoughts on the options above / want to suggest a shoe I've missed? 

Disclaimer: I fell out with Asics years ago (shoes fell apart almost immediately, customer service was shocking) and stubbornly haven't bothered going back üòÇ",2025-02-13 13:03:43+00:00,1,1

1io443c,RunningShoeGeeks,Bondi 9 - First Impressions from a heavier runner (114 kg / 250 lbs) and comparison to Bondi 8,"I tested the new Bondi 9 on a 12km (7.5 mile) run with pace 6:00 min/km or 9:40 min/mile. From my perspective as a heavier tall runner (114 kg/250 lbs and 194 cm 6'4"") the shoe is great daily trainer. I wouldn't take them for a speed session and would rather use my Skyward X for a long and recovery runs.
Compared to the Bondi 8 they are much softer and springier, but they don't have half the energy return of the Skyward X. The Bondi 8 feels like a walking shoe compared to the Bondi 9. The Bondi 9 is also much softer than the Skyflow, which I was considering as an alternative. The foot roll is similar to the Skyward X but without the bounce. The upper is more roomy than the Bondi 8, I have a narrow foot and have to tie the laces tighter than the Bondi 8. The foam in the Bondi 9 midsole is stiff enough for my 1-1.5 hour runs between speed sessions and long runs and makes up for it with springiness and softness that Bondi 8 lacked. 
I am happy with the purchase and can finally consider my rotation complete, for which I thank everyone who helped me with advice here!

Hoka Bondi 9 - easy daily
Hoka Skyward X - long runs / recovery

My Hoka Clifton 9 are about to give their last strides so I am looking for their successor.

I used them for my easy and long runs, while I am using the Hoka Mach 5 & 6 for my speed runs. I have to say that I have not really been happy with the Clifton 9 so far.

Currently I owe a Nike Free rn 5.0 and a Vans Ultrarange, and they work fine, my heel pain is there still, but lower. Saturday I bought a On Cloudrunner 2, they were very comfy, but when I stood with them in work, my heels were killing me. I exchanged them for the Nike Invincible Run 3, that has massive cushin, but still hurt like hell. I want to trade them but not sure of which to get. 

I tried the 1080v14, but they are too bulky, same as the Kayano 31. Do you guys have any suggestions? I'm in Brazil so brands like Hoka and Brooks aren't widely available.

1imcfe9,Hoka,Hoka Bondi 8 Blisters after first use?,"Hello!  

I received a pair of Bondi 8's in a size 10D (my normal size) as a gift for the holidays.  I've never worn Bondi's before, but have a few other styles of Hokas that I really enjoy.  

The weather was finally nice enough to go for a longer walk (7 miles) - and they felt nice to start, but by the end of it there was the start of blisters on the [inner side heel](https://i.imgur.com/bTC2NeX.png) of each foot.  Basically if you draw a line where the top of the insole sits at the side of your heel.

Is this a ""common"" thing with Bondi's?  Would a wide (I don't normally wear wide) suit me better?  

I tried giving Hoka a call, but they said they might just need to be broken in, I could see a podiatrist, and they are out of the ""return/exchange"" window.  Not terribly helpful to say the least.",2025-02-10 18:00:28+00:00,2,9

1im5wyo,PlantarFasciitis,Check Your Shoes!,"In May 2024, I started dealing with major foot pain that eventually lead to tendonitis and plantar fasciitis. At some point, I ramped down roller skating from 3x a week to 1x a week to virtually zero due to the excruciating pain in my feet and calves. The pain was unbearable and left me crying and caused difficulty walking.

Fast forward to Thanksgiving, I could barely walk on my right foot without screaming out in pain. I finally mustered up the courage to go to the podiatrist to figure out what was going on. He put me in a soft cast, gave me a boot to wear at night, and specialized house shoes. This treatment improved my pain, but I still dealt with some aches, pins and needles feeling, and the ""tearing"" sensation at the arch of my foot. (I have very high arches, btw)

My podiatrist told me to invest in some better sneakers, specifically New Balance,  Asics or Hokas. I opted for the New Balances. I bought two pairs yesterday and wore one pair all day on Super Bowl Sunday. The pain is now gone. 

My shoe size is a women's 9 but depending on the shoe, I can go a half size smaller, fitting into a women's 8.5. Looking back, I believe my roller skates and some of my sneakers were too tight, adding extra pressure on my feet and causing the discomfort. My New Balances are a size 9 and that gives my toes more than enough room to move around and ""breathe"" without feeling constricted. 

I will continue to wear my boot at night. And I'm planning to give my sneakers a full week to see if this is truly a solution but I at least wanted to share my experience. It is like night and day with the pain. I plan to return to skating (in better fitting skates, of course) in the Spring.

I know my experience may not for everyone, but checking my shoe size was the best treatment for me in the long run. ",2025-02-10 13:19:53+00:00,17,18

I am due to my run first marathon this May 2025, and am currently training for it. I have been running for 1 year and 3 months so far, and have a few 5K and 10K races under my belt and one half marathon.

I have done ALL these in my Hoka Clifton 9s. They were comfortable, but I think that's literally their only benefit (for me). I don't think they actually did much else, so I would love some recs. 
I'd be okay to keep my cliftons for east runs/recovery runs, but for long (somewhat speedy) runs and for interval/threshold runs, I would love some recs. I really need to build a proper rotation. 

I'm 5'2, 120 pounds, female. I forefoot strike for the most part, but I don't think particularly means I should steer clear of shoes with a high drop.

I've been looking at, for threshold:
- Saucony Endorphin Speed 4 

For long runs where the shoes feel like they gobble up the KMs:
- Novablast 4
-Superblast 2 
- Gel Nimbus 26

2 weeks ago, I had a terrible flare up on my right foot. I could not walk, I was in crutches.. this is because I overworked myself one day.

So Ive been to the dr, had an ultrasound and there's a plan in place. I haven't had new shoes in 18 months so I would like to buy new ones and also some shoes to wear in the house (I wear socks or barefoot at home which isn't good).

I went to a foot store and they tested my walk and said my arch is extremely high. My instep is also very high.

Can anyone recommend some shoes? The lady at the shop was saying HOKA but I am worried to spend so much money and it isn't the right shoe? How do I know if it is the right shoe? Im looking for sneakers and also something like slippers to wear at home.

I know my shoes won't fix my plantar fasciitis but the right shoe can make a big difference in my mobility.

1ikza2u,PlantarFasciitis,Just had plantar fascia release surgery,"My PF pain journey started when I stepped on a tiny pea rock, barefoot, with my heel‚Ä¶with all my weight on it. Right in the fucking middle!! Never saw it coming and I saw stars. Hit the ground writhing in pain for a few minutes before attempting to ‚Äúwalk it off‚Äù, which might have worked at the moment but that pain remained for week. I dealt with it as best I could, and eventually it became manageable but I was always in pain by EOD. I‚Äôm a photographer, and I spend lots of time on my feet, and on my ass at the computer. So on my work days I‚Äôd come home banged up‚Ä¶but it‚Äôs followed by some rest days. This has been my life for the last 2 years, and it kinda sucked. I don‚Äôt like doctors. I hate injections. Don‚Äôt get me started on blood pressure medication. However, this pain was so constant and ever present that the thought of feeling exactly the same in 10 years and being just as limited (and older) made me do it. 

For more than 2 years I‚Äôve tried it all except the shockwave and prp because of the cost, insurance, etc‚Ä¶ so I did the cortisone injections 3x, like 20 sessions of PT, insoles, Hoka shoes, stretching constantly and I was still in pain and not really improving so my doc suggested the fascia release surgery. 

So, here I am. 4 days out from having had the surgery, which took place at a surgical center w/ mild anesthesia, but either way I never felt a thing. Out cold. Last thing I remember was a cute young face saying night night, here‚Äôs your ‚Äútequila‚Äù, and I woke up in the same bed 45 min later with my foot bandaged up. In less than an hour I was in a wheelchair and hopping myself into the passenger seat. I was told the basics of leg injuries: Protect, Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation. PRICE. Done that like a good Boy Scout and today I managed to get a regular shoe on. The rigid shoe/boot I was given is really annoying. My Hoka Bondi provides enough support and doesn‚Äôt flex. Either way I‚Äôm not putting weight on the heel so I‚Äôm walking funny, but I can move around my house and get shit done with the kids. Hard pass on the trip to the mall, but at least I can move at home and then I rest again as soon as it feels weird. 

Today I blew leaves off my front yard in tennis shoes. I hobbled around but got it done. Didn‚Äôt feel any weird tugs or pinches, just general soreness when on my feet. I have to fly for work in 2 weeks and need to kick ass so we‚Äôll just have to deal with it and move on.  PT and stretching should begin when I get the sutures out in 9 days. Surgeon saw my foot 2 days post-op and said it looked great. Fingers crossed üí™üèΩ

Update 12 days after surgery: I have been consistently feeling less pain and have been progressively better day over day. The usual problems after a day on my feet or going to pee at 3am, but every time is better. I get my stitches taken out tomorrow. Fingers crossed it all goes well. This coming week I have to fly, shooting all weekend then flying back Monday. I‚Äôm still taking Tylenol and some days with high activity the Ibuprofen 800. I‚Äôm still not at the point where it hurts less than it used to, but I can see that I‚Äôm almost there. I‚Äôve changed the bandages on the wounds myself 2 times now and have had an opportunity to see that the procedure was endoscopic. There‚Äôs an incision on each side of the heel. One is 3-4 stitches, barely an inch, and the other 5-6, maybe 1-1/4‚Äù. They look like they‚Äôre healing up well, particularly the small one. Curiously, my foot is not black and blue‚Ä¶not even underneath between the incisions. Maybe a little discoloration but not that typical hemorage look you get with some surgeries. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a glutton for punishment and was always moving. Wiggle your big toe. Wiggle your big toe! üòÜüòÜüòÜ Regardless, it still feels like I‚Äôm stepping on a finger when I walk. Wearing Hoka‚Äôs I can sustain a gait for a minute or two where my wife can‚Äôt spot me limping. Eventually I get your monkey brain takes over and revert back to it, because it hurts. It‚Äôs still swollen inside from end to end so that‚Äôs kind of par for the course, but also getting better every day. This is part of the reason I‚Äôm still taking the IBU, for inflammation. Particularly on the days that I‚Äôve been more active and iced less. Overall I‚Äôm happy with the progress so far. I‚Äôm in Miami and my doctor was Dr. Fuentes at OrthoMiami. Very happy with him, the staff, on-site PT and radiology. ",2025-02-08 22:17:30+00:00,43,33

I'm looking for a new pair of trail running shoes and could use some advice. I run a lot in hilly areas, so durability and good grip are my top priorities.

Previously, I used the La Sportiva Bushido 1 and 2, each lasting me over 1000km, so I‚Äôve been spoiled in terms of durability. My friends recommended the Hoka Speedgoat 5, which felt more comfortable but slower on downhills. However, after just 450km, they broke where the sole connects to the upper‚Äîprobably due to aggressive downhill running.

Now, I need to decide on my next pair. I'm considering:

* Hoka Speedgoat 6
* La Sportiva Bushido 3
* La Sportiva Akasha 2
* Hoka Mafate Speed 4
* Saucony Peregrine 15
* Brooks Catamount 3

I typically run up to 40km per week, never more than 25km in a single run. My training includes a mix of grass, flat terrain, and technical rocky trails, and I also race on steep, rocky courses.

I'm currently trying to run more with a potential goal of doing a HM or FM in 2026.

I ordered some ES4s, 1080v14s and Mach 6s but have returned all three as they either felt too tight or just nowhere near as good as the NB5s.

I want to get some more asics, especially considering they give a 90 day trial period in the UK. Hoka give 30 days and Brooks give 90 days too. I am not aware of any other brands that provide a trial period in the UK.

I'm specifically looking at getting some SB2 at some point. I may consider trying the MS4s too, especially given the trial period. Any other suggestions (asics or otherwise, given the ES4s and Mach 6s were too narrow and I love the NB5s)?

Fore context:

I had 2 easy runs on a treadmill with the same speed (7km/h) and time (45 min). For the first easy run, I used the Clifton 9 and my zone 2 was 60% of the run and 40% zone 3. So it felt like a tempo run even if I was running with my easy pace of 8:00-8:30. 

As for my second run the next day, I used my old ultraboost 19 and my zone 2 was 85% of the run and 15% zone 3. The run felt like a true easy run as compared to when I used the hokas even if I used the same speed and time on the same treadmill.

I was going to replace them with the velocity nitro 3's but tired some on yesterday and they felt completely dead on the forefoot but when I walked the heel felt as it should being somewhat soft. Being a forefoot striker and have had quite a few issues with stress reactions I have leant more towards more cushioned shoes just to protect my legs a bit more so will probably give them a miss sadly.

I'm not really too sure what else to go for since I've not been recommended anything else by friends. I'm tempted by the triumph 22 but have heard they're not as good as the previous models. Since I already have a pair of the nova 5's don't really want another yet and will be getting another pair of the more v5 when they run out. 

Slight side note, does anyone know if there will be a nova 5 trail version because most of my runs are in a park but the run itself is 50/50 trail and pavement so don't like using designated trail shoes. ",2025-02-07 20:22:35+00:00,1,9

1ik2773,RunningShoeGeeks,Brooks Hyperion Elite 4 PB,"So, I think we all know that Brooks hasn't really had a competitive race day option as they haven't used Peba...until now. I'm a running shoe junkie and when I saw that they were re-doing the Hyperion Elites with Peba, I was very curious to feel Brooks' interpretation of the foam. I did not come away disappointed!

Sizing: TTS.

Let's start with the upper...this is one of the best racing uppers out there. Incredibly breathable (you can feel the wind through the upper!), yet light and supportive. Highly comfortable as well. The sawtooth laces that Brooks uses should really be standard on any super shoe. Love them on the Alphafly/Vaporfly and love them here. There is a bit of a heel collar that is just enough to keep your Achilles from getting rubbed.

As far as the midsole and ride, this is fantastic. It is a little more gentle of a rocker than other super shoes I have recently tried (Adios Pro 4 is an aggressive one), but when you give this foam effort it MOVES. My workout was 6 miles with 4 at threshold and I had to hold myself in check to avoid encroaching on 5k paces. Snappy, propulsive, slightly denser than ZoomX but really feels good and quite stable for a super shoe. I'd compare this DNA Gold Peba similarly with Hoka's Peba in the Rocket X2/Cielo X1. 

This is a simple, no frills super shoe that in a way is refreshing as so many shoes have gotten crazy complex. I got vibes of the Vaporfly Next %2's in a great way, with a slightly more accommodating fit. A+ stuff, Brooks. Excited to see how they use this foam in other implementations in the Hyperion Max 3 and Elite 5. This shoe is also extremely light, I did not weigh it but it feels on par with the Vaporfly and Adios Pro 4 and maybe only a few grams heavier than the Metaspeed Edge Paris. Lighter than the Endorphin Pro 4 by a good bit and that is not a heavy shoe either.

Finally, the outsole...no qualms. I would highly recommend this for anyone looking for a super shoe with no fuss, that is accommodating for a variety of paces and footstrikes. You don't have to change your form or really adapt to a crazy rocker here, and in a way my feet are a lot happier with the slightly more natural feel here. Happy to answer questions.

Looking at shoe reviews can get a bit tough since some of the top race day shoes are truly meant for the fast front of the pack runners that will get absolutely everything out of the shoe as it was designed. Having said that, I'm looking for a race day shoe (my current is the NB RC Elite V2) and I've narrowed it down to these 3 that may be slightly more forgiving for someone who is in the 3:30+ range for a full marathon. My main use for these would be half marathon and full marathon.

Any thoughts on the Puma Deviate Nitro Elite 3, New Balance SC Elite V4, or Hoka Cielo X1?

I have very low arches, and can feel my feet collapsing in a bit, which leads to some inner ankle tenderness the next day.

I've seen a PT and am working on strengthening, but he also advised a mild stability shoe for the long runs while I'm working on strength.

I'm not super fast. Easy pace is about 10 min/mi, and I'm targeting a 4 hour marathon, so comfort is key - don't need anything speedy.

I like the Triumph 20/21 for the high, but not maximal, stack height for protection, while also having a somewhat firm and responsive feel, as opposed to the squish feeling a lot of high/max stack dailies have.

HOWEVER, this has contributed (potentially?) to my second toenails constantly getting bashed and turning black and falling off. I know this isn‚Äôt because the shoe is too small, but not I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs due to them moving around too much in the shoe. 

Has anyone had experience with this or have any advice? üôèüèª ",2025-02-05 16:27:20+00:00,2,6
1ii9o2i,PlantarFasciitis,Best shoes & tips?,"Hey everyone, I just went to the podiatrist yesterday after having terrible pain in my right foot for about 3 weeks. The Dr said it was plantar fasciitis but not the normal way it presents as it‚Äôs in my heel but also the entire side of my foot and doesn‚Äôt typically hurt in the morning- gets worse as the day goes on. I got the insoles she recommended by PowerStep, she also recommended wearing a boot for a few days which I‚Äôm waiting to come. She said Hoka‚Äôs are the best type of shoe for this condition but there are so many different options. I ended up buying Arahi 7s as they don‚Äôt look as high as the Bondi‚Äôs which is good for work. Has this shoe helped anyone? Any other recommendations? 
My child has surgery coming up next Tuesday at Children‚Äôs so I know I‚Äôll be doing a ton of walking and don‚Äôt want to be in a ton of pain the whole time.

1ii5fau,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Cielo X1 2.0 First Run,"About me:
Male - 5'11 - 81kg - 100km per week
5km: 19:59
10km: 42:30
HM: 1:35
Max HR: 196
Training for first marathon. 
Heel/mid-foot striker - cadence runner ~160spm @easy and ~180spm @HM pace

Preamble: This was my most anticipated shoe release of the year. The Cielo X1 is my favourite shoe ever. It's a brilliant stable trainer, but it is too heavy for raceday imo. A local sports store had the 2.0 in early and I had to pull the trigger. I'd watched Mike from The Run Testers' first run review, which made me temper my expectations. 

Fit: I sized up a half. Normally I wear 9, but for both the Cielo X1 and 2.0, I wear a 9.5. that's the size I use for my race shoes (AF3, AP3, SC Elite V3). The toe box is wide enough, but a bit shallower than the X1. 

Upper: Completely redesigned. It's a very thin, transparent plasticy material with some fabric. Really breathable and I had absolutely no issues getting a good lockdown, and experienced no discomfort from the upper. I never had any issues.with the original upper or laces either. 

Outsole: Reduction in rubber coverage in the mid-foot, leaving exposed foam. Noticeably reduced and narrowed heel bevel. This shoe is not heel striker friendly like the first. The forefoot is basically unchanged. It's quite thick rubber where it is placed and the traction was perfect, except on the wet cobbles, where I spun my wheels. I've not found that many shoes that do slick cobbles well though. The cutout has changed side, and I hate it. The first caused no issues and felt really stable. The cutout moving to the inside of the foot makes the shoe really unstable. There is significant inward collapse due to the position of that cutout. The little knob of foam that is left there is like a loose tooth. It freely wiggles when pinched.

Midsole: This foam is really soft. It's less dense than the original with noticable squish. You still have that really crazy pogo feeling right in the middle region, but it does press into the arch of my foot significantly. If you have flat feet, I can see this being a big issue. I have very high arches, luckily, so it wasn't a problem. The rocker is aggressive. Almost unnatural in the way it goes from pogo stick midfoot to toe off. It feels very awkward to walk in. 

The ride: So I had a 30km long run today with some pace variations. I did 6km WU in the Superblast 2 and a 4km Cool down in them. The remaining 20km, I wore the 2.0. I started the 2.0 with 6km @4:50/km. And I didn't love it. It felt wobbly and I was really having to work to hit that pace. The X1 felt effortless to cruise in here. Following the 6km @4:50, I had 5km steady @5:15. The shoe felt fine floating here, but I always felt like I was running on a bouncy handball because it literally feels like a handball is directly under your arch, and the rest of the shoe is just balancing on that (think circus elephant balancing on ball). After the 5km steady, I had 6km @4:30/km. The shoe felt better here. That aggressive geometry really kept my feet rolling through nicely. At times I did notice my pace slackening though, so I obviously wasn't locking it in as easily as it felt. But my max HR is 196, and I never went above 176 in this run, so the shoe was clearly quite efficient. Because of the rain, my feet were wet and they slipped on the insoles of these shoes excessively. Despite a good lock down, my toes did blister up, I suspect because I was sliding into the front of the shoe so often. The shoes are also the loudest, squeakiest shoe I've ever worn. They are LOUD. 

Shoe weight: 215 grams in a US 9.5

Verdict: I need to give them another run when it's dry. I think they are okay, but they don't wow me like the original. They feel like they might be great aggressive Half Marathon shoes, but I doubt I'd want to take them to a full. YMMV",2025-02-05 08:19:16+00:00,114,46

I live in a small town with no running store, so I've been ordering and returning shoes constantly. It's infuriating. I finally kept a pair of Altra Escalantes, just to find that after putting some miles on them I don't really love them... 

I've been running minimalist and barefoot for years. I'd like to keep to a zero drop, or close to it. I do want a little cushion, since I am training for a marathon, but don't want to feel like I am running on pillows. Ideally a larger than average toe box. I am newly postpartum and have found that my feet are still quite flat unfortunately. So, I need a shoe with some support and stability, which is new for me. 

For past marathons I've ran in Altras, but they just don't seem to have the arch support that I currently need with my flat feet. Any recommendations are appreciated!

I recently purchased a pair of Bondi 8s and Bondi 9s on the same day because I liked them both.

I lifted the insoles out of both, and the Bondi 8 has more of a rubbery type of material at the top of the midsole, and the Bondi 9 has more of a netted fabric material. I have to assume that this change is what makes the Bondi 9 squeak-free (for me). They're both very comfortable shoes. But ultimately I returned the 8s for a second pair of 9s, and walks with my dog have been quieter ever since.",2025-02-04 16:31:04+00:00,1,2

1ig2wea,bunions,Tales from Hoka Covent Garden,"So I've just purchased my first pair of Hoka marshmallows (Bondi 9's) from their dedicated shop in Covent Garden. The ladies' 6.5W was far too narrow for my bunion and just my feet in general (it was tight enough up front to squeeze my big toe under my index toe), so I asked if there was anything wider. The shop clerk said that was the widest size of the widest style they had, and admitted that the 9's were considerably narrower than the 8's and previous generations of the shoe that they no longer sell. She offered to send up the same size in men's for me to try, which I did, and they had considerably more room up front.   

In the UK all shoes of the same size have the same size number. A 6.5W in men's is the same length as a 6.5W in women's. But the men's, at least in this style, have more space up front.  Interestingly, moments after I was presented with more spacious shoes, a different clerk (the place was hopping. There were at least 10, all very busy!) provided the same solution to another woman seated across from me. This appears to be shop policy for now, offered somewhat apologetically but without awkwardness or shame.

1ig25nb,trailrunning,"Hoka Speedgoat 5, 6 or Mafate Speed 4 for the upcoming ultra (69km/2200m)?","I had Speedgoat 4 and absolutely loved them, though had to retire them at 500km mark, as foam became totally unresponsive and brick-like.

I‚Äôm currently 250km into Speedgoat 5 and it feels as if foam is already showing signs of fatigue. I‚Äôll sure keep training in them and squeezing at least 500km from them, but was wondering which shoe to buy for my upcoming April ultra - 100 Miles of Istria by UTMB (69km/2200m race, which should not be extremely technical, except in the case or rain). 

I went through literally all Speedgoat and Mafate reviews here and still can‚Äôt make my mind üòÇ

I love a bit of a more responsive (harder) shoe for road running (for instance, my favorite ever road shoe was Saucony Endorphin Speed 2) and don‚Äôt like my shoes too mushy, though I did enjoy how much has Speedgoat 4/5 dampened foot strikes during long trail runs. Fit-wise, I never had any problems with Speedgoat 4/5. For Hoka foam reference, I also have and enjoy Hoka Mach 6 as a perfect mix of being cushioned and snappy

I have relatively wide feet and 60kg so not overly heavy runner. My SG4 upper and lugs were in quite a good state when I retired them due to foam becoming completely dead. 

Now - I really like the idea of Mafate Speed 4 (130EUR) as being more responsive counterpart to Speedgoat 4/5, but some reviewers also commented it was too heavy and brick-like for them. On the other hand, as trail is not expected to be overly technical, I don‚Äôt think Mafate will have much an edge over SG, plus I‚Äôve done quite technical trail races and was satisfied witn SG 4 grip.

Second option would be buying another pair of Speedgoat 5 (90 EUR) and using them in their ‚Äúprime foam state‚Äù, ie first 100km. On the other hand, I don‚Äôt find Speedgoat 5 an exciting shoe and wouldn‚Äôt mind a more responsive foam, bc I apparently enjoy more responsive/harder foams in road shoes (yes, I‚Äôm aware trail ultras are different - not my first rodeo).

Third option is ofc going for Speedgoat 6 (110 EUR) as it was supposed to be more responsive/harder than Speedgoat 5, but the amount of bad reviews here have really discouraged me.

What do we say?

1ifye42,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Proper shoe fit?,"I recently purchased my first pair of shoes for walking/hiking trails as we plan to visit some National Parks and do some easy trails and hikes and are camping more now that we are retired. I went to a shoe store where they did all the tests to see what shoes would be best for me. I have a high arch and really wanted shoes that felt very cushy but not clunky and awkward. For reference I tried on Hokas and I didn't like the feel. I ended up buying Brooks Ghost. I have had them for 3 weeks and been out walking several times on trails in the park. I know it takes time to break in new shoes, but the next day my ankles hurt so much. Also, when I am walking up and down steps I feel like the shoes are awkward and I have almost tripped on them a few times. All of my shoes are a size 8.5. They fitted me for a size 10. I am really questioning if that is the right fit. My daughter and two sisters all wear a size 9 and tried them on and said they were way too big for them. I am taking them back this week for a replacement. Any suggestions for other brands? Anything else I need to tell the shoe salesperson? I swear my Skechers were so much better.

I went to the running store to get my feet measured and try on some alternatives and I have landed on two options with a different feel.

I usually run some easy trails, mostly forest paths that often get muddy since it rains pretty often where I live. About 30% of my runs is asphalt, I sometimes either do a quick 5k around the block or need to get to the forest by running around the neighborhood.

I like the cushioned feeling of Speedgoats and Zegamas provide a similar vibe, but Pegasus seems to be a more well rounded option.

Additionally I need to consider the fact that due to my hyper mobility I have a tendency towards sprained ankles/kneecaps.

1iftae9,sesamoid,Success stories matter when dealing with chronic pain,"Through my years of struggling with sesamoiditis, what kept me hopeful was reading success stories from others. Knowing that healing‚Äîor at least improvement‚Äîwas possible kept me going.

If you check my previous posts, you‚Äôll see I‚Äôve tried almost everything to get rid of this pain. Along the way, I‚Äôve realized a few key things:
	1.	Everyone is different. Even if two people are diagnosed with sesamoiditis, their conditions may not be exactly the same.
	2.	Treatments aren‚Äôt one-size-fits-all. What works for one person may not work for another. I can only share my experience‚Äîwhether it helps you or not is impossible to predict.
	3.	You can find the root cause. With the right approach, you can at least prevent it from worsening, and in many cases, it can be cured.

Understanding the Sesamoids

Before I get into what helped me, I think it‚Äôs important to understand the area of the foot we‚Äôre talking about. The sesamoids are two small bones in the ball of your foot, just behind the big toe. They absorb impact and assist with tendon movement, reducing stress on the foot.

If you‚Äôve found this post, you probably already know that. But what I didn‚Äôt realize until I looked at a 3D foot model online was just how many ligaments, tendons, muscles, bones, and joints surround the sesamoids. This complexity makes pinpointing and treating issues difficult.

The sesamoid closest to the center of your body is the medial (tibial) sesamoid, and the one further out is the lateral (fibular) sesamoid. Identifying which one is causing the pain is crucial because they can require very different treatments.

For me, it was the medial sesamoid, which I confirmed with an MRI. A podiatrist analyzed my gait and found that I was walking with my feet pointed outward‚Äîessentially ‚Äúlike a duck‚Äù‚Äîwhich put excessive stress on my medial sesamoid when pushing off.

What I Tried

If you want to read my full journey, it‚Äôs somewhere on the sesamoid subreddit. But in short, I tried:
	‚Ä¢	Orthopedic insoles
	‚Ä¢	HOKA shoes
	‚Ä¢	Desk duties
	‚Ä¢	Working from home for 5 weeks in a moon boot
	‚Ä¢	Daily stretches
	‚Ä¢	Ice ball massages
	‚Ä¢	Calf foam rolling
	‚Ä¢	Evening heat baths

Over time, I realized the problem wasn‚Äôt just about what helped, but how long to try something before deciding if it worked. I still wear my insoles and use an ice ball regularly, but many other things have fallen off my radar. The real turning point was realizing I needed to fully understand what was happening inside my foot before trying random treatments.

Getting the Full Picture

The first specialist I saw gave me an MRI and basically told me, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll heal with time.‚Äù A year later, still in pain, I went to a second specialist who immediately made me feel more hopeful. He recommended a CT scan‚Äîwhich, at the time, I didn‚Äôt realize was different from an MRI.
	‚Ä¢	MRI = Soft tissues (muscles, nerves, inflammation)
	‚Ä¢	CT scan = Bones (fractures, deformities)

My MRI had shown inflammation around the sesamoid bones, but that didn‚Äôt explain everything. The doctor suspected that prolonged inflammation could have softened and deformed the bone over time. A CT scan was necessary to see if the bone was deformed, fragmented, or even fractured‚Äîthings an MRI wouldn‚Äôt fully reveal.

Luckily, my scan was positive‚Äîno fractures or deformities, just severe inflammation. This gave me hope that healing was possible, but it also raised new questions about treatment.

The Treatment That Worked

At this point, the doctor suggested something called a dorsiflexion-restricting toe spica‚Äîessentially taping the big toe downward to shift pressure away from the sesamoids when walking.

I was skeptical. I had already:
	‚Ä¢	Tried specialized insoles that were supposed to offload pressure.
	‚Ä¢	Worn a moon boot for 5 weeks, fully immobilizing my foot.

But the moment he taped my toe for the first time, it was like a different foot.

Does it make you walk funny? Yes.
Does it make other areas of your foot hurt after a while? Yes.
Does it rip out tiny foot hairs and leave your skin irritated? Yes.

But did it make an instant difference? Absolutely.

Final Thoughts

Sesamoiditis will not heal quickly‚Äîit could take a year, two, maybe even five. But I now know that it can heal. And I hope yours can too.

If you want to try the toe spica taping, here‚Äôs a video tutorial (https://youtu.be/l_4HESXCG40?si=eHTdQe_hfF3TDvaP). In the video, she only puts one piece of tape on, but I recommend putting 2 or 3 on, overlapping them by around half a centimetre each time. The idea is to offload the sesamoids, so depending on how deep the ball of your foot is will depend on how far down you need to point your toe with tape. The tape I use is this: First Aid 4 Sport Premium Tan Zinc Oxide Tape | Zinc Oxide Tapes | FirstAid4Sport  (25mm version). It‚Äôs really strong and lasts a while. Replace every 24 hours and let your toe breathe for a couple hours or overnight in between uses.

But more importantly, before you throw every treatment at the wall, get the full picture first. See a specialist. Get scans. Find out exactly what‚Äôs causing your pain.

Treat the cause, not just the pain.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to hear your stories and discuss.

- Shoe weight preference: Light & nimble
- Prefered feel: soft ride
- Surfaces: road
- Any prior shoes you may have liked or disliked: just bought and returned Hoka Skyflow 11.5 (too heavy and mild foot and calf pain after 30miles on it) and Nike Invincible 3 11.5 (haven't even run given they're way to big for my feet and felt a little weird at the toolbox)

1ifhsb7,PlantarFasciitis,Oofos mixed review,"I wanted Oofos to work so badly. The first few days of using the slides as my house shoes was amazing. They seemed to make my feet feel even better than my tennis shoes. 

Fast forward about a month, and I had to put them away for now. I started experiencing PF in my ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù foot, hip pain, and lower back pain. When I originally bought them my orthotist who made my insoles warned me about them being too squishy and forcing the rest of my lower back to work harder in order to compensate. For this reason he warned me that Hokas are not for me either. This seems to be the issue for me. To be transparent, I have had one knee surgery and I have a minor labrum tear in one hip that I manage with PT and injections every few years. Someone with a healthier lower body might find Oofos to be the magic trick that others in this sub have found them to be.

1iecumg,beginnerrunning,How to choose first Marathon shoes?,"I started my running ""career"" about 7 months ago. I've done 2 x 5k races (PR: 26m) and one 10k race (1:01). To keep me motivated, I signed up for a half in 4 months and a full marathon in 9 months. That should give me a good focus and a plan to grind.

I am currently running on Hoka Clifton 9. They are amazin, but I'm only doing about 30 +/- km weekly (4 or 5x a week). And i figured, I cannot keep using the same pair for the rest of the year.

I want to buy a second pair, but more long-distance oriented. The problem: I have no idea about what I need or look for. 

I scheduled a fitting session in a local running store, but they ask me a lot of questions that I cannot answer / do not understand. I only know I am using going front food / middle foot (aiming more towards middle, but it's harder than anticipated).

Everything else is ... ""i don't know"" kind of deal.

Any advice that would prepare me is really welcome.",2025-01-31 11:39:02+00:00,8,16

1ie4r03,Marathon_Training,Knee issue/toe numbness/shoes??,"Hi! I‚Äôve vented about this to running friends, my running club, and a running store and I‚Äôm still not settled on a solution. 

Original Problem: left knee pain running in my Brooks Ghost 13‚Äôs 

Backstory: I ran consistently more short distance running for years - sprints up to 5k‚Äôs, lots of interval training and tempo training 4-5x a week in minimalist Merrell vapor gloves and never, ever had knee issues/toe numbness.
 
I had come off a couple years of consistently running outside of CrossFit workouts. I was building a base of mileage for my marathon training plan and averaging 10 miles total, with slight increases each week. The longest run was 5 miles. 

My left knee started to bother me and so I‚Äôd do normal recovery measures (stretching & foam rolling) after my runs but added in cold plunging/infrared sauna, and knee specific strength training exercises to get my knee better. 

It seemed to help until I went out on a 10 miles run that the running club I joined had programmed. Perhaps this was the key? Overtraining when I hadn‚Äôt established a good enough base. My knee flared up really bad after the run. And then I had a weird memory hit me of when I had attempted marathon training in 2022 and had just bought these brand new running shoes - the Brooks Ghost 13‚Äôs. And started experiencing knee pain! Same knee. 

So I‚Äôve convinced myself it‚Äôs a shoe problem and I go to the running store. They have me do a gait analysis and then stop on a measurement device to see what my foot is width, length, instep, arch, etc. 

Gait came back no issues - neutral, with a midfoot strike and no pronation. 

Foot measurement came back - wide (far right D), 8.5 measurement which equals 9.5 shoe they said, high arch, and high instep. 

I thought, wow this is fascinating information and I‚Äôm in good hands! 

Went to try on shoes and the second pair seemed to be the one. This was a New Balance 1080 v 14. They slapped in a high arch support insole since I have a high arch (never knew I did and never have had arch issues). 

The next day I go out on a run and within 1/4 of a mile all of my toes were numb on both feet. So I‚Äôd wiggle them, get a little life back in them, and run again. Kept happening within a couple minutes. So, I cut the run short and went home. I called the store and they mentioned loosen the laces as much as you can and if it doesn‚Äôt help come back in. 

The laces didn‚Äôt matter. I had them so loose and nothing. 

So, I went back into the running store the next day and they said oh it‚Äôs your high instep & the laces aren‚Äôt helping, but let‚Äôs size up 1/2. I switch out to 10‚Äôs and go home. 

The next day I go running and I can make it a little further, but still having toe numbness and also my knee is acting up on short distances now. 

I‚Äôm beyond frustrated and just want to get a couple miles in, so I run home and put my CrossFit Reebok shoes on just because. 

Guess what? No knee pain and no toe numbness! 

I go back to the running store the next day (original day Monday, second day Wednesday, and now we are to Friday). The same guy who was there Monday and Wednesday was there and I think he knew he was out of ideas because he immediately asked for backup. 

His backup brought out like 20-25 shoes and spent a good hour helping me find a shoe that didn‚Äôt bother me. It was an incredible experience and he was super knowledgeable. I brought my CrossFit shoes and showed him what I normally run in (for 400m runs up to 2.5 mile runs). 

He recommends: a lower drop and sticking with a wide toe box and not too tight of a midfoot area. 

I thought I had found the golden egg. 

I ended up getting the Hoka Clifton 9‚Äôs with my high arch support insoles. 

Next day I went on a run with them and they felt better but around 1 mile my big toe was loosing feeling. I kept at it for 3 miles but it was very distracting and kept stopping every 10 mins. Knee was actively bothering me as well. 

At home, I start thinking - is it the arch support??? 

The next day I go on a run with the arch support taken out and make it less than a mile and my left arch starts to spasm and feels like a knife is going into my foot. I limp home and put the arch support insoles back in. It still hurt, so I called it a day. 

 Two days later, I go on a 5.5 mile run with them (and arch support) and take it super slow. First few miles my knee just ached mildly but mile 4 I felt horrible. I made it through the rest of the run because I‚Äôm desperate to get miles in. I had to wiggle my toes throughout the entire run to keep feeling there. 

So, I‚Äôm curious:
- is this a beginner distance runner thing? 
- is my knee issue from the shoes or arch support insoles? 
- is my knee issue from something I‚Äôm not thinking of? 
- is my toe numbness from the shoes or the arch support? 
- would it be ill advised to buy new merrell vapor glove minimalist shoes for a marathon? (I‚Äôve heard that‚Äôs a bad idea) 

I‚Äôm desperate to run again and feel good running! I never knew running shoes would be such a huge issue! 

Outside of running, I never had any knee issues with any of the multitude of sports that I‚Äôve done. Never in CrossFit with high repetitive movements like box jumps and air squats and burpees. I‚Äôm in good shape.

I‚Äôm open to all suggestions!!! (Sorry for the novel). ",2025-01-31 02:38:07+00:00,1,3

1idaevr,AskRunningShoeGeeks,"Mods for Altra Mont Blanc, or zero-drop alternatives?","I've accepted that the Altra Mont Blanc is my almost-holy-grail running shoe. I run mostly in fair weather on pavement and packed gravel trail, so while I know this shoe has durability issues for some folks, it's held up surprisingly well for me (with admittedly intermittent use). I run so much faster in this shoe than the Escalante, which was my first zero-drop shoe, as it seems to strike this perfect balance for me of responsiveness and support. 

They don't make the Mont Blanc anymore, so I'm thinking of buying another pair while they're still available, if I can find them in my size (women's 6). My one qualm is the laces - I like the flexible upper fabric, as I have a wide midfoot and it accommodates me well, but to get a good heel lock, the laces often end up tight enough that they're digging in to the top of my foot, especially at the last cross and tie before my ankle. I've been fiddling with the tension recently, to some success, but I'm wondering, what could I swap the laces out for that will still get me the heel lock I need but that doesn't put so much tension near my ankle? 

Alternatively, I'm open to being convinced for other options. The caveat is that it has to be zero drop. I tried the Brooks Ghost Max 2 recently, optimistic to use them for a dog walking or jogging shoe, and I know they're low, but when I ran in them, they were massively uncomfortable in my feet and legs. I know Hokas are a lower drop, but I've tried a number of their styles, and they just don't work for me either. I tried one Topo model awhile back and the arch support was too high, but I'm not opposed to trying another model that's zero drop and maybe a lower arch. 

If nothing else, this is a plea to the Altra overlords: you hooked so many of us with your zero drop prowess, and you've recently been taking away all the good parts of it, and we just want the good stuff back! Thank you for coming to my TED talk.",2025-01-30 01:18:18+00:00,1,8

1id585l,AskDocs,Pain on inside of ankle when running on a treadmill,"21M, 6ft 3in, 175-180lbs


This is definitely a running related question.  I can‚Äôt post in r/running because of guidelines so figured I would give this a shot.  Pretty specific so hopefully someone has some experience in this area!

I‚Äôve been running on the treadmill a little bit recently and started having some pain on my right foot in the ankle area (Posterior Tibial).  I only notice it on my right side really, but never when I run on the road honestly.  I work at Orangetheory Fitness and run consistently on those with no pain, however they are very bouncy and much higher quality than my university‚Äôs treadmills.  

I recently switched my shoes from the Brooks Ghost 16 to the Hoka Clifton 9.  Which I don‚Äôt think would be an issue, but I haven‚Äôt had much experience with either shoe on the treadmill at Orangetheory or the school gym.  I feel like blaming the shoe would be an excuse to ignore improper form so I feel like that isn‚Äôt the answer.  

I ran 5mi no problem super easy in the Hoka the other day, and 3mi the day after.  I‚Äôm getting back into training after a marathon a few months ago, planning for a Hyrox end of May (NYC).  Because of this my training volume went up quite a bit recently to double sessions just about everyday instead of like every other or so.  I had no experience when I started running and trained about 18wk for a marathon where I went sub 4, so I don‚Äôt feel a straight novice anymore.

I feel like what might be causing this is either overtraining or poor running form (I‚Äôve never been coached on this, but no issues before).  It could be nothing, but my anxiety is spiking just because I love to run and also dropped $150 on shoes.  Let me know if anyone has any ideas or if I should talk to an actual pro or just rest lol.

1icg005,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Having a terrible time finding new running shoes. On my third pair. Need help!,"June 2023 I(F) bought a pair of Mizuno Wave Rider 27. I got these at a running shoe store where the associate just watched me walk back and forth and gave recommendations based on that. I do not remember having any issues with the shoes when I was first starting out with them. The only issue I remember is that twice, my toes went numb on long runs. Also my pinky toes rub up against the sides of the shoes. I have about 400 miles on them so time to switch. 

This time, I went to a professional running shoe store (fleet feet) and got my feet, gait, everything professionally analyzed. Twice. I am now on my third pair of new shoes and still having issues! Here is what I've tried so far:
Hoka Skyflow - super comfortable to walk in, absolutely KILLED my feet when running (mid foot, heel, ankles)
Mizuno Wave Rider 28 - these were not recommended, but I figured why not try to newer version of what I've been using. I think they narrowed them because my big toes were rubbing up against the top/side of the shoe (not the front) and kept getting a sharp pain in my left foot 
ASICS Gel-Cumulus 26 - I went back to fleet feet a second time and settled on these. So far these are the most comfortable but some of my toes have gone numb each time I've ran in them (treadmill and pavement). I'm not really a fan of the feeling of the support in the toe area. The back of my ankles have also felt like they were burning each run 

Can anyone give me any recommendations to try? From the analysis at fleet feet, I have high arches and a narrow heel. From my observance, I tend to be neutral/over pronate (most pressure is on the inside of my foot which seems to be the opposite of what others with high arches do). I prefer having a wider toe box because my toes have been rubbing together in the Mizunos I have been running in. I tend to land on my heel/mid foot as I am slow runner, rather than that the ball of the foot like faster runners. Right now I probably run around 10 miles a week, but I am training for a 14 Miler in May so I am increasing each week. ",2025-01-28 23:42:56+00:00,1,20

1ic97h9,RunningShoeGeeks,Topo Athletic Trail and Road Shoes,"Hope this is the proper place to post this review(and minor question). Be great if anyone else with experiences of Topo Athletic shoes(particularly road models) could mention how fit/sizing was for them.

# TLDR

Topo Athletic sizing consistent among trail runners(for fitting length/width), nuances in actual width along entire shoe. Road shoe sizing seems a bit narrower(ST-5 SIZE UP), and drastically different from trail runners. Trail runners using Vibram Megagrip outsoles have fanastic grip/traction. Uppers/midsoles/outsole pretty good overall.

**Does anyone have Topo Athletic Magnifly 5/Fly-Lyte 5(or previous versions), should I size up half a size? And people who own ST-5, did any of you size up half or full size?**

# INTRO

Currently I own several models of Topo Athletic trail runners and road shoes.

What I have(**THIS IS ALSO IN ORDER OF WIDEST FIT TO NARROWEST**) : 

1. MTN Racer 3 (TRAIL)
2. Terraventure 4 (TRAIL)
3. Traverse(Wide size) (TRAIL)
4. Cyclone (ROAD)
5. ST-5 (ROAD)

I came from running in mainly Saucony, Hoka, Salomon. I eventually moved towards lower drop and wide shoes such as Altra and some other brands. I found Topo Athletic as a solution for running shoes that offer some lower/mid cushioned models with low drop(0mm, 3mm, 5mm).

My main goal is finding wide toebox shoes. Perferably firmer cushion with a lower stack. Drop doesn't matter as much, but preferably zero to low.

# SIZING

I sized US 12 Men's for all models. Traverse I got in a wide version as reviews said they run narrow.

# USE/MILAGE

I have used the MTN Racer 3 for over 320km+ of running/hiking, Cyclone for 100km+ of running, Terraventure 4(Trail/Hike) for 36km trail runing, and Traverse(Trail/hike) and ST-5(Daily/Run) for less than 10km each at this time. Most of my shoes I run distances of \~1km-26km, majority of runs between 2km - 10km.

# FIT

Amongst all shoes, volume was good. Would say it is average volume, and my foot has a low-medium instep and low arch. Compared to something like a Lone Peak 9(tested fit in store), they have more volume in the toebox.

TRAIL : Between the three trail runners, there is a noticeable difference in fit. Mainly with the heel lockdown. I would recommend staying true to size, sizing up half size may be viable if you have wide heel, otherwise you risk improving toebox/midfoot and/or width/length but having heel lift. All trail runners have basically same length internally, and it is plenty(0.5-1cm extra TTS).

* **MTN Racer 3**
   * Widest Toebox, Slightly narrower midfoot, and narrow heel.
   * Very secure fit, no issues with pressure.
   * Inner heel fabric tore, perhaps due to my own wear. Repaired with Tenacious Tape.
* **Terraventure 4**
   * Wide Toebox, narrower midfoot, wide heel.
   * Heel lift would occur even with thick socks and lock lacing techniques.
   * Harder to find good lacing that doesn't pinch my instep but also doesn't have heel lift.
* **Traverse**
   * Wide Toebox(Narrowest out of all trail shoes), in a wide size. Slightly narrower midfoot, slightly narrower heel.
      * Width is approximately same/slighly narrower than normal width Terraventure 4.

**ROAD :** Road shoes seem to be really different in fit. Problem is that most stores do not carry the models I want to try on(if any), and there is limited reviews for me to properly gauge which size I should order.

* Cyclone
   * Wide toebox, slightly narrower midfoot, slightly narrower heel.
   * Width is between MTN Racer 3 and Terraventure 4, probably closer to latter.
* ST-5
   * Narrow toebox, same width midfoot, slightly narrower heel.
   * Fit would probably be same as trail shoes if sized up half or full size.
   * Significantly shorter internal length/width, at size 12 the inside of toebox has slight taper which bothers my big toe.

# UPPERS

**TRAIL :** All uppers are practically the same. Very nice flexible mesh that is tight and kind of breathable. I haven't tested the drainage/drying of Traverse and Terraventure. But the MTN Racer 3 faired well in drying/drainage during a long run I did where my feet got soaked several times. Traverse does come with a water resistant/quick drying insole, but I have to see how that compares to the normal insole later on.

Tounges on MTN Racer 3 and Terraventure 4 are nice and padded. Traverse is also padded but a bit shorter. All pretty comfortable.

**ROAD :** Cyclone had a very breathable yet tight upper with not much stretch, but due to its shape and sizing it doesn't cause discomfort. Heel is not padded and thin, but has a more grippy material. ST-5 Upper is nice, not as breathable but stretchier on the main part. Has a stiffer mesh on the lower upper around the toebox. Cyclone tounge thin, but comfortable. ST-5 is lightly padded tounge and comfortable.

# MIDSOLE

**TRAIL :** All midsoles are pretty similar, moderate firmness. MTN Racer 3 was pretty good responsiveness for a shoe that is 28/33 stack and no rock plate. When moving to Terraventure, it has a rock plate and 22/25 stack. It is a bit more rigid but still pretty nice for running. Traverse is 25/30 stack and has a rock plate as well, but also includes stability features which make it noticeably more rigid than the MTN Racer 3 and Terraventure 4. I'd keep the Traverse mainly for hiking use, rather than trail running.

**ROAD :** The Cyclone midsole(23/28) is pretty firm, which I like and find it very responsive. For the short time I have used the ST-5(14/14) I find the midsole is firm, but not as firm as the Cyclone. Both I would probably reserve more for short/faster runs, but the Cyclone I would use for racing(as I only have those two Topos in my road shoe rotation right now). I have used the Cyclone for a half marathon and it was great.

# OUTSOLE

**TRAIL :** All outsoles for these trail runners are the same. Same tread and same vibram megagrip. Super stuff, really good traction and grip on dirt, snow, rocks, asphalt. I am bit more confident on wet rock, but still cautious. I aimed to get only trail runners with the vibram megagrip as it seems pretty reliable in reviews compared to the Vibram XS Trek EVO offered on some less aggressive trail runners.

Additionally as I have worn the MTN Racer 3 for over 320km, It barely has worn down on the lugs and still provides more or less the same amount of grip from the rubber.

**ROAD :** Cyclone and ST-5 both have decent outsoles that grip pretty well on the road. I have ran in dry/wet/snowy conditions and I didn't have any issues with grip. For 100km it seems the Cyclone is barely worn and seem promising for many more hundreds of kilometers.

# WEIGHT

**TRAIL :** All shoes are pretty decent weight all in the 300-400g range. Terraventure 4 and Traverse are only slightly heavier but feel a bit more bottom heavy probably with the added rock plate.

**ROAD :** Cyclone is pretty light, ST-5 is super light.

Weight of one shoe(left) :

* MTN Racer 3 : \~327g
* Terraventure 4 : \~335g
* Traverse : \~350g
* Cyclone : \~262g
* ST-5 : \~221g

1ibx412,trailrunning,Footwear advice sought for ultras + urban training,"Hi all.

I‚Äôve somehow got to the stage where pretty much all my trainers are knackered, so need to replace them as I‚Äôm significantly increasing my running volume this year to prepare for the Dragon‚Äôs Back, a 6 day, 380km ultra in Wales, in September.

My current shoes:

Inov8 Roclite 275 - used these for the Cap Wrath Ultra and they were bombproof. May get another pair but Inov8‚Äôs range now is horrid (they seem to have given up designing nice-looking shoes and the range has gone back to being very small).

Inov8 Trailtalon 290 - my go to training shoe at the moment and also my choice for single-day ultras (50-100 miles) unless I know it‚Äôs going to be super muddy.

On Cloudflow - My workhouse training shoe when running on roads.

On Cloudrush - For faster road running, interval sessions etc.

Adidas Terrex 240 - got these for swimruns, not really a huge fan as they seem quite unstable laterally

I live in London so invariably do a lot of running on roads / tarmac, but also try to get out onto trails in the countryside as much as possible.

I generally prefer quite minimalist, low to mid drop shoes (5-8mm) with a low ish stack height, but am conscious that I would probably benefit from more cushioning as I ramp up the distance. I used to have a pair of Hoka Speedgoat 4s but hated the tongues which kept sawing holes into the bottom of my shins. 

Any recommendations for 

1) A training shoe for high mileages on road / tarmac (with the odd light trail thrown in around parks etc); and

2) A race shoe for ultras on trails and technical terrain (as there‚Äôs bit of scrambling involved on the Dragon‚Äôs Back).

Backstory: I tried the Hoka Clifton 9s about a year ago and loved how they felt‚Äîexcept for one problem. I have wide feet, and they caused a ton of pain on the sides, so I had to shelve them. Very disappointing since the overall ride was amazing.

1iayzkg,AskRunningShoeGeeks,New Balance 1080v13/14 or On Cloudmonsters?,"TLDR: I‚Äôm currently looking for a new daily trainer for my easy/long runs and am deciding between the New Balance 1080v13, 1080v14, and the ON Cloudmonsters.

Context: I‚Äôve been browsing r/RunningShoeGeeks for a while, so I‚Äôm hoping to get some good insights or even recommendations. My profile: 5‚Äô10, 175lbs, and a mid-foot striker. I currently have the Novablast 4 as my daily trainer, but I‚Äôve been experiencing some ankle, shin, and inner achilles soreness. Although I have begun consistently strengthening my ankles, shins, and calves, these sensitivities haven‚Äôt come up until I started wearing the Novablasts. I feel that the high stack height and drop makes the shoes a little unstable for me. The things I do enjoy about the Novablasts are the firm yet responsive ride, cushioning, and awesome colorways.

Some shoes I have tried are the Hoka Rincon 3, Hoka Clifton 9, Nike Pegasus 41, and SC Trainer V2. Hoka‚Äôs cushioning is uninspiring, the Pegasus made my calves super sore, and I‚Äôm trying to run less in plated shoes for my easy/long runs.

Now, as to why I‚Äòve narrowed it down to the daily trainers in the title:

1. New Balance 1080v13: I‚Äôve heard amazing things about the shoe on the other subreddit, mainly about the extremely soft cushioning. The drop is similar to the Hokas that I‚Äòve worn and didn‚Äôt have much issues with pain, which makes me lean towards this shoe with a similar drop. I do like that it does have enough cushion to be an ‚Äúalmost max cushion‚Äù shoe. The only thing is that I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôll be too soft and unstable, which might not be good for me.

2. New Balance 1080v14: The shoe has a higher stack than the v13‚Äôs, but I noticed from reviews that it‚Äôs a slightly firmer ride, providing more cushioning. I just don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth it buying it at full price, since it was recently released.

3. On Cloudmonsters: The shoe has a similar drop and stack height to the 1080v13 and Cliftons. I‚Äôve also heard great things about the Cloudmonsters‚Äò firm yet responsiveness ride, which is what I enjoyed in the Novablast 4. Lastly, I‚Äôve seen that heavier runners enjoy the cushioning more in this shoe, which makes me curious about taking this shoe for easy/long runs. However, I know that this shoe gets a bad rep in this subreddit.

I know this is a very specific question, but if you‚Äôve tried these shoes before, I‚Äôd love to get any insights about what you love and hate about these shoes! Also, if you have any other recommendations that you think would be good, happy to hear them!",2025-01-27 03:48:37+00:00,1,0

1iavbz5,Shoes,"My right heel eats shoes, need help/suggestions","Hi all, 

As the title suggests, for the last 3-5 years I've noticed that my right shoe always tender to wear out more quickly than it used to. Specifically in the area inside the shoe at the back that supports the heel. Depending on the shoe design/durability the material will be worn down and plastic support exposed anywhere from 3 to 6 months. It used to be 6 to 12 months, but over the last couple years it became more noticeable. 

My first solution was to switch from regular tennis shoes to ""work shoes"" that tend to be more durable with steel toe or composite toe. I bought a pair from Red Wing and they lasted about a year. I went to replace them and found out they were discontinued so I went right with the replacement ones they recommended. After about 4-6 months the plastic became exposed again and started cutting/rubbing into/against my heel. Obviously, very uncomfortable. 

I got another pair, and they lasted about 3 months before the material started to noticeably wear. I got tired of paying so much money for shoes that wouldn't last. So I went with Crocs for the last year. While comfortable, they don't provide much on the way of support, and I've been spending more time on feet at work lately then not. So, I went and saw a podiatrist. They did an exam and noticed the heel of my right foot doesn't have much muscle mass compared to my left foot. After an X-ray and MRI both came back as ""unremarkable"", meaning nothing of note observed. I have a follow up appointment in a couple weeks, but the general consensus seems to be that they aren't sure what to suggest other than trying some kind of weird tape.

I asked about prescriptions for shoes as I had a veteran college classmate several years ago mention that the VA had written a prescription for shoes. The podiatrist said that those shoes are for diabetics, but that some VA doctors might be willing to write a prescription regardless of if you are diabetic or not. 

I went to a shoe store that the podiatrist recommended and I ended up going with a pair of Hoka's that felt very supportive. Has anyone else had this problem and/or have any suggestions for some shoes that my foot won't eat? Or at the least, has more padding/material in the heel support department?",2025-01-27 00:42:00+00:00,1,1

1iarn82,Hoka,Trail shoe equivalent of bondis‚Ä¶,"I‚Äôve been using bondis for a few years now in 2E size which are great for my hallux rigidus. I use one pair for day to day and another pair for running. Mainly dry trails and canal paths but for wet muddy trail runs they have no grip (no surprise!)

I tried the speed goats which had excellent grip in the mud but after each run my knee hurt, they definitely didn‚Äôt feel as cushioned so I think this was causing my knee pain. 

I think my only other options are the challenger  and the Stinson but it looks like the challenger isn‚Äôt as plush or supported as the bondi and the Stinson is a stable shoe and the bondi is a neutral shoe so may cause me issues?

I was wondering if anyone else had similar dilemma as me and what the eventually settled on? A shame there is no bondi trail version as that would be perfect!",2025-01-26 21:54:50+00:00,1,1

Hey y'all, I found a pair of these heavily marked down Mach X's for $70 CAD. I'm a size 10US M, but decided to give these 10.5 shoes a try, and surprisingly they were more snug than my other size 10 shoes! But still had some room. Took em home, tried em on again, and turns out, they're 10.5 W and now it feels like I'm starting to get in my head a bit (the pink tongue should have been a big tell but I just thought it was funky Hoka colourways lol).

Heel lock down is great, and the midfoot is comfortable. Toes can wiggle a lot, and there's a thumbs width between my big toe and the front; It doesn't hurt walking around the house in them. But of course normally, I'm a 10 M, and these are basically? a 9B M. They truly are comfortable so far, but I imagine once I start running and my feet swell these would be a no go. I want to give them a run, but once I take em outside I can't return them. These would mostly be for speed work and hill repeats. Should I keep these around or would I regret running in shoes that are narrower?

1iafruv,AskRunningShoeGeeks,Marathon Shoe Help!!,"I‚Äôm preparing for my (first in 12 years) marathon and things have changed! Years ago, I loved my Nike Lunarglides and the discontinuation of those sort of synced with New Balance coming out with their Fresh Foams. I made that switch, had kids and now coming back to running the last few years I‚Äôve been running almost exclusively in my NB 1080s (v13, 14) hasn‚Äôt made a difference, I love these shoes! 

Ive bounced around with some Hokas and am currently trying out a pair of ASICS Super Blasts that my local running store assured me would be a great marathon shoe - took them out for 12 miles and came back with my first black toenail in years. Wondering if it‚Äôs fit because I sized up another half size to accommodate my wide feet and could feel my left toe next to my big toenail banging the whole time. I‚Äôve lost this toenail several times in the past so I know this feeling well. But honestly, I can‚Äôt size down in them or the toe box just will not accommodate my foot. I also noticed the Super Blasts sort of clopping along the whole time, which makes me think the fit is wrong.

My local running store advised me that my 1080s would not be a great marathon shoe and that I should make the switch to something lighter because I am noticing quite a bit of heel drag in them after 10 or so miles, but I can deal with that when everything else feels comfortable.

My question is do I stick it out for a few more runs in the ASICS Super Blasts or do I need to take them back now? Is there a New Balance shoe that is more marathon appropriate? I‚Äôm trying for a 4-4:15 finish so I don‚Äôt need anything particularly speedy or plated, just something to carry me through at an easier pace. ",2025-01-26 14:24:13+00:00,1,3
1ia5h11,trailrunning,"TNF Vectiv Pro 3 and Vector Sky 2
- Initial impressions","Posting this, as there isn't much out yet. There will be undoubtedly be more thorough reviews than this coming out soon.

**Vectiv Pro 3, size 9**

* Surprisingly light given the size
* They are rather bulky shoes, imo
* Rocker not super pronounced, but noticeable to make for a fun ride
* Fantastic lockdown, aside from roomy toebox (a sizing issue by me)

Tbh I never ran trails in them and I ran very few miles in them. People should really try these on and make their own impressions. This is a **MASSIVE** disclaimer.

I  think these would be great for moderately technical trails, possibly up to more technical trails.  The lockdown, as I put above was quite nice, and I can see this really helping them on technical terrain. My sizing issue possibly exacerbated my notion of them as bulky shoes; I definitely should have gotten an 8.5. I had way too much space in the toe box. But in general I prefer a more sleek shoe, which these did not feel like. For reference I really love the Terrex ASU, having used them on several runs, they feel like they want to go fast.

I did back-to-back road runs in these and my Tecton X3‚Äôs and these felt like much more shoe. Tectons felt slim but more ‚Äòflat‚Äô and less fun in comparison. However, my speed/effort was roughly the same and I found it easier to pick up the pace in my TX3's. The Pro 3‚Äôs, from my brief time using them, seemed to want to cruise along better. If did more/ longer/trail runs in the Pro 3, I would have a more nuanced analysis.

Ultimately returned then, couldn‚Äôt justify keeping them when my Tectons check enough similar boxes (plated high stack trail super shoe) and the ‚Äòwow‚Äô factor was not fully there. I was incredibly torn about returning vs keeping these,  but I really prefer shows that feel more nimble. From my limited time using these, I would choose ASU's over these, because I value pure speed > stability.

**Vectiv Sky 2, size 8.5**

* Hugs foot nicely, great lockdown
* Kind of feel like Terrex ASU ‚Äòlight‚Äô (rocker less¬†pronounced, noticeably less stack/cushion, more stable)
* Feels very nimble
* Relatively firm ride

Ran a snowy/grassy mostly flat non-technical 5km in them. They are very light and snappy. Traction was pretty good. Tbh no crazy ‚Äòwow‚Äô factor, just very nice shoes. Ran 6km more on gently rolling grassy/snowy trails and got into a nice cruising pace, mid 6‚Äôs per mile. Picking up the pace felt quick. Aiming get some more technical trails next weekend and I'll update here (unless I forget üôÉ)

**Other shoes I have/have worn, for** reference

Trail

* Tecton X3, 9 (fits well)
* Endorphin Rift, 9 (too loose, esp toe box)
* Agravix Speed Ultra, 8.5 (fits well)
* Normal Kjerag, 8.5 (fit well)

Road

* Hoka Mach X2, 9 (fit well, I love these shoes)
* Takumi Sen 10, 9 (fit well)

For context, I weight train every day and I love to do cardio and can usually run forever, so walking is no problem.  I'm leaving to Japan soon and I have a deep anxiety related to the lower back pain I got the last time I was there (3 months ago).  I was pushing 30-40k steps) and I developed a terrible lower back pain on my second or third day wearing **New Balance 1906.**  I was looking for a balance in fashion and comfort and I figured a sporty shoe should be perfect for walking comfort. 

After the 3rd day, I couldn't walk 1000 steps before my lower back pain would kick in.  I left my backpack at home, I tried stiffening my core, pointing my chest to the sky, and even buying Hoka Clifton 9s midway through the trip but the damage had already been done.  It did help a bit, but it would still kick in.

I purchased Nike Vomero 5s and after walking around in office, I notice that the heel box is really stiff similar to the 1906s.  I really fear that may be why my lower back pain is activated, or since I usually wear flat shoes, the heel to toe drop is throwing my alignment out of wack.

1i94ol5,BeginnersRunning,Need advice for healing legs while running,"This post is going to require a bit of context but i really need advice from people with first hand experience because i am out of my depth.

I am a moderately active and in shape person, i weightlift 5-6x a week. I go on hikes about every 2 weeks.

During Covid I got really into running because I could not go to the gym and weightlift

I would run about 3 miles a day and walk another 3 after maybe 3-4 times a week. I really enjoyed it but I did not build up into this volume of running in the slightest and my shins payed the price for it. 

Fast forward to the start of 2025, I have tried to get into running several times since then because I enjoy it but every time I did i experience immense shin pain and inability to tilt my toes up the normal extent.

One of my new year‚Äôs resolutions this year was to seriously commit to running again as well as healing my shins in the process. I have been running on the treadmill at the end of every other workout. I have been slowly increasing the distance and pace every run, my most recent was 2 miles at 8:00 min pace. My left shin does not give me trouble anymore

However my right shin still experiences fatigue and slight pain, by the end of the 2 miles I can only tilt my right foot up half the normal amount if that. My left knee has also started to experience ‚Äúrunners knee‚Äù and experiences some slight pain not while running but the following days

After my runs I do some stretches for my shins which is what I think has healed my left shin. 

I am extremely frustrated because I could run for way more than 2 miles with how in shape I am but the pain in my left knee and right shin wont allow it.

Looking for advice on how to continue running while healing/ adjusting my knee and shin.

Feel free to ask any questions if you need more information.

I recently tried Speedgoat 6 in wide, and I generally like them, but after a 70-minute run with about 2k ft of vert in the Marin Headlands, my pinky toe is kind of busted (even with heel lock lacing). Curiously, I ran up Mt. Tam (\~2500 ft, 3.5 miles) then back down a rather steep trail and didn't have issues.

I ran the Double Dipsea (14.5 miles, 4.4k ft vert) in the Saucony Peregrine 13 (wide) and got bad blisters on my heels (even with heel lock lacing). I still wear the shoes for long walks on the weekends and like them -- just didn't seem to do well on all those stairs.

I haven't had much luck with Topo or Altras.

Any recommendations? ",2025-01-23 22:57:23+00:00,4,12

1i5x323,sesamoid,Help understanding MRI results ,"Hello! I‚Äôm a 22 year old pretty active female and grew up playing pretty competitive tennis my whole life as well as started running and completed my first half marathon in September of 2023. I was training for my 2nd in December 2023 when I injured my LEFT foot (sprain I believe) and stopped running for a while. I started running again with low mileage in early 2024 and felt pain in my RIGHT foot so I stopped completely and just did usual activities in the gym such as cycling, running 1-2 miles on the treadmill, strength training and playing tennis frequently. 

Fast forward to August 2024, I started feeling milder pain in my right foot and just thought it was regular soreness and overuse and didn‚Äôt pay much attention to it till in December, my right foot because extremely swollen and I could not put any weight on it essentially. Since then I have seen a podiatrist who diagnosed it with sesamoiditis and prescribed orthotics. I saw an orthopedic surgeon for a 2nd opinion and got an MRI. I‚Äôve attached my XRAY and MRI report which I need help understand - it shows a small crack as circled. He said no impact activities for couple weeks and orthotics as well. My pain is about a 4-5 and I definitely feel it if I walk too much or flex the toe. He also recommended sesamoid surgery which is why I don‚Äôt fully trust him since I know this a really tough surgery to recover from and this hasn‚Äôt been going on super long, I‚Äôve switched to wearing sneakers everywhere as well as hoka recovery slides in the house. Also as background, I am super tight and pretty inflexible and wondering if this has anything to do with it which is still a work in progress. Any help would be much appreciated!

1i5ovv0,PHRunners,After months of trying different sneakers out i settled on this,"Just starting out again (last ran as a hobby pre pandemic pa) but have had set my mind on buying a new pair of running sneakers but nothing really spoke to me.

Q2 last year i bought a pair of newbalance fresh foam more trail v3 thinking id use it for running when i had time. Took it to a few travels and concerts and while i really liked how squishy and easy it was. I always hated using it for long walks. In the end i realized i wanted something with more support.

After my last concert and trip 2024, i finally called it quits and sought for a pair to replace them (at least for traveling needing long walks. For the past few months ive been trying out any brand with running models. Jumped from asics to hoka to oc to brooks to nike, nb etc. tho while they had some very comfy models something felt wrong using them.

Fast forward to yesterday while exploring a local mall ive never been to, i stumbled across an adidas factory outlet. Thinking id buy some fun cheap sneakers. On the corner of my eye i found an ultra 4d asked the staff if they had one my size  but sadly only had a half size too small. Decided to take a spin at the womens section what they had. Found an all black 4dfwd 3 asked them for one my size and surprisingly they had. Tried it out walking and jogging. I was shocked by the amount of feel i was getting from them. I was very impressed that i finally found something that spoke to me (i did fine them a bit too stiff around the mid to toe they‚Äôd probably go away after breaking in). While they were quite a bit bit more than what i planned to splurge, nothing else spoke to me like them. Told the staff id buy them and while in queue at the cashier i decided to take a look at their newer offerings. And confusedly they had a 4d fwd my size just sitting there. Rushed to google to see what the newest model was and was impressed that it had already reached a 4th iteration (i have a 4d fwd pulse 2.0 that i bought on a trip a back in 2023). Rushed to the cashier to confirm the model of the pair i was gonna buy and it was the older 4d fwd 3. Asked them to kindly cancel the purchase and instead get the 4dfwd 4 instead.

Tried the 2 out before confirming and the difference while minimal, it was noticable with the 4 being a bit softer and bouncier than the 3. Decided to buy the 4 and sad to say i had to pay full price because it wasnt on sale :/.

Once i got home i fired my treadmill up and took it for a few kilometers. It was such a joy to use them! It felt like i was gliding and it was very natural for me with no breaking in needed!

So as of writing this, ive done roughly 40kilometers with them. And i am in love! No knee pain unlike the new balance‚Äôs nor get bogged down by the weight on my pulse 2.0. It just feels natural and smooth. Turns out i found the one with stacked foams to be too muted for me‚Ä¶

Tl/dr: bought a very comfy max cushion pair > hated how unstable i would feel with the cushion (knees and heel would always hurt) > went to adidas factory outlet > tried a few wanted to spend less than 5k > ended up buying a pair at full price :,) > loved running again.

1i50qsy,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Bondi 9 first impressions ,"M. 6ft2. 85kg. Mar 2:57. HM 1:26  
Other shoes I use/d (some have been retired/sold on) . Hoka Mach 6, Puma Deviate nitro, Puma Magmax, Hoka Cielo x1, Saucony Triumph 20, NB SC trainer v2, On cloudsurfer

First thought on the Bondi 9. 
Took the Bondis out for an easy 6km recovery run at 5:30 (min/km) pace today.  

Fit: went normal Hoka size and fits fine (I find Hoka is a half size small though compared to other brands so I go half a size up if you‚Äôve never tried Hoka on before). I would say it‚Äôs maybe ever so slightly shorter than my other Hoka‚Äôs but not an issue. 

Ride: I read somewhere that the midsole now uses the same/similar midsole to the Mach 6 and to be fair I actually thought it had a bit of similar feel under foot to the Mach. Now obviously it‚Äôs a lot bigger and heavier so won‚Äôt be the same use case for the shoes but the softness/compression/bounce is similar between the shoes. Best way I would describe them between the 2 is if you‚Äôve ever bounced in a trampoline - if you bounce in the centre you‚Äôll notice it‚Äôs a bit smoother and ‚Äúlonger‚Äù of a bounce and less of a instant reaction (that‚Äôs the Bondi). Whereas if you go slightly towards the outside of the trampoline it‚Äôs a ‚Äúquicker‚Äù/shaper reaction and bounce (that‚Äôs the Mach), it‚Äôs a similar feeling but slightly different. An imperfect analogy but sure you get the idea. 

Upper: very plush. Has a lovely step in comfort feel but does have a lot of padding so think could be a warm shoe in hotter climates. Very comfortable though. 

Weight: I don‚Äôt know what the exact weight is but in the hand does feel heavy, but on the run actually didn‚Äôt seem too bad. I am running on very tired legs after a lot of mileage recently so that‚Äôs definitely effecting it but overall I actually didn‚Äôt find it to bad in terms of feel on foot. 

Expected use case for it: I got the shoe mainly as an easy day/recovery day shoe and think will probably slip in there perfectly (suspect will also use it for my easy long runs as well). I do also have a 100km road ultra coming up so starting to figure out which shoes I will be using for that (also a reason I picked these up to both baby the legs and see if these could work for it). 
Off first impression not sure if these will be for that. Will see how they break in but would probably like to go for something a little lighter on the foot (both in terms of actual weight and general padding to let my foot breath a bit more). 

Most similar to in terms of competition: from what I have tried I think they very similar to the Puma Magmax. I think the Puma would be a bit better at picking up the pace while the Bondi will probably be a bit better as cruising speeds but that‚Äôs just off my initial impressions. 

Will revert once have done more distance in them to see how they hold up.

I currently have the Bondi 8‚Äôs and they‚Äôre fantastic, but i wore them too much and now they don‚Äôt work. should i buy these again? or should i go for the 9‚Äôs or another style? i don‚Äôt really work out ever, i get it mostly from how on my feet i am. advice would be great, tysm!!!

Here is a detailed album of all items. All sizes are in men's. Any questions please ask.

That said, some details:

**New Nike Vaporfly 3 sz 10 $145 shipped.** Bought these from another user on here. Odd fit for me so selling at a slight loss. Only worn on carpet to try fit.

**Gently Used Hoka Zinal Trail (v1) sz 9.5 $45 shipped.** So, I found these at Goodwill about a week ago. They looked in great shape and were $15. Tried them on in-store and thought they fit. They don't; just a tad too narrow. Seems like a decent shoe. I ran them through a gentle wash and wore them once after to confirm.

**~~Very Used Adidas Adios Pro 3 sz 10.5 $30 shipped.~~** ~~Same deal as the Hoka above, though not nearly in as good of shape. Found at Goodwill for $15, tried them on. Were big, but thought I could make it work. I can't. I believe they still have life left from a quick rigidity test, but the rubber is worn on one shoe. If you were curious on a AP3 but unsure on overall feel, maybe this is a good way to test. I'm just selling at cost + shipping so if no one bites I'll just keep for some use.~~ SOLD

**Used Lululemon Surge 4"" Short sz Small $28 shipped.** They are this specific model: [https://www.lulufanatics.com/item/40355/lululemon-surge-short-4-updated-heather-allover-iron-blue-true-navy](https://www.lulufanatics.com/item/40355/lululemon-surge-short-4-updated-heather-allover-iron-blue-true-navy) Found these at another store. Thought the size small would work. The liner is just a bit too constricting for my liking. They seem like very nice shorts and wish they would work for me.

**Gently Used Nike Dri-FIT ADV AeroSwift Racing Pants sz Small $50 shipped.**  I am the original owner of these for the past year. Bought thinking they'd be a nice piece, but the fit is horrible on me (I'm 5'6"" 132 with a 28"" inseam, and they're way too long). Worn about 5 times total.",2025-01-17 18:54:59+00:00,0,3
1i3lcfq,PlantarFasciitis,My PT recommended I get Stability Shoes / Stiffer Insoles Wanted - PF Pain ,"I have suffered from PF in my left foot for over a year.  I've tried a lot so far and my physical therapist I've been seeing recently said my overly cushioned Hoka shoes could be an issue and I should try something more like ""stability"" shoe with a stiff insoles and try walking and maybe running in those.  I believe his logic is that Hoka's and similar are so cushioned that they create unnatural gait for people and that can counterintuitively worsen the PF.

I exclusively trail run and love my topo ultraventure 3‚Äôs. The first day I bought them, I put them on for a 14 mile run and had no break-in period. It‚Äôs a work horse and my trusted long distance trainer. However, it feels like there‚Äôs no bounce or spring to my step and lately I‚Äôve been wanting more of a speedier responsive shoe as well. I tried the HOKA mafate and my toes were numb the entire run. I got used to and really love the wide toe box of the Topos.

1i2zk5d,PlantarFasciitis,"Plantar Fasciitis, Nerve Entrapment, or Both?","Heyy team! I‚Äôve been dealing with severe heel pain since April 2024, and I‚Äôm at a loss for what‚Äôs causing it. I've seen 3 foot/ankle doctors and 5 different physical therapists, and they all point to different things without any real answers or improvement. The pain started in my right foot and gradually intensified over two months before showing up in my left foot as well, in the exact same place.

The pain is on the medial side of both feet, around where the medial plantar fascia attaches and near where the plantar nerve comes around the inside of my ankle. Touching the area makes the pain MUCH worse, and stretching or rolling my feet and calves doesn‚Äôt seem to help at all. I've tried night splints (no change) and nerve glides (no change), and strengthening my foot/ankle with band work, calf raises and all sorts of mobility and toe yoga (again, no change.) Although the pain was livable this summer if I wore the right shoes (Hokas) and kept on my daily NSAID game, now the pain is so bad I can hardly walk regardless of footwear.

Candidly, I'm in a really bad spot emotionally with it because I had to have knee surgery 5 months ago for an unrelated injury, and being non-weight-bearing during recovery made my foot problem so much worse. I'm struggling to do my mandatory knee physical therapy, and I feel like I've dug this hole for myself that I can't get out of. I'm 31F and am a healthy weight, eat healthy, and (other than some knee injuries from playing competitive soccer) haven't had any health issues until this whole incident.

I‚Äôm trying to figure out if this sounds more like plantar fasciitis, nerve entrapment (like tarsal tunnel syndrome), or possibly a combination of both. For those who‚Äôve experienced similar symptoms, what helped you figure it out? I really want to avoid getting an MRI because of the expense, but ultimately I might need to soon.

1i2by2l,PlantarFasciitis,Almost healed - 2 simple tips to help you,"Hi all.
I had been suffering with this for months and whilst there's a lot of info on this thread I'd like to just add 2 simple tips which should help a large portion of sufferers.

1. Lose weight- aside from the obvious benefits, excess weight puts more loads on to the feet and can cause more inflammation and overpronation making recovery harder. Download myfitnesspal and track your calories. 

2. Gym - Do a leg strengthening routine twice a week at the gym. Hit your hamstrings and calves mainly and make sure to stretch these out throughout the day also. 

These tips don't cost much so make sure to try these before spending too much. There are things that worked for me along the way such as hoka recovery slides and a arch support insole to prevent too much overpronation, but be sure to try the 2 above points and you can save yourself money and time.

1i27kep,FootFunction,Sharp pain under left big toe when putting pressure on it or standing on my toes,"So.. lordt-- I never thought I would be posting on this site, but here I am. And TG for reddit because it has supplied me with so many answers/help these past 8 months, and I didn't feel alone in this current struggle. So thank you all. I'm also 30 years old, F for context.

Anywho, lets get to it. So back in early June 2024 I went to a concert it was GA and I was standing for maybe 10-12 hours total that day on my feet, I had on (possibly 2 inch?) Chelsea boots that day, truly nothing crazy and my foot wasn't really even in pain except for the usual swelling, etc. Anyways the day after that I went out again wearing my adidas sambas walking to places as I usually do, completely fine, and then the 3rd day, I was walking, I started feeling this sharp pain under my left big toe.

  
At first it felt like a rock or ball under my toe and I just kinda ignored it because I though it was something actually in my shoe BUT IT WASN'T. Then the pain continues anytime I bared more weight on my toe. Went to a podiatrist prescribed 15 mg Meloxicam¬†for 5 days and he said rest for 2 weeks stay off it it should be fine (that it could be sesmioditis..)...there was no change really. A whole 2 months went by and I tried to ignore it, and ""rest"" some more. The pain continued. 

I finally went back to the podiatrist and he said it sounds like it could be a neuroma or capsulitis so I got an MRI, it said that I had 4 x 2 mm nodular signal between my big and second toe that is consistent with a neuroma and a 7 mm ganglion cyst at the dorsum. So I was like AH, finally a diagnosis-- its a Morton's neuroma, my podiatrist was like yep, its that lets give you a cortisone shot, so they gave me a unguided cortisone shot. My foot was swollen for a good 2 weeks, and that did absolutely nothing.

I had to travel to Japan after that and felt really defeated because for a trip I should've been excited about I wasn't because I was concerned for my foot, and not to mention my other foot had began having issues in September with what resembled plantar facilitis (possibly from me unconsciously accommodating walking on my other foot). So I invested into some Hokas, and got some inserts and that did somewhat help me along my trip.

I gave up on the other podiatrist at this point, especially now at month 6 with no change, and decided to go to another one (mainly because it started to affect me mentally and I was desperate for this to go away as it's been effecting my livelihood and my hobby of dancing and I thought after some research the best sounding solution would be Cryosurgery?). The new podiatrist, after seeing my past MRI results, said my neuroma was ""too small"" to necessarily be considering Cryosurgery on it... he suggested that it could possibly be a nerve issue, and that my nerve is compressed. He recommended I begin taking this medical food from EBM Medical called EB-A7 orally, and this foot cream P2 for Neuropathic Pain when pain flares up. YALL this sh\*\* is expensive and unfortunately insurance doesn't cover... I will say I do feel like the EB-A7 has kind of given some relief but in moments I'm also like is this a placebo effect?

I was told to meet with him 3 weeks after taking the medical food, and just recently had my appointment. I said it felt like it kind of did something but also not much. So he prescribed me Meloxicam¬†15 mg and methylprednisolone 4 mg to take WITH my EB-A7. He said that the EB-A7 takes awhile to fully kick-in, which I'm thinking he means heals this? So we shall see! 

I'm posting this here though to hear you all's thoughts and if you had this issue before or possibly know what this is, or what healed you? Anything would help!

  
SN: I've been going crazy trying to think of all the lifestyle things or what could've cause this. I have been working a desk job for over a year, where I have to sit nearly all day, and can't take breaks or move really with the specific job that I do and my glute on my left side has been killing me. Not sure if that's related though? Also have been not as active as I have usually been prior to this job (dancing twice each week every month). And gained over 12 pounds (recently lost 4), so lets make it 8! I am in the process of losing some pounds height 5'5'"", CW 181.",2025-01-15 20:56:23+00:00,1,0

1i13ca3,trailrunning,Running shoes recommendations,"   Hello guys ! As the title says I am in need of some recommendations. I live in an area where I have 5-6 months summer, 3 months (at maximum) winter, and the rest of the time is rainy. I am running daily and mostly on trail (not so technical, dirt roads -> sometimes I go 10km, sometimes I go 20 km), but to get there I run smth like 2 kms (\~1 mile) on asphalt.   
   So, I am searching for some shoes (preferably Hoka, as I never had a pair and I want to try them) which can tackle asphalt and muddy situations (this season, it's not quite snowing, mostly raining), preferably gtx (waterproof). Feet wide, but not too wide. Suggestions are welcome even for the summer, but I prefer to buy smth for this season atm.

  Thanks in advance and good luck with the mileage!

1i0eic8,Shoes,Shoes for walking that don't look like walking shoes,"Hi guys

38 male here.

So, I have back pain issues, nothing really serious i.e. no injuries or anything but walking more than 30-40 minutes often makes the situation worse and I was told by my ostheopath that shoes make a difference (which is kind of obvious). He recommended wearing technical sport shoes of the like of Hoka or similar but I find them horribly ugly lol and anyhow they don't really fit my style at all, I'll get them if I'm forced because health is more important than style but right now I was looking for an alternative that I can actually wear. 

The type of shoes I normally wear is leather boots, Chelsea boots, Timberland, I have some trainers but quite vintage (Puma or Reebok). I don't mind hiking shoes if they don't look too much like hiking shoes. So pretty classical, casual, men's shoes really. I'm afraid that anything too technical in the look will make my spirit cringe. 

Does anyone have an advice for a man's shoe that is both really comfortable to wear, has good soles for the posture and for waling long periods but doesn't look like I'm about to run 100 m at the Olympics or climb Mount Everest? 

I was thinking about Birkenstock for example, any good (or bad) experience?

1i0264a,RunningShoeGeeks,ASICS Nimbus 25 ,"Time to start off the new year with a fresh pair of shoes. Previously I had the Novablast 3 during a 16 week training block for an ultra. I loved them, super light and great for both long/easy runs and speed work. With them now pretty worn I decided to go for the Nimbus 25. 

Initially impressions after 100km:
- heavier than what I expected, certainly heavier than the Novablast 3 and Hoka Mach 5 I‚Äôve used. 
- comfortable, a touch on the narrow side but not so much I needed to size up. 
- struggle to do speed work in them. They feel a bit too squidgy (if that‚Äôs a word) for any sort of tempo work. I find them a bit energy zapping when I try pick up the pace (anything faster than 5:00min/km) 
- On Easy runs where I‚Äôm purely focused on zone 2 or recovery they feel really nice and plush. 

I‚Äôm usually not one to rotate my running shoes for easy/long to speed work. I like to try grab an all rounder if possible but I think I may need to do that with these. On race day I wear a pair of Nike Vaporfly 2‚Äôs. 

So the jury is still out on the Nimbus, a nice shoe no doubt but as an all rounder I still prefer the Novablast 3. ",2025-01-13 01:03:58+00:00,132,73

1hzo7k0,RunningShoeGeeks,PUMA Deviate Nitro 3 ,"I need a reliable pair of shoes for winter running alongside my Hoka Speedgoat 5s and I‚Äôve read a long of good things about these from Asics Novablast users so when I found some for ‚Ç¨115.00 I didn‚Äôt hesitate and bought them immediately.

# Fast facts

* User profile: M, 180cm, 70kg
* Shoe size: 28.5cm in all brands; EU44 in PUMA
* Average weekly mileage: 60-80km
* Running style: neutral; fore and mid-foot striker
* Run used: long runs (\~4:50-5:30/km)
* Terrain ran: dry and wet road (concrete, asphalt, cobblestone), muddy light trails

# Thoughts

I was a bit worried to try them immediately for the first time for a long distance of 13 miles but they proved to be amazing and I didn‚Äôt feel any discomfort throughout the entire workout.

# Size and fit

As expected they fit perfectly to my feet and I know that my preferred running shoe size is 28.5cm so PUMA‚Äôs EU44 is what I chose. I still have the same one thumb of space between my toes and the tip of the shoe but the latter definitely is tapered or narrow compared to others of the same size. Fortunately that detail wasn‚Äôt a problem at all during my run.

# Ride

The DN3s have a carbon plate and even though it had glowing reviews online I was still expecting one of these three things:

1. There will be foot pain after a few kilometers because of this plate the way I did with Saucony Endorphin Speed 3‚Äôs nylon plate;
2. The plate would be felt but overall will be as lackluster as Velocity Nitro; or
3. I will experience the positives that everyone claims it has.

As mentioned before I tried these for 13 miles of moderate effort (\~4:50-5:30/km) and overall it was comfortable and fun to run in. I observed that the narrow tip became more noticeable as I went faster and with more cadence but not to the point of instability especially on the wet surfaces and cobblestone paths on my route. I didn‚Äôt feel like I needed to adjust anything in my foot landing with this point but this might be something to consider for other people.

# Performance

I actually used them first for a 5km walk the day before and one major issue I felt was that the upper is a bit breathable so my toes (only the toe area) felt cold despite the thick wool socks I have on. I was going to wear two layers of socks for my run and I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt push through because my toes never felt cold during the run (-2¬∞ to 0¬∞C). I will take note of this in the summer if it feels warmer (or even sweat) with the same cotton running socks I use everyday.

To be honest I was expecting to feel the in-your-face bounce and responsiveness attributed to plated shoes on my first try especially coming from the non-plated, regular Speedgoats but there were only minimal as far as my experience. I believe that I have to break-in the Nitro foam up to 50km as some of the reviewers say to fully appreciate the technology.

On the other hand It was easy to change my pace and cadence depending on my mood throughout the workout and even though it is only 10 grams lighter than the Speedgoats, it was like night and day! I liked that they ‚Äúdisappeared‚Äù from my feet as I went faster and I didn‚Äôt have to do extra effort to change my form to support the speed so that‚Äôs a plus. The DN3s are fun because the tip encouraged my preferred form of fore and mid foot strikes! I would definitely choose these for speedier days when the roads are wet over my Asics Magic Speed 3s which doesn‚Äôt have the best outsole on the market.

Another positive point for me was the comfort wherein I didn‚Äôt feel my legs and feet fatigued after the entire workout. I actually expected this from new shoes but the DN3s didn‚Äôt let me down.

As for the grip, I don‚Äôt have anything else to add but praises for the consistent PUMA Grip on my routes including some light trails. This is definitely one of the best selling points of this brand and I hope they continue to innovate and improve on this technology.

# Durability

The shoes are still as good as new aside from the dirt from the light trails I went through. I will keep an eye for my next review in 500km or more.

# Overall

The DN3s are great and reliable speedy shoes for running on days when the weather outside is terrible. They can also be a trusted Swiss knife for daily, long and speed runs because of their lightness and comfort. I won‚Äôt recommend them for recovery because they tend to encourage faster cadence. Also I still haven‚Äôt experienced the famed responsiveness during my initial run but I hope I will after a few more workouts.

# Next steps

The shoes will be rotated with my Speedgoats throughout winter and it will be designated for long and speedy days of my base building plan. I‚Äôve seen reviews up to 1000km so I plan to keep notes in the midway point to update everyone and finally the end of its life once I feel discomfort.",2025-01-12 14:47:48+00:00,40,27

# Thoughts

Disclaimer: this review will focus on their performance as a road (and minimal trail) shoe.

# Size and fit

The shoes fit me perfectly and I now know my size in centimeters in all brands. I am also familiar with other Hoka models like the Clifton and Rincon series and the Speedgoats had the same ‚Äúfeel‚Äù as those two so I did not have any complaints. Actually it is improved now because I used to only buy size 28cm shoes all the time and get pain on my forefoot due to the swelling during long distances which have been eliminated by sizing up by half.

I used both standard medium-thick cotton and thick wool socks on these depending on the temperatures and both fit perfectly by just adjusting the laces.

# Ride

The shoes perform the same as Cliftons for me in terms of fore and mid-foot performance wherein there is an average amount of cushioning that I have trusted Hokas over time. It has little responsiveness and do not expect it to wow you because it doesn‚Äôt have such additional technology in the foam. I would put it‚Äôs cushioning and responsiveness to be better than the flatness and dullness of Adidas Adizero SL and Asics Noosa Tri 15 but not as great as Asics Novablast 3s and Rincon 3s.

In terms of the weight at around 280g, I did not feel it as a disadvantage and I was able to do my workouts without discomfort. I stray away from heavier shoes like Brooks Ghosts and Nike Pegasus (both historically gave me shin splits and overall unhappy experience) but the Speedgoat 5s were great! To be specific I actually do not ‚Äúfeel‚Äù the heaviness while running in them so it hasn‚Äôt been a complaint.

# Performance

After running in various weathers and road conditions over the past few weeks, I am definitely satisfied as it was able to handle them. I also love that my toes never felt any cold from all my runs regardless of the time spent outside but I assume would be a downside when temperatures get warmer.

As for the grip I did not have any problems except for icy roads which I have accepted to need spikes (or to just go to another road).

I actually used these for everything in the past 300kms for all my workouts and they definitely shone in daily and long runs. Basically they do what they need to do as daily trainers - to support the runner and provide comfort in unconventional paths which I commend them. I also used them on speedier days (< 4:30/km) but they are not fast shoes so I had to do extra work but it is doable. The only thing that I felt holding me back on such days was the little to no responsiveness and I believe if they put the Speedgoat Vibram outsoles on Rincons then it will be perfect!

I like using them on recovery days too but sometimes I have to control my cadence and pacing because as I‚Äôve mentioned, I do not feel their weight to really force me to slow down but it is not a problem.

Additionally never experienced having to break them in like other people but I suspect that my feet‚Äôs familiarity with Hokas had a contribution to this. They were good to go on the day I received them.

# Durability

At 300km I suspected them to gradually flat out like Cliftons and Rincons but they‚Äôre still good as new! As I‚Äôve said, they have average cushioning and little responsiveness and the shoes still performs consistently with the same feeling and ride I‚Äôve had from the first run.

The Vibram outsole doesn't have any distinguishable damage and the rest of the exposed foam only shows minimal wear. This is a first for me in Hoka shoes because at this point they usually have the logos in the outsole show signs of fading and the mid-foot starting to let its decreasing performance be noticeable.

# Overall

They‚Äôre wonderful winter shoes and I could not have asked for anything else! 300km and still looks and feels new is not what I expected from these but I am glad to have been proven wrong. My daily, long and recovery runs are covered without any worries of the cold and mud as long as they‚Äôre not drenched.

# Next steps

I am now in the middle of my Pfitz Base Building up to 60 miles per week plan and it will still be used for daily, long and recovery. However my Puma Deviate Nitro 3s are coming so I plan to use these for faster days and rotate with long runs.

I will continue using them up to 600km as planned unless I feel changes in the feel and/or discomfort that weren‚Äôt present before.",2025-01-11 17:23:38+00:00,21,15

1hyeffv,beginnerrunning,Finding gear for chronic blistering,"I have been running now for almost two years and no matter what I try I get blisters on outer ball of both of my feet (about an inch below the big toe on the outside edge). I have run 2 half marathons and two full marathons since I started running and the blistering gets worse as I increase to 40-50 miles per week in the training blocks, but is consistent even when I am running lower mileage.

I have gone to a pediatrist, various running stores that have sized me etc., but nothing has fixed the problem. I currently do the following:

* Foot glide on affected areas before running
* Talcum powder in sock before running
* Wear insoles (CURREX RunPro Insoles high arch) which were recommended by FleetFeet and the Podiatrist given my foot shape
* Wear Feetures Elite Max Cushion Socks
* In the past I tried using band-aids or taping that area, but it tended to make it worse

Below are the shoes I have tried

* ASICS Novablast 4
* Brooks Glycerin 20 GTS / 21 GTS
* HOKA Mach 5
* New Balance FuelCell Supercomp Trainer v2/v3
* New Balance SC Elite v4
* Nike Pegasus Trail 5 GORE-TEX

1hwczq1,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Mach 6 first run,"Back again with some first impressions of the Hoka Mach 6, my very first Hoka.

I honestly wasn‚Äôt planning on getting new shoes until at least a few months to run my ForeverRuns to the ground (currently at 400km), but I came across this deal of Mach 6 for around $65 and thought to myself screw it, I‚Äôm getting a new daily trainer lol. Here are some of my thoughts after my first few runs with my Mach 6.

Bit of background I‚Äôm a new runner with average daily pace of 6:00 min/km with ~40km of weekly mileage currently training for a HM in May‚Äî175 cm 87kg midfoot-heel striker 175 average cadence.

**Fit and Feel:**
Luckily, I watched and read a lot of reviews here and decided to get a half size up (US12; I usually wear an 11.5), and it seemed like a good fit. A bit narrow in the midfoot, but that didn‚Äôt bother me too much. It reminded me a lot of the Velocity Nitro 3, which I decided not to get because my feet overhang a bit due to the narrow platform. The same issue is here with the Hoka, so ideally, try it out in person and go for the wide version if needed.

Walking around indoors, I was surprised at how soft and bouncy they felt. The stiffness of the midsole due to the midsole stack vaguely reminded me of the Superblast, a shoe I absolutely love, so I was excited to try it out.

**The Ride:**
Did some interval workouts and a moderate 10k at my target HM pace with these. Started running and the shoe immediately felt considerably firmer. The bounce was not as noticeable as when I did the walk test, but I generally prefer a firmer shoe so it wasn‚Äôt really a problem for me. But definitely not the ride that I initially expected.

Heard a lot of praises for the rocker, and I have to say I agree it‚Äôs pretty good. Not too aggressive but really helped encourage me forward during my run. Picking up the pace felt easy and enjoyable. It‚Äôs cushioned but firm and very light which I appreciate. Overall, I really enjoyed how this shoe felt.

**The Everything Else:**
I have no complaints about the upper. I think it‚Äôs comfortable and breathable especially for me in the warmer climate. I didn‚Äôt find the forefoot volume to be cramped, but keep in mind I went half a size up in these.

The outsole, on the other hand, is not as grippy as I‚Äôd like. I ran on damp roads and pavements and felt like my feet struggled for grip a bit when picking up the pace. Not to the point of being dangerous, but noticeable enough that I got subconsciously annoyed by it. The Puma grip has ruined my expectations.

**Final thoughts:**
Overall, my first impression is positive, especially for the price. It is light, fun, comfortable, and surprisingly stable. I think this shoe will serve me well for my daily runs and speed workouts. It might be a bit awkward for recovery runs, but I‚Äôll have to try it out.¬†",2025-01-08 06:00:24+00:00,66,29

1hw3ia2,walking,Thoughts on narrowed down list of walking shoes?,"TLDR; Mind sharing your thoughts on my narrowed down list of shoe options?

I'm traveling to Japan soon (during winter) and I'm gonna be walking pretty much all day, every day for about three week! Now, I've been trying to find some good recommendations for walking shoes and I've narrowed it down to a few options but before I get a pair, I'd love to get your thoughts :D

My options:

* New Balance Fresh Foam X Hierro v8 Gore-Tex
* New Balance Fresh Foam X 880v14 GORE-TEX
* Merrell Moab Speed 2 GORE-TEX
* Hoka Clifton 9 GORE-TEX
* Nike Pegasus 41 GORE-TEX

I've been almost exclusively looking at gore tex shoes because I live in a city where it pretty much rains all year long and I'd like to be able to use whatever shoes I buy well after my trip to Japan! Plus it would be nice to not worry about rain while I'm there. Do you think gore tex is a mistake? Will my feet just get sweaty or will I stink when I have to remove my shoes in Japan?

How did I get to this list? Well, after some time I kinda got tired of looking at all the different options out there and just stuck with the ones I've liked the most out of all the ones I've seen. Also, this is my second attempt at finding the right shoes! :( I had originally bought the Salomon X ULTRA 360 GTX and the Salomon X ULTRA 4 GTX with the intention to keep one of them but I wasn't convinced by the fit and style of either of those.",2025-01-07 22:08:33+00:00,1,2

1hur875,RunningShoeGeeks,Brooks Glycerin Max Initial Review,"About me: 6‚Äô 48 yo male, 180lbs. 3:15 Marathon, 1:30 Hm, 39min 10k, 18:30 min 5k, 5:26 mile PR. 40-60mpw. Current shoe rotation: Nike AF3 (race), Hoka Cielo X1 (long/tempo), Hoka Mach X2 (tempo/daily), Hoka Mach 6 (daily/tread) and Saucony Endorphin Pro 3 for tempo/track. 

Wife bought me these as a Xmas present as an easy day/recovery/walking shoe while I work myself back from some nasty shin splints. 

FIT:  TTS (11.5) with an extremely plush upper. The tongue is fat and padded, laces work perfectly (no need for runners knot) with a wide toebox and plenty of wiggle room without feeling baggy. I do feel like the arches are a little higher than what I‚Äôm used to but they seem to be breaking in ok (see ride/midsole). The step in feel is extremely plush and exactly what I was hoping for in this type of max stack shoe. 

RIDE/MIDSOLE:  I‚Äôve taken this shoe to about 40 miles so I think I have a good feel for its intended purpose along with my personal experience. I‚Äôve done a handful of runs in the BGM ranging from tempo, easy long runs, and hills. The ride while is surprisingly springy while feeling quite nimble, despite its heft weight in my size 11.5. 

My first run was a 6mile mix tempo run ranging from 7:00/mile to 9/mile. I was actually quite enamored with how the midsole firms up at faster tempos in the forefoot. It‚Äôs not as fast or efficient as a tempo shoe like the Mach X2, but certainly can hit quicker speeds without issue. 

I also have used this shoe for some moderate hill runs with mixed paces from 9:30/mile (steep inclines) to fast efforts downhill (6:00 -6:30/mile) which again was a pleasant surprise given the range for such a heavyish max stacked shoe. 

POSITIVES: Super plush and comfy ride that can handle recovery/easy paces with some nice pickup. The DNA tuned foam is really surprising and a departure from other Brooks standard EVA foams which have grown a bit long in the tooth (similar to Hokas older offerings). It‚Äôs good to see Brooks innovate with shoes like this. Walking in this shoe is bliss for my feet. 

NEGATIVES: I did experience a mild hotspot on the left arch for the first 10 miles or so, but it seems to have gone away with time/break-in. Something to watch as I‚Äôve heard other reviewers have a similar experience. Although the shoe doesn‚Äôt feel heavy on foot, it could benefit to lose a few ounces. I‚Äôve run in both versions of the Superblast (slappy/not for me), and think Brooks could have a better, more versatile version of the SB2 with a little weight reduction. The midsole/ride is that good. 

VALUE:  I‚Äôd say if money isn‚Äôt an option, than this is a great shoe. I‚Äôll be using it for easy days, long runs, and walks. At $200 (I peeked at the receipt) it‚Äôs a little pricey. That being said, there‚Äôs a ton of other shoes that can fill this void. For me, I‚Äôm really enjoying it. 

OVERALL:  The Glycerin Max is a keeper on my rotation. I needed (wife says wanted lol) an easy day shoe that feels good on the feet for recovery yet pick up the pace. This shoe is extremely comfortable, and depending on your paces and fitness level, and shoe budget, this could be a great all rounder.

1huj932,bunions,Advice on managing my bunion until I can correct them with surgery ,"Hi everyone! I was wondering if I could get some advice about how to manage my bunion. I logistically can‚Äôt get surgery until at least December 2025 as I am in graduate school and can‚Äôt afford the long recovery time. My podiatrist said that she thinks I can manage until then and even for years after that since the way they develop is a gradual process. However, I occasionally have ankle pain and am having a hard time finding shoes that don‚Äôt cause the redness you see on my bunion in this photo. I currently wear Brooks Adrenaline in extra wide and they are the best I have found but still irritate them to have redness, although they don‚Äôt hurt. I have tried Hokas, new balance, saucony, and I just can‚Äôt find any that seem wide enough. I have been going to physical therapy for a few months now and it‚Äôs really helping me but I haven‚Äôt been there in a week because of an insurance transition and my ankle has been bothering me the past few days. 

How did everyone manage their bunions and related symptoms until they were able to have surgery? Does anyone have any advice on pain management of the ankles or finding the right shoes? And where can I find shoes that are wide enough for bunions, including more dressy shoes that can be worn for work? ",2025-01-05 22:27:34+00:00,12,28

Hopefully, this thread can easily be found so everyone can find what's right for them. If you like that idea, respond below.

If you have something productive to add to the list, please post it below.

If you have any criticisms, post it below, and I'll try to get back to you.

If you need recommendations for footwear, post your questions in THIS THREAD! People who can help can respond directly to you, and this way, the repeat questions won't be taking up tons of space on the subreddit.

>First piece of advice

Go to a store and try things on in person. There's no substitute for seeing how things feel on your own feet. What works for one likely doesn't work for the next, so you'll have to do the legwork of trying things on and seeing what suits YOUR feet. Some outfitters in some locations are very knowledgeable and helpful when it comes to assisting with footwear sizing and selection. Others, not so much.

If you don't have that option, be very careful about what footwear you order online. Do your due diligence before ordering and see what reviewers and your peers say on quality, performance, and fitment. You may have to order online, but you don't have to go on a wild goose chase.

Do your due diligence, people.

>Boots vs. Trail Runners: Which one?

Waterproof boots are better in cold weather and cold, inclement weather. They suffer in hot, humid weather because they cannot dry fast enough if submerged, and you may sweat through them quickly. They do a much better job protecting your feet from foliage, debris, and ingress of water, especially when paired with gaiters. Non-waterproof boots are better for hot, humid environments because they can get wet and dry out as you're moving.

Boots typically have a more rigid midsole, which is typically where the support comes from in a mid boot. The collar doesn't add much support until it gets around the ~7-8"" mark and/or made of thick leather. Boots like the Salomon X Ultra series offer no more support than their low-top counterparts. Boots like the Asolo Fugitive GTX and, especially, the Asolo TPS 520 GV Evo will offer loads more support. Supportive boots are better for hauling heavy packs, uneven terrain, sidehilling, and overgrown terrain.

Non-waterproof trail runners are beneficial in warm weather, dry weather, and when you need to do lots of water crossings. They can get soaked and be walked dry quickly. They're not good for harsh terrain and bushwhacking, at least, not for very long. They just aren't durable enough. Never go with GTX low-tops! They still allow the ingress of water very easily due to the low collar, and they will take a very long time to dry because the waterproof-breathable membrane will inhibit the evaporation process. You'll be stuck with waterlogged shoes.

Which one is better? That depends entirely on the wearer's use case. There is no right or wrong answer unless you're jeopardizing your safety or the safety of others on the hike through being ill-prepared. If you want to use a mountaineering boot on a flat, easy trail, more power to you. If you want to use a trail runner in the mountains, be safe but have fun. Do your research and go with what suits you best.

>Materials

Leather vs. Synthetic - Leather is more hard-wearing and durable at the expense of weight and ease of break-in. Synthetics are lighter and more flexible at the expense of durability.

PU vs. EVA midsoles - PU never loses its shape or elasticity, maintaining its original shock absorption and support for the life of the footwear. It will eventually degrade due to hydrolysis; how rapidly depends upon conditions the footwear is stored in and how often it's used. EVA is lighter and lasts indefinitely in storage, but it compresses over time, losing shock absorption and support. Note that while the EVA midsole may store well, other components of the boots may be PU or adhesives that do deteriorate.

GTX or no? - Go with GTX for cold, wet environments, environments that are generally dry but with random showers, and day hikes if the environment is not too hot. Go with non-waterproof options for hot, humid environments, especially with water crossings. GTX will keep water below the collar out, but it will also inhibit breathability and the footwear's ability to dry out. It's a detriment in the swamps but a huge benefit in subfreezing, wet conditions.

Insulation - Personal choice. It may be necessary for some use cases, such as static use in subfreezing temps, but it will also make you sweat more, requiring more frequent sock changes. This is very personal.

>Maintenance of boots

Boots and shoes will need regular maintenance to preserve their functionality and increase lifespan.

Generally, water and a nylon bristle brush agree enough. However, both waterproof and non-waterproof footwear should be cleaned regularly with a tech wash of sorts, such as Grangers Footwear + Gear Cleaner or Nikwax Footwear Cleaning Gel to remove dirt and debris.

Waterproof boots and shoes and leather boots and shoes should then be retreated with the appropriate product, such as:

Full-grain leather - Nikwax Waterproofing Wax for Leather; Grangers Waterproofing Wax; Meindl Sport Wax.

Nubuck - Nikwax Nubuck & Suede Proof; Grangers Footwear Repel Plus; Grangers Waterproofing Wax or Meindl Sport Wax (will change texture and appearance).

Suede - Nikwax Nubuck & Suede Proof or Grangers Footwear Repel Plus.

Synthetics - Nikwax Fabric & Leather Proof or Grangers Footwear Repel Plus.

Read the instructions for your footwear to see what will provide the results you most desire.

Some products can be detrimental to the health of your footwear by drying out leather, preventing conditioning, preventing resoling, rotting stitching, and overly softening leather. Research things before you do them.

>Break-in and fitment

Go with what fits best.

Boots and shoes should be comfortable out of the box with no issues, such as slippage, hot spots, pinching, rubbing, pressure, etc. They should be good to go right away. You'll still have to break them in, but there should be no initial discomfort. Break them in gradually with work around the house, followed by yard work, followed by light hikes. After one or two weeks, depending upon the boot, they should be broken-in. Some all-leather boots may take a bit longer.

Try shoes on at the end of the day when your feet are most swollen, wearing the thickest socks you intend to use for hiking. Take the insoles out if that's an option and stand on them shoulder width apart. Your feet should fit within the outlines of the insoles with no overhang or excess space. There should be ‚Öì to ¬Ω inch of space between your longest toe and the end of the insole. This will give you a good idea of the fit before you even try on the boots.

Always check the size chart before you buy! Sizing is not uniform between brands!

>Brands of footwear

The best brands and models I've discovered...

>Boots: Asolo Fugitive (men's)/Stynger (women's) GTX, Asolo TPS 520 GV Evo, La Sportiva Nucleo High II GTX,  La Sportiva Ultra Raptor Mid II GTX, Lowa Zephyr GTX, Lowa Renegade GTX, Scarpa Zodiac Plus GTX, Scarpa Kinesis Pro GTX, Meindl Comfort Fit Hiker, Extreme, or Hunter, Hanwag Tatra, Hanwag Lhasa II, Hanwag Tatra II, Kenetrek Mountain Extreme, Zamberlan Vioz Lux GTX RR, Zamberlan Vioz GTX, Zamberlan 971 Guide LUX GTX RR, and Zamberlan 972 Guide MAX GTX RR.

>Trail runners: La Sportiva, Altra, Saucony, Scarpa, Hoka.

Narrow feet: Asolo, La Sportiva, and Scarpa. 

Average: Asolo, Hanwag, Lowa, Scarpa, and Zamberlan.

Wide feet: Hanwag, Lowa, Meindl, and Zamberlan. 

Do NOT feel bad about using any particular brand! If it works for your feet and your needs, that is literally all that matters. What I and others think of your brand of choice DOES NOT MATTER! Listen to your feet!

If you need help sorting through the plethora of options and information out there, please post below for assistance from myself and your fellow hikers.

>Socks

Preface: Socks are like boots and shoes. They're very personal. They all offer a different fit, and they all cater to different needs and preferences. They all use different blends, meaning that some will have more merino wool and others will have more nylon or a similar synthetic as the primary material. Be careful when ordering and check the materials. Go with synthetics or merino wool blends. Synthetics will dry quickly and remain cool. Wool will insulate to a degree when wet and go longer before it begins to stink. More merino wool means better thermoregulation properties, especially when wet, as well as more warmth. They will be slightly less durable than predominantly synthetic socks. More synthetic materials mean the socks will feel cooler, dry faster, and be harder wearing.

Darn Tough appears to be the major force in hiking socks. They make high-quality merino wool blend and synthetic socks in various weights, heights and patterns that you can trust. They also come with a lifetime warranty should a pair fail you. They run narrow, but Darn Tough runs the brand Wide Open, which caters to wide feet and thick legs with the some quality Darn Tough is known for.

Smartwool. Following Darn Tough, Smartwool also makes high-quality socks in many weights, heights, styles, and patterns. They offer both 4-degree fit and 2-degree fit options to suit the wearer's preferences. They tend to be more relaxed in fit than Darn Tough but not loose enough that blisters are a concern. They come with a 2-year warranty, which they do honor well. The Smartwool full cushion and extra cushion socks are my preferred socks.

Icebreaker is another company making excellent merino wool blends. They also come in various weights, heights, and styles. These are also socks that you can trust.

Honorable mentions: Kirkland merino, great if you're on a budget; Farm to Feet; Danish Endurance.

Do not stack socks on socks on socks. Wear one pair of socks or one pair of socks with a pair of liner socks. However, consider liner socks if you deal with friction or if you have sweaty or sensitive feet. The liners will transfer friction and sweat away from your feet. Toi a do not want a ton of compression around your feet. That will restrict blood flow and make your feet cold. Make sure your boots or shoes are sized for the socks you intend to wear.

Buy from a reputable store. Always. There are fakes out there.

>Insoles and their necessity

Insoles provide the support you need to keep your arches from hyperextending, ankles from rolling, and they provide shock absorption foot your feet. They also keep your feet in-line. They are not necessary for all people, but they are highly useful for most, especially those with flat feet and chronic pain. The factory insoles for most boots are pretty useless, so aftermarket insoles can really provide the support you need and elevate your comfort.

>Superfeet

A staple in the off-the-shelf insole market, Superfeet insoles provide support through rigid polymer caps and firm cushioning covers. They're guaranteed for 500 miles or 12 months, whichever comes first. There are Superfeet options for many different arch heights. They also vary in volume, making them ideal for many boots and shoes.

Models

Green: High Arch. Thick. This insole provides excellent, rigid support for anyone in need of maximum arch support.

Orange: High Arch. Thick. Similar to the Green but with dual density cushioning in the forefoot for better cushioning.

Blue: Medium Arch. Thin. These insoles are comfortable for most people to wear as the arch height is very inoffensive. They also work well with most boots and shoes due to the thin design. That said, the baseplate design can damage waterproof-breathable membranes as it can dig into the liner and membrane. Keep an eye on that!

Trailblazer: Med-High Arch. Very Thick. These insoles provide maximum cushioning and med-high arch support. They take up a substantial amount of volume in the footwear, negating them as an option for some brands and models of boots and shoes. They have a gel capsule in the heel to absorb shock.

>SOLE

SOLE is known for making semi-custom, high-quality insoles that mold to the wearer's feet over the course of a few days. Thanks to the materials used, they have unique properties that make them very effective and comfortable. They are offered in three thickness: thin, medium, and thick.

Models

Performance: Made with recycled cork, these insoles quickly mold to the wearer's feet, providing excellent support and shock absorption, as well as insulation.

Active: Made with EVA foam, these insoles take longer to mold, but they're also more durable and hard-wearing. They also handle exposure to moisture better than the cork options.

Metatarsal pads: These insoles provide support for the wearer's metatarsals, relieving stress and pain for many.

>Tread Labs

Tread Labs offers insoles with various arch heights, thicknesses, widths, and levels of rigidity. They are made of two pieces: top cover and rigid base, allowing the wearer to replace only the top cover and save money. They're known for their million mile guarantee and great CS.

>Currex

Currex offers semi-rigid insoles in varying thickness and with varying levels of rigidity. They are sorted based on activity. They are fairly thin and fit into most footwear well.

>PowerStep

A favorite of podiatrists, PowerStep offers numerous insole options to suit any needs the wearer may have.

>Cadence

Slightly harder to find, Cadence offers several high-quality insoles to suit the wearer's needs.

>Fitting your insoles

Firstly, you'll need to find the insole that either matches your arch height or molds to its form.

Secondly, you'll need to find the insole length that correlates to your shoe or boot size. Most insoles are meant to be trimmed to fit. You want the insoles to match the profile of the factory insoles that your footwear included. Line up the insoles, and using a Sharpie, draw the outline of the factory insoles on the new insoles. Then, carefully cut the new insoles to match the factory insoles. Insert the new insoles into your footwear and check the fit. Always trim in small increments. You can always trim more off. You can't add any back.

>Getting used to the insoles

Wear the insoles for roughly one to two hours on the first day. If there is pain, wear them for a shorter period of time. Using that experience, decide if you will increase the amount of time worn the next day or if it will remain the same. Take your time. Do not cause yourself pain by being in a rush.

>Maintenance of insole

Replace your insoles anytime the cushioning wears down or the support begins to deteriorate. Insoles need to be regularly replaced, just like footwear.

To clean them, remove them from your footwear and clean them with a technical wash, such as Grangers Footwear + Gear Cleaner or Nikwax Footwear Cleaning Gel. Allow to air dry.

>Adjusting to your insoles

Wear them in gently and take your time getting used to it. Good insoles are just as important as good footwear. Make sure they work well together.

Enjoy your new insoles!

>Gaiters

Yes, use gaiters with any waterproof footwear to enhance its ability to prevent ingress of water. There are also non-waterproof gaiters that will prevent ingress of debris but still work well with your non-waterproof footwear.

Outdoor Research is my favorite, trusted brand for waterproof gaiters. There are other brands out there, though.

Dirty Girl Gaiters make excellent non-waterproof options. Again, there are other brands out there.

>Foot care

Make sure you have moleskin or a similar item on you during hikes. Keep your feet as dry and clean as possible. Use foot powder if you find yourself getting stinky or sweaty or enduring friction.

Change socks regularly. You do not want to keep wet socks on your feet if you can help it. It can even be a danger in frigid temperatures.

>Shopping and budget

If possible, buy from somewhere that will let you return used footwear. Don't just try things at random and waste money and resources. Be methodical in your approach.

Be careful where you buy from because fakes are out there for pretty much all hiking products. Some companies only honor warranties from authorized sellers, too.

As far as budgeting goes, this is a personal choice that depends upon what you're doing, what you can afford, and what you want to pay. I will say that your budget should be as big as you can comfortably make it to allow for the most options when trying things on.

>Realistically...

You're probably going to have to try a few pairs before you stumble across your Goldilocks pair. That's the nature of the beast. Be patient and settle for nothing less than a perfect fit. Your feet will thank you.

>In conclusion...

I hope that this has been helpful. Footwear is something that I'm passionate about because it took me a long time to find the right footwear for myself, so I've gone through a lot of time, money, blisters, and bad hikes discovering what does and does not work. If you have questions, post them below. I, and others, will try to help you find the right things for yourself.

1huc2ya,trailrunning,Shoes that can handle mud AND long distance?,"I know, I know, another shoe question. Has anyone found the holy grail of trail shoe for this time of year that can handle muddy UK trails but also long distance? 

For example, I love my HOKA Mafates for long distance / energy return, but they don‚Äôt cope with the mud, especially uphill.  (Better than other shoes, sure, but not great.)

The best shoe I‚Äôve used for actual sloppy, sticky mud is the Salomon Thundercross - but I‚Äôve found when I‚Äôm doing my long training runs (30k+) my legs end up feeling shot because they just don‚Äôt give anything back.

Also - on local UK (South) countryside trails - you will inevitably end up with periods on concrete.

I‚Äôve got shoes for summer trail running, and I‚Äôve got shoes for fell running, AND summer mountain running, but at a loss here.

Maybe it‚Äôs a bit like looking for a ‚Äùfully waterproof but also fully breathable‚Äù running jacket (such a product doesn‚Äôt exist) but keen to hear if anyone else cracked this.

1htzbhd,PlantarFasciitis,My recently healed PF and what worked (and didn‚Äôt work),"Ooh man. Have to say it‚Äôs a nice feeling waking up without that classic heel pain. I picked up PF around March/April  due to wearing old/soft shoes for basketball and I‚Äôd say symptoms really subsided in December. What a frustrating six months.

What worked:

- Visiting a podiatrist. I think people should do this right away instead of spending a ton of time researching. He instantly had a plan and recommended‚Ä¶

- Custom arch supports/insoles if this is covered by your health insurance. In the meantime‚Ä¶

- Very rigid arch supports/insoles. This made the biggest difference in daily pain. I desperately needed a stiff insole throughout the day along with a generally stiff pair of shoes. [Superfeet were the best ones I ever had.](https://www.superfeet.com/products/all-purpose-support-high-arch?variant=43158797680823&utm_source=google&utm_medium=ppc&utm_campaign=&campaignid=21573752802&utm_content=&adgroupid=&utm_term=&matchtype=&device=m&placement=&network=x&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA1eO7BhATEiwAm0Ee-HbteX3vxmOrDmOEm831VBxkV9wl0MHsMUBm4R6DuPWKdWTMvUr8PBoCQVkQAvD_BwE)

- Hoka recovery slides around the house. Expensive for flip flops but worth it. Very supportive.

- General time off of high-impact activities (pretty obvious)

- Using a roller on my hamstrings and calves daily


What DIDN‚ÄôT work very much, as far as I could tell:

- Strengthening exercises

- Going for walks

- Buying expensive running shoes without upgrading the insoles 

- Lacrosse ball massage under the arch 

- Icing 


What I learned was that my feet were basically not getting enough time to heal because as a teacher, I‚Äôm standing all day. So unless my daily work shoes had stiff, rigid support, I was going to re-aggrevate my PF daily. It took me like four months to figure that out, somehow.

1htyztj,trailrunning,I just signed up for a 100 mile trail race. üòÖ,"I (36m) do a fair bit of road running/jogging and got connected to trail running with a weekly running group in town. A couple of them have run Western States and a few more are running qualifiers each year. 

I‚Äôve run 3:12 on a flat marathon course and I did a 40k on the trails with 3k feet of elevation in 3:39. But 100 miles seems like an entirely different animal! Looking for advice/recommendations for someone who has never run further than 26.2 miles.

How realistic is 24 hours for a course with 14k feet of elevation?

I already bought some gear after talking with friends and reading through some threads on here: Hoka Tecton x3, Solomon adv skin 12, Katadyn be free water filter cap, Leki Ultratrail FX.One Trekking Poles. Emergency blanket. If money weren‚Äôt an issue what else is a must-have?

I signed up for a tune-up 50k a month before the race. I intend to use this as a trial run and my last long run, but no idea if this is a good idea. How long should your last long run actually be?

My wife and dad offered to be crew for me, but I‚Äôm not entirely sure that‚Äôs necessary since there are aid stations with drop-bags.

The race is at the end of June.

1htdbnh,RunningShoeGeeks,ASICS Superblast 2 - 400km+,"I purchased the ASICS Superblast 2 last year and have now used them in my rotation for over 400km. 

I honestly loved the Superblast 2 from the moment I started using them and still do. They are by far the best daily/long run trainer I‚Äôve used so far in my running journey. 

I‚Äôm a 39yr old male and have been running for at least 20 years on and off. My main sports used to be Muay Thai and BJJ but due to an injury last year I had to give both up and got back into running around April. Since then I‚Äôve been running steadily and fluctuate between 3-5 runs a week. 

My current times are:
5k - 19.32

10k - 40.23

1/2 Marathon - 1hr 37

Marathon - 3hr 35 (ran over 10 years ago)

The main factor for me with the Superblast 2 that sets them apart from my other shoes is that they make running so much more fun. The mid-sole has a great balance between cushion, bounce and responsiveness and can handle everything from easy runs to faster paced tempo runs. I wear a 7.5 and they fit well, the upper is light and I get a good lock down with a runners loop. 

I‚Äôve been on multiple runs with the Superblast 2 and been struggling, then when I up the pace slightly the shoe seems to give me that extra bounce I need to keep going. I find that the Superblast 2 is the shoe I reach for for the majority of my runs and I‚Äôll 100% be buying another pair. 

After 400km I still feel that they have life in them and I think I‚Äôll assess this again after another 100km. The shoe itself is in great shape after 400km, with only a little sign of wear. I‚Äôm around 66kg so on the lighter side, but I‚Äôve still be impressed on how well they have held up. 

The other shoes currently in my rotation are:
Hoka Bondi 8 - I used them for recovery runs.
 
Adidas Takumi Sen 8 - mainly used for interval and track runs. 

ASICS Metaspeed Edge+ - I use these for timed 5k/10k runs. 

I‚Äôm currently training for the Edinburgh Marathon in May and I am seriously considering  using the Superblast 2 as my race day shoe because of my experience training with them. They are expensive, but I feel like the extra cost is reflected in how great a shoe the Superblast 2, I can‚Äôt recommend them enough. ",2025-01-04 12:24:08+00:00,243,58

1hsrwjg,PlantarFasciitis,Vast Improvement This Year,"A year ago in November, every first step in the morning felt like I was breaking my right foot. I don't know what caused it, since I had a fairly active lifestyle before but the heavy lifting I did during that winter's seasonal job with ups ( did you know people ship 100lb anvils???) did righty no favors. 

Now, a year later, most mornings are pain free. I walked over 200 miles on the camino frances this fall! 

It wasn't until September so that things started to improve. Not having good access to healthcare in a very rural area, I wasn't able to receive conventional treatment but I do think some of the things I've tried made an improvement and some did nothing or worse.

What I think worked:
1. Rest. I was unemployed for 6 weeks this fall. Light puttering about was the extent of my activity. 

2. Calf raises, squats, balancing, and other dynamic strength training.  I've been consistent with one exercise or another for 4 months. 

3. Massage. Several times a day I massage the foot using a massage ball or a bic lighter to really dig into the heel. See ""the spoon trick"" on youtube, but I like a lighter better than a spoon. I also see a very talented massage therapist every month or so, depending upon my budget. My calf can get too tight to relax by myself.

4. Dynamic Stretching. Keep the flow going! Chase mountains on youtube has great routines. Warming up with a short walk first felt better than starting cold.

5. Altras. These were the shoes I used for years until I switched to a cheaper brand. Then, once pf developed, I got some hokas that redditors were raving about. I liked the squish but always felt on my tiptoes. Then my mom recommended orthofeet. I liked the slipon style i got but was always  in pain. Recently switched back to Altras  and I'm so happy I did. I don't feel like I'm about to tip over anymore. 

6. Changing how I sit. When you have pf, you sit alot! I noticed that I was crossing my left leg over my right and pressing down, stressing the tendon in That heel spot. I avoided sitting like that for a few days and noticed a considerable difference in pain.

What I don't think worked:
1. Custom inserts. I had these made on the recommendation of a general practitioner and I hated them. Too hard, no give, and I felt crippled when I put them in. Luckily I got them in Thailand so they didn't cost too much.

2. Static Stretching. I could over do it too easily and would go back to square one every week. 

Everyone's body is different, hope something here helps.

1hsl2nu,trailrunning,Replace Inov8 Mudtalon with Hoka Mafate Speed 4? Northern England running,"I've been doing a fair amount of mixed trail/ fell races over the past year using the Inov8 mud talons. Here in the North of England (Dales through Lakes), these races (10/15km-ish) tend to have a few km of road/ path running between fields, more km of rocky sections (occasionally wet or loose), running through streams, muddy sections and plenty of harder gravel paths.

I've found that the mudtalons have been fantastic for stability and grip - I almost never feel like I am going to roll my ankle, and I will continue to use them for highly technical races. However, the speed and energy return on them is awful on races like I described above. They give almost nothing on those faster, hard packed sections (road/ gravel), and the benefit of stability/ grip isn't significant enough to make up for it. I find my legs and energy levels are completely gone by the 7/8km mark. NB I am a regular road runner and do half marathons through marathons very comfortably (3:10 mara).

Thinking of replacing with the Hoka Mafate Speed 4 to give a bit more pace on those dynamic races. They would also be helpful for wetter training runs on roads during winter with ice or slushy leaves around/ slippy gritstone pavements or multi-terrain parkruns. My daily road trainer atm are the Mach 6s, I absolutely love them, but they are really struggling in the winter.

I‚Äôve always assumed I had plantar fasciitis, but I‚Äôll admit I didn‚Äôt do enough research and thought it only affected the middle of the foot when walking or running too much. Back in November, I was training for a 5k, got new Hokas, and was running on a treadmill (please don‚Äôt judge). After finishing, I noticed pain in my Achilles. I saw a podiatrist, and he diagnosed me with both Achilles tendinitis and plantar fasciitis.

I can‚Äôt stand barefoot anymore, and I was unable to walk or stand for two weeks. I‚Äôm slowly improving, but the metatarsal pain persists.

Lift weight 6-7 times a week and run 3-4 times a week. I run for fun and don't usually have an exact time goal in mind, just kinda run by feel and enjoy the good vibes ü§ò

Note 1: Some of these shoes are in women's size 10 because I just like their colors better.

Note 2: The Asics Superblast 1 and 2 won't be included in this post since I feel like they're not direct competitors with the Hoka Bondi 9.

Note 3: These are MY opinions about the shoe. We all have our own preferences so please be respectful and civil towards each other in the comment session üôÇ

TLDR: Bondi is back baby!!!

I was a big fan of the Bondi 6 and 7 but when the Bondi 8 came out, it was a very disappointing shoe for me. The Bondi 8's midsole was firm and the upper was very narrow in the mid foot area, I didn't really enjoy running in the Bondi 8 at all. The best word I could describe the Bondi 8 is ""Clunky"". However, I'm happy to report that the Bondi 9 is a much better shoe than the Bondi 8 and it's heading back to the way the Bondi 6 and 7 look and feel with a modern slightly softer mid sole. 

The first time I put the 9 on I was surprised by how light it feels on food and then I was more surprised when I found out it actually weighs slightly more than the 8. With the 8, I can definitely tell it's a heavy shoe because it's bottom heavy but not with the 9. Hoka did a great job balancing out the upper, midsole and outsole. The upper is now slightly wider in the mid foot area so that's a plus for me. With the 8, it was so narrow in the mid foot area that the medial side of my foot kept pressing against the firm midsole. Even though it didn't cause any blister or anything, it was uncomfortable to run in and it took a couple of miles to get used to that feeling. I'm so glad Hoka fixed that. Breathability is to be determined but it was 50 degrees when I ran this morning and I definitely felt some breeze as I was running.

The midsole is a much needed upgrade! It's definitely softer than the previous models but I do have to warn you that if you're expecting it to be something like the New Balance More v5, you're gonna be very disappointed. It's still a very cushioned shoe but slightly on the firmer side. There was one shoe that I kept thinking of as I was running in the 9 and it's the On Cloudeclipse. The run feels very similar between these two shoes: the midsole is very cushioned and you feel very protected but it also firms up a little and give you a little bounce back when you pick up the pace, the midsole definitely feels more alive at a faster pace (which is something I also notice in the Hoka Mach 6). The rocker also helps keep you in the rhythm and provides a much smoother ride. I thoroughly enjoy this improvement, and while I'm planning on using the 9 for easy and normal runs, I can definitely see myself running a few short speed sessions in it as well.

The outsole is again to be determined. No signs of wear and tear on my first run and if it's anything like the previous models, it should last you a long time.

Now for comparisons, all the shoes (except for the Bondi 8) in the picture are great cruisers so you can't really go wrong with any of them. That said, it really depends on your preference at this point. I will rank these shoes in different categories from ""least"" to ""most"" and again, these are just my opinions based on how my foot feels in these shoes so just take them with a grain of salt: 

- Softness:

On Cloudeclipse > Hoka Bondi 9 > Saucony Hurricane 24 = Brooks Glycerin Max > New Balance v5.

- Responsiveness:

New Balance v5 > Saucony Hurricane 24 > Brooks Glycerin Max = On Cloudeclipse > Hoka Bondi 9

- Versatility:

New Balance v5 > Saucony Hurricane 24 = Hoka Bondi 9 > On Cloudeclipse > Brooks Glycerin Max

- Value:

Brooks Glycerin Max > New Balance v5 > On Cloudeclipse > Hoka Bondi 9 = Saucony Hurricane 24 

Overall, I really appreciate what Hoka has done with this iteration of the Bondi and if you're a fan of the Bondi line, you should definitely give this a try.

Thank you for reading! If you have any questions, feel free to ask! I'll do my best to answer all of them.",2025-01-01 22:26:37+00:00,140,74

1hq7eys,PlantarFasciitis,90% healed after 2.5 years ,"Honestly never thought I‚Äôd say this (and kind of am afraid of jinxing it) but my plantar fasciitis is about 90% healed. For background, I (27F) have had PF for over two years and a few months ago was about to call my doctor to schedule surgery, as I felt it was my last resort. Sharing what I found has helped me so far, hoping it can help someone else.

I got PF a few months after I adopted an ACD mix. I was walking him a few miles a day after work, in shoes that were honestly a bit too worn out. I was also walking and commuting in a large city to an incredibly toxic job and having panic attacks every day, so I was not taking care of my body the way I should have. Then boom, PF that was stubborn and nothing was helping. 

Fast forward about 2 years and I went to Japan in March and cried every night because I was in so much pain and was so limited. I thought life as I knew it was over. I was making arrangements for my parents to watch my dog for at least 8 weeks so I could get the surgery. I was saving up PTO. Then, I made one last ditch effort to try everything, and things slowly started turning around. 

Things I tried that did not help me:
* icing my foot, rolling with a water bottle, etc (made me more stiff and the pain worse)
* custom prescription orthotics (if anything, made my pain worse) 
* Massage, tennis ball rolling, massage gun (made pain worse for several days)
* Tens unit therapy (did absolutely nothing for me)
* PF night splint (did not help my PF, but made my calf muscle incredibly tight  and gave me Achilles pain) 
* Calf stretching board (was not helpful to stretch calves alone)
* Foot strengthening exercises (towel rolling, marbles, etc‚Äî didn‚Äôt help)
* Taping, arch supports, toe spacers, etc (made no noticeable difference) 
* Weight bearing strengthening (squats, deadlifts, etc.)- made pain significantly worse for several days
* Oral steroids for ~2 weeks (did not help)

Probably missing some here. It feels like I tried everything, and everything felt hopeless. 

Things I didn‚Äôt try
* Cortisone shots (my Podatrist strongly suggested to not do this, was concerned about possible tendon damage and only masking the symptoms‚Äî I‚Äôve also had two cortisone shots for bunions before and I was okay with not reliving that very painful experience) 
* Surgery (I was making plans to have this done when things finally started turning around) 

My routine that has finally started to help me heal:
* Wearing supportive shoes 24/7. When I‚Äôm outside, I wear hoka bondis. Inside, I wear Oofoos slides. The only times when I‚Äôm on my feet and not wearing shoes are in the shower and during yoga. Other than that, always wearing shoes. Need to pee in the middle of the night? Gotta put on my slides before my feet even touch the ground. 
* Supportive socks, with targeted support/ compression. The feetures ankle socks have helped me a lot. 
* Consistently strengthening my legs and core, at minimum 2x per week. I joined a gym to use the weight machines to build strength without weight bearing on my foot. At least twice a week, I do 3-5 sets of 8-12 reps of the following: seated calf raise, hamstring curl, leg press, leg extension, hip abductor, hip adductor, and crunches. I had tried weight bearing strengthening exercises for months, but that just aggravated the problem.
* Yoga 2-3x a week. This was key for me. I joined my local yoga studio and attended 2-3 classes a week. At least one flow yoga and one yin yoga (poses held longer to release muscles and fascia). This really helped with calf and hamstring tightness, which I think has been the most beneficial. All those downward dogs, yogi squats, and forward folds really payed off.
* Hot bath 1-2 times a week. Really just as hot as i could stand it, I think this helped with increasing the blood flow and keeping things loose.
* Changing the way I stand and walk. I am a bit hyper mobile, so the way I stood (hyper extended knees, constantly shifting weight from one foot to another) was contributing to my problems. I have to consciously think about grounding my weight in both feet, and spreading my weight into all four corners of the feet. 
* Limiting the amount I walk/ progressive loading. At first I limited myself to under 3,000 steps a day. Slowly, I upped that. If I upped it enough to feel an increase in pain, I dropped that number back down until my flare up disappeared. Rinse and repeat. 
* Stopped sleeping with a weighted blanket. I believe that the weighted blanket was causing my ankle to over extend at night, which then made my calf muscle shorter, which contributed to my pain.
* Using lidocaine patches on feet and Advil when my pain was at its worst. occasionally an edible of things were really bad.

Unfortunately, after scrolling through this subreddit for hours upon hours, desperately looking for help, I know that everyone‚Äôs PF healing journey is different and their pain is caused by different things. I think mine was a combination of calf/hamstring tightness, weak core, poor standing posture, overuse, and poor/ worn out footwear. You really need to find what works for you. Keep a detailed log of everything you have tried, for how long, and how it impacts your pain. 

After 2.5 years of pain and about 5 months of being incredibly regimented and following all the things that brought me relief, I‚Äôd say my PF is 90% gone. My daily pain level went from a 7/10 (could barely walk) to an average 1.5/10 (with occasional flare ups when I do too much). For anyone out there suffering, who feels like they have tried everything, I see you, I feel you. Keep giving your body what it needs. Wishing us all healing in 2025.",2024-12-31 05:05:44+00:00,152,22
1hpn7io,runninglifestyle,Foot pain whilst running,"Hi all, my first post on reddit, not even sure i have posted in the right place. I'm 33 m 120kg I have recently started trying to get my fitness and weight back under control, playing football and recently started running.

When I run I get intense pain in my feet, the bottom outside middle of me feet, it starts after just a couple of hundred meters and intensifies, it's a really bad pain, it's like a bad cramping pain without the cramp, it makes me stop, only stopping and time seems to
sooth it. If I use a kerb to press my toes against to try and stretch my feet, it intensifies the pain. 
I'm pointing it towards my footwear, I have used some basic asics like these

https://www.sportsdirect.com/asics-jolt-4-mens
-running-shoes-212466 #colcode=21246603

And some more cushioned trainers like these

VdLn9lCY74AUBKRdmDGAgJpm20AKSf9csl
_hUOfKsRoCCnsQAvD_BwE

It's the same in football boots also and trainers like airmax 95 etc.

The thing steering me away from the shoes or
struggling to find a solution, up until 6 years ago I served in the British infantry for 10 years, during that time I'd ran 5,6 miles daily some times 8 miles with 44lbs on my back (which makes up for my weight gain since leaving) in anything I could get on my feet,
military boot, cheap trainers, borrowed used trainers that were multiple sizes to big and small, even did a 5k fun run in flip flops.

Although I have always suffered from back pain during long distance running (well over 5 miles) this is due to my posture I believe and a weak core, but this is almost like a cramping pain in my lower back, this is almost immediate these day aswell, but if I run leaning forward for a few seconds it gives me relief. 

But until I started again recently I have never had even a slight issue of foot pain whilst running. So that's my issue, I want to run to get fit and loose weight, but can't run more than 200m without pain so bad you just have to stop. Does anyone know where I can start to look to try and rectify this, iv googled and seen recommendations for different trainers.
Asics gel nimbus 26 
Some Hokas etc etc.
But ideally I don't want to be forking out 100s of ¬£s to just see if it works.

Not sure if there is any places I can go to get my feet looked and and get insoles etc.
I'm in the northwest of England, but don't mind travelling.

Again I'm reverting back to footwear issues but I'm not confident that's it. Any help would be very much appreciated, me and my 10 year old son have just started a couch to 10k
(he is mega fit, football 2 times a week, boxing 2 times a week) and I don't want to let him down by not being able to do it.
If this is in the wrong place please help me on where to post, like I say, first time posting on here so not sure where to put it.

Thank you all.

I started lifting last january pa, with occassional leg days, maybe once a week or in 2 weeks. and 3-4 upper body workout per week. my PR is about 70kg 3x8 sa squats pero not failure yan since kabado, walang spotter and kabado parin kahit may safety rails.

  
During the run, may times na sinusukuan ako ng utak ko kaya bigla napapa brisk walk nalang. need ko ba ng music dito for distractions? hahaha pero after ng run, i feel like my body can be pushed more. we walked to salcedo pa and around glorietta and greenbelt after. Kinabukasan, there is a slight discomfort around my right ankle, which was gone the day after. 

As a beginner, kahit papano nakapag research naman na me ng terms and some, but knowing na january 12 na agad yung run (nabudol kasi ako ng kasama eh hahaha), balik sa title. Kakayanin ba 16k by march if may enough training? medyo problemado rin since di ko pa maayos kung kelan isisingit jogging sa workout routine since 3 upper body then 1 legday.

50 years old, male.
Athletic build, weigh 235lbs.
Former bodybuilder.

Left foot has almost no arch, right foot has some.

I developed disabling PF perhaps 18 months ago. Nothing helped. Tried night splint, icing, stretching. The only thing that worked was to stop ALL weightlifting (squats, leg presses, calf-presses) and my daily walking.

Finally added custom hard orthotics from the VA, which digitally mapped my feet. 

It took 6 months for the PF to go away.

TODAY:

I began daily walking of 1 hour about a month ago. However, my feet are just now beginning to feel SLIGHTLY painful‚Äîdespite daily stretching. I continue to use my hard orthotics in a pair of Brooks shoes, that have a neutral and somewhat soft pad/insert.

THE QUESTION:

A few stores near me carry Hokas.

Can anyone reccommend a model of Hoka shoes which may be appropriate for daily walking as well as doing weight bearing exercises for my legs and calves?

1hm8bqn,RunningShoeGeeks, Novice Runner Review (AP3 > AP4) ,"https://preview.redd.it/b8wdpp8a129e1.jpg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5fec1e2b0584b798901f19a1ccd0876dc4d4ca2

TL:DR: I prefer the AP3, but many/most people will like the AP4.

Note: I‚Äôm a slow amateur runner. 5k times between 25-29 mins. This is my personal opinion and experience, not an objective, expert review.

**Soft**

* The AP4 is soft, too soft for me. It feels a lot like the Nike Vaporfly, but the forefoot of the AP4 sinks in more. I prefer the firmer feel of the AP3. It feels faster and more stable.
* The AP4 feels light on foot, but the softness makes it feel heavier/slower while jogging compared to the AP3.
* The soft forefoot while running causes my toes to go slightly numb. I had the same issue with the Mizuno Neo Vistas.

**Stability**

* The AP4s feel unstable to me. The AP3s are stable for me, even on the track. The forefoot flair on the AP4 is significant, but my foot sinks into the foam unevenly. It‚Äôs like the outside of the shoe is stable, but my foot is unstable inside the shoe. I suspect a more advanced athlete with better form will do fine in the AP4s.

**Upper**

* I can feel the heel collar on the AP4. It is slightly irritating with a hard plastic edge. The AP3 feels unnoticeable on my foot.
* Other than the heel, the uppers feel similar to me. I have zero issues with the AP3 upper and laces.

**Rocker**

* The AP4 has a lovely rocker feel. While walking, it feels similar to the Hoka Cielo x1. However, while running, the softness of the heel and forefoot makes me loose some of the rocker sensation.

**Loud**

* The bottom of the AP4 is squeaky on smooth surfaces and has some muted click noise when running. Drives me nuts. Not as loud as the infamous Nike Next% Tempos though.

**Size**

* Sizing is interesting. My toe looks to be in the exact same spot on both the AP3 and AP4 in size 7.5. But the AP4 feels shorter when jogging. It might be a size-up situation.

**AP4 Personal Use Cases**

* Walking
* Easy Jog
* Warm Up/Cool Down

Recently one of my friend mentioned that I have worn out shoes and shud have changed long time back. Visited specialised shoes store and they suggested Hoka. I don‚Äôt want to repeat same mistake about my shoe‚Äôs life going forward with newer ones and hurting myself again.

So was in search of an app that can records my distance and miles on shoes even when they are not recorded by smart watch, Such as walking while shopping or buying groceries. Found apps that can take data from activities by Apple Watch app but not the step count that is being recorded by iPhone continuously even when smart watch is not present.

We've never brought proper hiking shoes or boots with us but feel like our feet would benefit from doing so in the future.

Usually we go to warmer climates, for example our next trip will be to Madeira.

My girlfriend prefers the ankle support of a hiking boot. While I think I'd also like that the idea of a lighter shoe appeals to me as well as we'd take them in our luggage on flights etc.

So far I have looked at Lowa renegade GTX for my girlfriend as she likes the look of them. I also took a look at Salomons X ultra 4 but I've been reading some things about poor quality lately.

What would be some other good recommendations? Would trail runners like hoka speedgoat 6 be a good option as well?

Thanks!",2024-12-24 11:20:10+00:00,4,19
1hl5ye2,PHRunners,"Mom of the year.. (Appreciation and inspirational post update)
","I didn't think my [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PHRunners/comments/1hkgwlw/mom_of_the_year_hays/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) will go big and relate with so many people. I appreciate everyone's compassion and kindness towards me. I'm also thankful for the people who express their admiration and congratulations as well. I just wanna use this post to inspire and be grateful to all of you. I also wanna tell the story of how and why I did the marathon and also the story of me and my mother. I'll try to make the story short.

TLDR AT THE END

before hand, to all the people thinking this is fake. No, this are a real life experience of mine and my relationship towards my mother.

First of all, I appreciate everyone who is expressing their emotions as same as mine towards my mother but please show respect to her. She is still my mother at the end of the day and even she is an emotionally immature parent, she is also a human being experiencing life for the first time. I don't share my mother everything that's happening to me even my future. Like I said since I was a child I have learned to keep everything of what I did to myself because no one will be there for me to share my vulnerability. I'm emotionally cut off to her and I can live my life as I wanted. I've only shared the Marathon achievement to her because it's been a long time since I've shared anything to her. I knew she wouldn't care but I still did because at least she deserves to know her child achieve this kinds of things. at the end, we all know it's futile.

If you wanna know my reaction towards it, I didn't reply. I just went to the shower and cried myself to feel. I held myself to comfort and give compassion to myself. It was my inner child crying. It's a good reminder to myself. that I'm secure and I'm capable of my own without them or everyone. I don't long for my parent's approval but it hurts sometimes to be reminded that the people who should be closest to you feels the farthest the most.

Now the marathon. I'll tell you why and how I did the marathon.

I was heartbroken at that time. It was a 5 year relationship. My ex left me for another man. I don't have any vices so I don't have anything to use to cope with the pain of grieving. I was psychologically injured, have insomnia, low appetite, experiencing extreme chest pain, self doubting, in despair, and everything you can think off experiencing of losing someone you've loved. I need something to survive that phase because I attempted >!suicide!< once. I thought it was the only way because I had no one to hold on to or give me compassion and care. I couldn't sleep, so I thought I should run everyday so I can be tired and sleep properly. I ran 10km everyday. No proper training and all. I just ran 10 km everyday. Even though I did that and took some sleeping pills to sleep. I still couldn't sleep properly. So I started running to cope with pain of grieving.

Days have passed and my best friend texted me to check up me. I told him I'm using the running as my coping mechanism for the pain. Then he told me that there's this marathon coming up and we should sign up. He started running recently at that time as well as me but separately. We signed up late because the marathon is only a week after that day. So I just kept running to cope with the pain until then.

The day of the 16km Hoka trilogy run. At the start, I feel like I was a kid again. For a moment, I forgot everything even the extreme chest pain I was experiencing that time. We just kept running and having fun together. We didn't think about how fast we finished but we indulge ourselves at the moment. We just feeling the presence of being there. Running with everyone. The people along side you is doing the same challenge as you. The mental and physical battle you get from running that long. The feeling like you aren't alone. That day gave me all the compassion and comfort I need. That day gave me the clarity and wisdom of what happened to me. I will never forget that day sensing the feeling of being free from the past.

We finished the run in 2 hours for our first try as newbies. I got teary at the finish line because I was happy again for myself. Even if it's just for a small amount of time. We took pictures and get our stuff but during that time we've been wondering why the shape of the medal looks weird. Someone told us that the medal is just one piece of the whole medal. We need to finish the full trilogy to complete the whole medal. Me and my best friend just looked at each other and knew we have to finish now the whole thing. That's how it started. We just kept running to train for the whole thing.

Now for the people asking me how I trained for the whole trilogy and the full marathon. I just kept adding mileage to my run. Means I just keep running every other day for 10 km or 1 hour minimum. My advice is nothing will help you be prepared with the mental and emotional battle you'll be facing during the full marathon. It's really about how strong is your mentality than your physical endurance. I cried and collapsed at the finish line when I finished the full marathon because I never thought I would make it and cause of heat exhaustion from my legs. I finished it in 7 hours. One hour left until cut off. I collapsed because at the half of the marathon my whole leg began cramping. Means I have to run 21 km more and on a bridge 4 times to finish. So I was physically injured during half of the run. The mental and emotional battle during those times is one of the experience I'll never forget because I remember almost crying every time my legs began cramping and feeling the pain. I just told myself the quote ""never give up, never surrender"". Also the thought of wanting to get into every ambulance I saw to quit and heal my legs is so hard to refuse but I still keep going because I promised myself I'll do everything to finish the race because if I can give my everything to someone, I can give the same amount to myself.

I've dealt with some of the worst experience you can imagine towards a child and this is small (the mom of the year screenshot) compared to the past but I've learned the wisdom from it. That's why I'm sharing this to spread kindness and inspiration to everyone who is losing hope.

I've shared you guys some of my struggles which is experiencing extreme grieving from a heartbreak, an emotionally immature abusive parent, and the mental and physical challenge of the full marathon trilogy. Now I want to share you guys the outcome of those things. I'm now happy and free from the past, more emotionally mature towards any relationships, more physically active and healthy. I have been reading books that gives me wisdom towards healing and introspection. How to be more emotionally mature towards everything and how to heal myself from the past to be happy for oneself. I'm now an official pacer of running communities and events. I've helped and spread communities happiness and a fun way to be healthy. Also a MARATHONER and an AMMATURE BOXER hehe.

I have never been this happy and free for myself and I want to share this experience of mine to be an inspiration to everyone. I hope everyone to have this holistic and humbled lifestyle. Just keep working on your self. Emotionally, Physically, and Financially.

Merry Christmas to everyone and have a happy and healthy New Year.

I'll be forever grateful for everyone who commented and msgs me to show their kindness and compassion. I hope ya'll kind gestures towards me brought back to everyone ten folds. Thank you.

TLDR: I'm happy and grateful with my life. I'm not being controlled with the past and my parents. I've survive an extreme experience of grieving a heartbreak. More emotionally, physically, and financially mature. Became a Marathoner, Pacer, Physical Trainer Enthusiast, and an Amateur Boxer. Still continuing to heal my inner child and past wounds.

1hkx3zj,PlantarFasciitis,PF and Weightlifting ,"Hello! 

I wanted to ask others with PF and not a generic fitness thread about the whole ""flat"" shoes and weightlifting. 

I don't understand how people feel unbalanced in shoes other than flat foot and the issue for me is that if I were to wear shoes other than those for PF, I would literally become immobilized. 
I am not joking or being hyperbolic. Before I got proper shoes, the pain would be so bad I couldn't stand and I'd fall over frequently. Now I am doing great. 

I want to get into weight lifting but not at the cost of injuries. Insoles do not work and have not in the past, so that's not exactly an option and I don't know how to get through to a trainer that I can't just ""tough it out for the booty"" (his words, not mine.)

TLDR: Can I wear my Hokas for weightlifting? I need to wear them to avoid injuries from PF. 

Any ideas? 

Update: 
Thank you for the input! Yall are great, thank you! My other question is why? I do a lot of manual labor lifting and haven't experienced any issues there, so I am curious. ",2024-12-23 20:51:41+00:00,2,11

1hkiqm7,trailrunning,Next pair of shoes ,"I‚Äôm nearing the end of my lifespan on my current trail running shoes, saucony xodus ultra 3. This was my first real running shoe I ever bought and I have really loved it. Super comfortable, great traction, really felt like they were putting a spring in my step when they were new. Any recommendations on which pair to get next? Looking for something similar to these. When I bought this pair I went and tried on several pairs of hokas and found them to feel a lot more stuff and rigid compared to the sauconys. I believe I tried a couple of the speed goats. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs other good models from hoka that was just my initial thoughts. Also tried a few pairs of brooks and they weren‚Äôt bad, just weren‚Äôt good enough to win me over.

1hjz29o,RunningShoeGeeks,"Review and Thoughts - Adidas Pro Evo SL & Adidas Adios Pro 4 after 50km (31 miles) each! Comparisons with Other Super Shoes Included
","https://preview.redd.it/l9y2a1kspe8e1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bb49ba552cfd16a995ae115a92dab38cbd07d388

Currently sidelined from my marathon training for a week due to the common cold, so I thought I'd use up some of the free time away from running to write about these two shoes that I picked up in November and this month. I live in Asia, where Adidas has released these shoes, albeit in limited quantities and colourways.

Hopefully, this post helps to maybe make choices a bit easier.

Some background about me first: M, Late 20s, 161-162cm, typically hovers between 58 - 61 kg and my PRs are 1:35 half-marathon (hot climate) and 3:24 (cooler climate). Running for about close to 4 years. Typically high cadence of >190 & mid-foot/forefoot striker.

Shoe sizes I typically wear:

Adidas: US 9 (AP4, AP3), except for Prime X Strung (PXS) 1 & 2 US 8.5

Asics: US 9 (Novablast), except for SuperBlast (SB) 1 & 2 US 8.5

Hoka: US 9 (Cielo X1)

Nike: US 9 (Alphafly 3, Vaporfly 3)

New Balance: US 9 (SC Elite V4)

I'll start this post by talking about the shoes individually, and then combine them at the end with my overall thoughts for marathon training. I have more comments on the AP4 vs the Evo SL, but if you have any thoughts on either shoe, let me know?

**Adidas Evo SL**

**Fit:** TTS (US 9) for me. There's enough space overall and the fit isn't too snug nor too roomy. I think it's okay and decent. I don't have much to say because generally I'll know if a shoe is snug (my PXS1+2 is) but, this feels fine. No slippage or anything.

**Upper:** Same as the one in the EVO 1. Didn't touch the shoe but to me this felt just like standard smooth upper I've come to expect from Adidas. Only this time, no dreaded blistering (I faced this in the AP3, I'll write about it later). Breathable and nice. No further comments.

**Bottom Sole:** Continental Outsole for most parts with the standard Adidas rubber. Got nothing more to say - looked good after 30km (18.6 miles) and 20km (12.4 miles) each (I have 2 shoes). Doesn't seem to have any signifcant wear and tear.

(Added in after comment) Foam: Same LSP formulation as the Adios Pro 3, but bouncy.

**Workouts & Ride Impressions:** Did Runs ranging between 5 - 14km (3.1 - 8.7 miles) so far. All I can say is - wow, this shoe wants you to be quick! Slotting into the shoe, I realize it feels more ground-like as opposed to the shoes I've typically worn in (see above), but that didn't stop me from being quick or made it feel awkward at all! I am typically hitting tempo paces with these shoes easily, and it feels effortless.

I did try to do an easy run with this shoe - it felt great, but man, I had to hold it back to not make it a dash. I generally run by feel, but in this shoe, I always hit my Tempo and even above my MP paces towards the end! The foam is bouncy but yet firm. I had no issues with this shoe in wet weather, with the Continental outsole. You'll feel the ground feel yet the energy return is superb. Makes you want to go fast.

**Overall thoughts & comparisons:** Excellent for Tempo & Fast Workouts; easy runs can be done too! This is an excellent training companion overall!

I can see myself taking this shoe up to the half-marathon without any issues. This shoe can probably do easy runs, but my easy runs are currently being handled by the Superblast 2 and the Novablast 5, so I think I'll alternate this shoe and the Superblast 2 frequently. I do feel that this IS the Superblast 2 replacement for those who can't get it, despite the low significantto ground feel. I know many people take the SB1+2 for long runs, but I do my long runs in the PXS2 now.

Do you have to rush to Adidas to buy this shoe? I guess... not really? The SB1 & 2 works wonders but Adidas finally introduced something that's way comparable to the shoe and I'm no longer restricted to the SBs for these types of workouts anymore. But I would wholeheartedly buy more of these once my current pairs wear out. I really can't see any other shoe beside the SB fitting in the comparisons. Maybe the Novablast 4-5? But the Novablast is in its own category, I don't think there's any comparison.

**Adidas Adizero Pro 4**

I've written a more detailed review of this shoe as I was typing this out when I first got it after a few runs, but I waited for the EVO SL before deciding to combine it together.

Fit: True to Size. US 9, UK 8.5. They fit normally to me - I had no issue with the toe box space, it is just nice. Not too broad, not too narrow either.

Upper: Pro 3 users who suffered due to the upper, REJOICE! They've finally addressed this with an entirely brand new upper that is now a soft-like cloth(?) material. When I first touched it, I went ""OH WOW"". After my run - there was no blistering or sign that it was causing any friction on any part of my foot unlike the Pro 3! I felt so overjoyed with this upper, considering how the Pro 3 was my favorite marathon racer but I had to stop wearing it due to how afraid I am with the upper causing blisters.

I do believe some people will question its breathability, but I am currently training in a constantly hot & humid country, so this isn't a huge concern as my feet will adapt to it. Overall, the upper is amazing and fits very nicely and gently. Kind of like a sock-like texture. I had no issues with the laces or anything, they were good! The upper held up during my run, and there was no immediate sign of wear & tear despite it being cloth-like. The shoe and my feet were wet after the run, but this is more of a training location issue versus the shoe flaw. I think it's fine; breathability isn't an issue.

Bottom Sole: Continental rubber is now reduced to just a small portion of the shoe (where you're expected to strike at the forefoot), and the other part of the sole of the shoe is fitted with LIGHTRAXION. I had no issues with grip and easily navigated sharp turns with the shoe; this new sole material feels nice, grippy and good. Unfortunately, I have not (and will not want to, for now) tried this on wet surfaces, so I can't say much. But I think it'll hold just fine. Overall, no grip issues, feels like a Pro 3 grip.

Foam: This is not the Lightstrike Pro on the Pro 3. I can confirm. It is MUCH softer than the Pro 3, and even the Prime X Strung 2, which is my marathon trainer/cruiser.  (Edited) I can also confirm this is NOT the same foam as the EVO SL as the Pro 4 uses a different formulation of LSP whereas the Pro 4 has a new formulation.

During my trial runs, I found the foam to be more bouncy than the EVO SL & the Pro 3 and the energy return felt slightly more than the Pro 3, but not fully bouncy like the ZoomX + Air pods Combination of the Alphafly 3 or Hoka's Cielo X1. It does feel close to the ZoomX of the VF3. I would somehow categorize this as a taller VF3.

**The Runs: 2x Half-Marathon**

**First:** Medium-Long Half-Marathon 21.1km (13.1 miles) as part of a Pfitzinger Marathon Training Block - I was in the first week of the Taper Block. The first 2km (1.2 miles) felt so amazing, that I wasn't sure if it was the shoe or a new shoe placebo. I felt I was starting too fast, and I toned down slightly between 3-4km (1.8 - 2.5 miles) to control my Heart Rate (it was high, plus I was pretty nervous as these were my only pair and I was scared to damage the shoe). But after that, I kept a cool constant pace of an average of 4:55/km (7:55/mi) for the next 10km (6.2 miles) before speeding up from 16km (10 miles) to the very end at 4:42/km (7:34/mi). The overall pace for the half was 4:50/km (7:46/mi). I achieved a 1:42 half-marathon, but this was a medium-effort workout for me (due to my rather careless dash at the start), but in line with my efforts should I be racing.

**Second:** Another half-marathon, this time a ""race""  I took part 2 weeks after my full marathon that I achieved the 3:24 marathon time. Because this was a super crowded & congested race, I started out very conservatively at 5:00/km - 5:10/km (8:03/mi - 8:19/mi) before ramping up to sub 4:45/km (7:38/mi) for the final 10km (6.2 miles) and even a 4:03/km (6:31/mi) dash at the last km of the race. Energy returns felt amazing! The shoe was bouncy and energetic throughout, to the point where even my last km where I sprinted it still felt like the shoe wanted more!

**Overall Thoughts: I**t's an excellent shoe! The shoe rewards you if you are forefoot striking, but I am sure that heelstrikers won't be neglected either. I just didn't land on my heel too much to ascertain if heel striking would cause anything, so I apologize to the Redditors who are curious about heel striking - I can't give you many comments. The shoe has the 3 carbon rods similar to the Pro 3, so the geometry/curvature of the shoe didn't change much, which means you should expect the ride to be about the same.

I do believe slower paces will find this shoe good as well, but some may be concerned if the slightly softer LSP might be a detriment as compared to the firmer LSP found on the Adios Pro 3. The shoe is an awesome cruiser that keeps paces stable.

I feel like this is a great shoe from the 5k to the marathon for all paces. I also felt like Adidas polished this shoe very very well, especially the upper. I like this shoe and would want to reach for it more. If you love the Pro 3, you'll be happy to know that Adidas didn't change the shoe much, and this will be a good upgrade. However, I am very sure some may not like the softer LSP and prefer a firmer ride. If you're in that group, maybe go and snag as many Pro 3s on sale, but this is not my recommendation; it's just a preference for me. But overall, the ride and ""higher"" feeling of the Pro 3 still carries over to the Pro 4, and if you like that, this is a very good shoe.

**Comparisons**

Nike Alphafly 3: I think this is one of the shoes against the Pro 4. I love the Alphafly 3. The carbon plate is much more aggressive and curved as compared to the Adios Pro 4. I also find the ZoomX + Air Pods combination to give excellent energy return. I do my long runs in this shoe (>26km / >16.2 miles) and always find them to be an amazing cruiser that can sustain efforts, and oddly, I spend less effort on them versus any other shoe, even against the Pro 4. But the Pro 4 is equally amazing with the cruising ride, and I do suspect that the Pro 4 will work the calves less than the Alphafly. I like both shoes and both would work extremely well for the marathon. I've ran my marathon in the AP3 and did manage to PR, but after running my 2 runs with the Adios Pro 4, I'm tilting towards the Adios Pro 4 now. I'm going to get some more long runs to try and see which will be my next racer for my marathon. I really can't decide. I also note the horrible wear longetivity of the Alphafly 3  - whereas my AP4 did not have any issues with wear and tear after 2 half-marathons.

Nike Vaporfly 3: I think this is the closest Nike Shoe with ZoomX foam that the Adios Pro 4 is. In short? The AP4 is a taller feeling VF3. I like the higher stack, so I'll pick the AP4.

Hoka Cielo X1: This is currently my favourite racer up to the half-marathon distance, but will now be dethroned by the Adios Pro 4. I love aggressive front-shaped carbon plates, and the Cielo X1 provides that. However, I'm starting to not like how I feel about the slightly close-to-ground feel at the forefoot of the X1s, but this is nitpicking. I like higher-feeling shoes, and the Pro 4 is much higher. If you like to propel yourself forward, I think the Cielo X1 suits better. But if you want some control, maybe the Adios Pro 4 is better. I like both shoes, but if I had to pick one, it would be the Adios Pro 4, mainly due to weight & height. I won't find an issue picking either for a fast race day up to a half, but I'll try the Adios Pro 4 for now. Both are good shoes, either way.

New Balance SC Elite V4: This was my planned Marathon Racer before the Alphafly 3 came into my possession. The plate is less aggressive than the Alphafly 3, but between this and the Adios Pro 4, I think the rolling efforts are much easier on the Adios Pro 4. The SC Elite V4 is slightly heavier as well. Some days with the SC Elite V4 felt dull - I wanted something faster. I think the AP4 can go faster for sure. Overall, like the VF3, I'll pick the AP4 due to how much taller the stack it feels lets me roll faster.

Adidas Adios Pro 3: I did mention the AP3 a few times in my review, but GOODBYE Horrendous upper, but slightly softer LSP. Same Carbon rod system. AP3 has a firmer LDP. Softer LSP for the AP4. Aggressive? AP4 (by a bit). Cruiser? Both. Overall for me? AP4.

**Marathon Traning Summary**

So in short, my marathon rotations will be as follows:

Easy Runs: Adidas Adios Evo SL / Asics Superblast 2

Tempo Workouts: Adidas Adios Evo SL / Asics Superblast 2 / Adidas Prime X Strung 2 (Longer Tempos)

MP Workouts: Adidas Adizero Pro 4 / Adidas Prime X Strung 2 / Nike Alphafly 3

Race Day:

Half: Pro 4 hands down

Marathon: EITHER Pro 4 or Alphafly 3 (still deciding!!), need to do more runs!

The Prime X Strung 2 remain my favourite long-run shoe, and will continue to be a training supplemement

Overall, both shoes feel amazing and if you can pick them up, go ahead! But trust me - the running shoe market is saturated so much that there are always other brands that produce good shoes too. I just like these for my ride and feels. Your mileage may vary, so don't buy into the hype until you try!",2024-12-22 14:02:38+00:00,137,54

1hj23pn,PlantarFasciitis,in need of better shoe recommendations,"Hello! i‚Äôm posting here in hopes of getting some shoe recommendations that fit more into my style. I got diagnosed with plantar fasciitis in my right foot a few months ago and have been getting steroid shots. I‚Äôm on my last shot before my dr. recommends physical therapy as the next step. I know all the common shoe recommendations and have purchased and used brooks, oofos, etc. And they‚Äôre great but they do not fit my style at all. tbh i feel like most of the orthopedic/ podiatrist approved shoes are very ugly or clownish (hokas). I prefer a more alternative style so i would love some recommendations of footwear that fit that category. I love platform boots, my fav is my dr marten jadon maxx but they‚Äôre really difficult to wear now a days. I really don‚Äôt want to give up that part of my style so I would love some recs.

1hio5w0,RunningShoeGeeks,Review for Saucony Ride 17s (Comparisons to Ride 16s and also Wave Riders in general),"Longtime lurker. I feel like I have a fairly unique experience with running and dealing with injuries, so perhaps my reviews could come in handy for people dealing with persisting issues and also refusing to succumb to the hardships of being ""middle-aged.""

I'm about 190lbs. Mid-to-toe striker. 40yrs, male. Mile sub 6, half-marathon pace is about 7:30 or so. Never saw a point to run longer than that. I'm not a cadence runner but it's usually around 175-180 or so unless I'm on that final mile.

Readers digest version is that I had a calcaneal heel spur removed over two years ago (achilles was about to explode). Constantly overdid it during lockdown. Run. Stretch. Deal with pain for the rest of the day. Repeat. I'm over 600 days post-op. Still deal with tendonitis. Also dealing with an ankle sprain from a BMX accident in other ankle. Dorsiflection is almost back to normal. Go me.

I realize the purpose of running shoes isn't to mitigate pain, so this review isn't about that. I'm just a runner who deals with it, and running actually helps strengthen these injured areas. Meaning, the shoes I wear play an important role in wanting to enjoy my own personal version of pain therapy. However, because of my weight -- not trying to lose any -- and my injuries, I do not go more than 250 miles in a pair of running shoes. 

The weird jump from the 16 to the 17 is kind of perplexing. I'd say that the Rides, in general, are kind of stiff at first. A friend swore by them -- which is what initially prompted me to try them out -- and after about 50 or so miles I fell in love with the 16s. Best all-day trainers I've ever worn. Great for slow miles. And easy to run sub-7 min splits in a 5k or 10k race in them also. 

I was a Mizuno Wave Rider guy before trying the Rides. Those are fantastic right out of the box, but I usually start to feel impact of my runs at around 180-200 miles. With the Rides, your feet can really wrap around the terrain like a glove without having to deal with the impact. When I say terrain, I mean road or hard dirt, but I live in New Orleans, so running on pavement is a bit like... uhhhh... off-roading. With the Rides, I can easily take them to 250 miles (both 16 and 17). At that point, I make myself buy a new pair. I cannot take any more risks.

Now the the main point. The 17s are bulkier for no reason. I feel like Saucony changed a perfectly perfect thing, and it feels like they're already trying to marry a few of these styles together given the lack of selection from their current website. I'd never buy a pair of 17s again, and would in fact rather search for the 16s on Amazon or something. 

The upper is fine. I don't really care about the uppers that much in general, though, as the weight of shoes doesn't bother me a whole lot. My legs are strong. The soles are just starting to approach Hoka territory, and I hate that brand. Part of that is perhaps due to ankle-danger with these potholes here, but I do not think huge puffin soles equate to a softer, pain-free run. 

The 17s are like the 16s before they get broken in. But then, they never do. Maybe they're not meant for people my size, or rather, people my size who can still run at a decent speed. It's a shame, because the colorways are pretty dope for the 17s, as opposed to the horrid colors of most of the 15s and 16s. 

I ordered some Asics Novablast 5s and will probably review those next. As this is my first review here, I'll leave you with the post-surgery rankings of what I've worn once I could comfortably run 8-10 miles at a sub-8 pace:

Saucony Ride 16 - 10/10 The perfect all-day trainer

Saucony Speed 4 - 9/10 Great for race days but I barely got 150 miles out of them. I'd rather take a stab at their carbon plate option if the thing isn't going to last that long anyway

Mizuno Wave Rider 26 - 8.5/10 Really great all-day trainer. Not as much longevity as the Rides, and don't allow for as much ""oneness"" between the foot and the concrete

Saucony Ride 17s - 7.5/10 A great, long-lasting shoe that is a bit too bulky and stiff.

1hhtsi1,bunions,cyst on outer foot?,"Ever since I had lapiplasty aon my right foot last year, I've had a horrible time finding supportive shoes which fit both that foot and my other foot, which had a more traditional rip-open procedure 7 years ago.  I've also developed a cyst/callus of some sort on the outer part of my right foot, around the area where the midfoot/arch meets the heel.  It's blistered and burst a number of times.  It hurts like hell, especially while wearing any kind of firm footwear.

I know there's such things as a Jones fracture on the 5th metatarsal as well as a type of misalignment due to the corrected alignment of the first (and in my case, also the second) metatarsal.  I don't think I have a fracture but then again IANAD.

My shoe issue is that wide widths are too wide and regular widths are too narrow.  Hokas, for example, fit fine in the upper area but their shape from the arch to the heel is too narrow -- my midfoot splays over the sole.  Ditto for other makes -- Brooks, Alegria, New Balance, etc.  This is rather distressing because I work in hospitality and am required to wear specific nonslip shoes.

1hhj47n,walking,Hokas vs Kiziks: More isn't necessarily better,"61 year old obese woman with ankle and knee issues.  

Before I lost about 100 pounds, it was *really* (embarrassingly) difficult to get shoes on -- thus the appeal of Kiziks where you could just step into them.  They have been my goto shoe since the pandemic even after I lost the weight.

However, as I wanted to start walking again after losing weight, my sisters recommended Hokas.  I started walking about 2-3 weeks ago and was using my Hokas for walking but Kiziks for ""out and about"".  

During the first 2 weeks of trying to get my walks in, I was having problems with my knee and ankle while wearing the Hokas.  Figured it was just asking more of my joints than I had in years (decades?).  

Yesterday, without realizing it, I just started walking while wearing my Kiziks -- didn't realize until I was about 1/2 way through the walk.  I wound up with my best pace and time/distance since I started walking again.  Absolutely no ankle pain.  Tonight, I went ahead and wore the Kiziks and even though it was a shorter walk (25 minutes vs 35 minutes), still no pain.

Am I getting stronger or are the Kiziks just a better ""fit"" for my stiffness?  If I'm feeling ok, any downside with continuing with the Kiziks vs the much more expensive and supposedly better quality Hokas?

Thanks in advance!",2024-12-19 02:55:58+00:00,5,7

1. Heat them up. Use a hairdryer, put them in a sealed bag to keep them dry and then put that in warm/hot (but not boiling) water

1hgdidy,Marathon_Training,Trust the process,"TLDR: 
Half-marathon journey: 
1:55:53 (5/2022) ‚è© 2:02:29 (3/2024) ‚è© 1:48:45 (12/2024)

40/M, 160lbs, Marathon 4:20:14 (2022),  began racing in 2022, took 2023 off and started again in 2024.

Over the past few months, training for this half marathon served as a stepping stone toward redeeming my marathon performance next year. I committed to running my slow runs as intended- something that felt counterintuitive at first. It didn‚Äôt feel like I was getting faster, but running is as much of a mental game as it is a physical. Trusting the process isn‚Äôt easy, but consistency pays off.

I questioned my training a lot, especially with rolling hills in my training environment. Run by HR zones or effort? Incorporate strength training or risk burning out my legs? Hop on the treadmill or hit the pavement?

I choose effort-based training and skipped strength sessions to preserve my legs. I stuck to hitting the pavement even on cold days and hit the treadmill on rainy days.

As for the race, I got a few surprises.
‚ñ™Ô∏èelevation changes ‚úÖ
‚ñ™Ô∏ètrails involved ‚úÖ
‚ñ™Ô∏ènarrow running paths ‚úÖ (5 runners wide at best) 
‚ñ™Ô∏ècolder than expected with 31¬∞ F at the start of the race

I felt physically and mentally prepared for the rolling hills but I would have liked to know where in the course the big elevation changes were to more efficiently use my energy. The trails made me question stability at first, but felt my Hoka Mach X2s were good enough. The narrow paths were annoying especially when passing people so ‚Äúoff roading‚Äù it was when passing. As for the weather, I knew it was going to be cold but not that cold. A last minute purchase of a running vest and gloves saved me. The experience in this running gear and environment would be very different than my previous two half marathons and would be a first cold ü•∂ weather run for me.

On race day, I started faster than planned but trusted how I felt. Positive mantras replaced doubt, and I kept checking in with effort. Splits rolled in, and I couldn‚Äôt believe it- I felt strong, smooth and unstoppable. Crossing the line 7 minutes faster than my fastest PR showed me what‚Äôs possible when you train smart, trust the work, and keep showing up. 

Plugging this new PR into race predictors has me set for a sub-4 marathon next year. Missing my goal last year by 10 minutes, I feel redemption is within reach.

Key takeaways:
üëâ trust the process
üëâ know the course, your strengths and weaknesses
üëâ train the mind as much as the body",2024-12-17 15:48:24+00:00,10,2

1hdqgzt,RunningShoeGeeks,My thoughts on the Asics Superblast 2 after 65 miles (100km). ,"31M, 5'6, 140lbs, Size 9. 1:32 HM 

I've now run in this shoe for 65 miles. Just finished a 1:35 half marathon effort in them this morning. Already have the Hoka Mach 6 and Cielo X1 but wanted something else for long run efforts as the Mach felt a little flat after 10+ miles. I bought into the hype of the Asics Superblast 2, hoping it would be the answer, but I‚Äôve been a little disappointed. 

The shoe felt stiff and slappy out of the box, reminiscent of the Alphafly sound (not as bad though). While they softened slightly after about 20 miles, they remain slappy and offer an abrupt transition that doesn‚Äôt encourage a smooth roll through the stride. I feel more comfortable landing midfoot, but the shoe seems to want adjustments to my natural stride (slight heel strike), making me very aware of it on my feet.

Lockdown has been the biggest challenge, especially on my right foot, where I get heel lift unless I use a runner‚Äôs knot. However, the knot causes soreness across the top of my ankle‚Äîsomething I haven‚Äôt experienced to this degree with other shoes with a runner's knot‚Äîand creates hot spots on the medial side of my feet during longer runs. Even then, I have had to stop and retie at some point every run to try and fix the fit without much improvement. 

On the positive side, the black colorway looks great (not that important), and the toebox width and upper are generally comfortable, aside from the lockdown issues. Wet grip is also pretty good with a long run in heavy rain and leaves on the pavement. I‚Äôve tested them across various paces‚Äîfrom easier 10-minute miles to sub-6-minute tempos‚Äîand found they perform best at faster paces but feel underwhelming at slower ones, even 8 min paces. 

Compared to the Hoka Mach 6, with the early meta stage rocker, these just don‚Äôt deliver the same smooth ride and rebound for me. I‚Äôm considering selling them and switching to my Hoka Cielo X1 for longer runs (adore that shoe). Perhaps the Superblast 2 is better suited for heavier runners, as I might simply be too light to get the most out of them.

Anyone else feel this way or know how to address the lockdown issues? I'm just not feeling the ""shoe of the year"" that so many others are. ",2024-12-14 00:21:40+00:00,58,109

One day the pain wasn‚Äôt there, and if I had to think back upon what changed, I‚Äôd attribute it to:
1. Really cheap insoles on Amazon - they hurt like hell when I first put them inside my Hoka Clifton (threw out the Hola insoles) but after a few days, I could walk bare feet in the house even! Here‚Äôs the link: https://a.co/d/5echjZ5
2. Self-massage on the legs whenever possible
3. The only other things that I had changed was focusing on inflammation management diet. Started taking probiotics, avoiding sugar.

That‚Äôs it - no exercise other than just walking. At some point I started to feel that I might have been misdiagnosed with PF when the issue might have been related to nerve entrapment. I still think this might be the likely case. 
I don‚Äôt know if any of this will help anyone, but I sure hope it does. ",2024-12-13 18:08:59+00:00,10,2

I don't want to minimize anyone who is suffering from a severe case, but my plantar fasciitis got bad enough that I had to completely stop walking and exercising. Maybe up to an 8 on the pain scale especially in the mornings.

I had to just rest, no choice. I didn't do much activity for six months, but in that time, it got better.

The next thing I did was use the Hoka recovery slides  whenever I was at home. I stopped using my house slippers, flip flops, etc., and spent the majority of the day in my recovery slides. I started using plush stability sneakers also from Hoka when I resumed activity. 

I feel using well supported and cushioned shoes really helped as well as the rest.

 I have been almsot pain free for like a week now, I will tell you what I have done and maybe it works for you


my pain was at the begning on the arch, like very very sore and ripping pain, then it progresed to behind the ankle on both sides going upward specially if I walked, on the mronign the fot felt sore and extremly stiff to the painful level of stifness

extemly flat feet, hypermobile, fit atheletic 180cm 75kg, go to the gym usually for many years bodybuilding lifting weights
In order of what i tried more or less



* started with stretches (did nothing)

* ice, ball rolling, towel pulling (did nothing)

* new orthotics (did nothing)

* diathermy (did nothing)

* bough ofos slippers (relieved soemthing)

* 2 cortisone injections (did relive the pain like from 10/10 to 7/10)

* tried 3 PT that didnt help

around this time I started having also pain behind my ankle where the bone and shooting up towards the knee on both sides

I consulted a top doctor of medicine sports that recomended at elast 1 year of PT with strenght and stability exercies

* strengh exercise for the feet (around 1 year doing different exercies decres from 8-6 to 7-3 depending on the day)

* orthotics revised by another person (didnt do much)

* wearing hoka arahi (reduced the pain from 7 to 5)

* wearing hoka bondi (actually increased the pain a bit specially the ankle pain)

* bought pistol massage gun (relieved pain at home but dont think did a lot)

* bought red light (did nothing)

* bought barefoot shoes (was too painful to walk in, so ditched them)

* shockwave therapy done by a PT like 5 sesions with diathermy before (decres from 8-7 on bad days to 7-6, or maybe nothing)

* bough toe spacers (did nothing)

* bought night splint and strasbuss sock and wore for like a motnth each (the strasbus sock actually increased the pain, the splint did nothing)

* strenght exercise like ratlclef protcol but trying with a lot of weigh, like 30kg or so at eh gym (more weigh less reps 312, 38, 48, 46 and repeat with more weight at the begning), tibialis and soleus exercises with elastic bands, very heavy bands 2-4 series 10-15 reps progresing each week, short foot while pressing hard with the big toe, isometric hold( 45 s 3-4 series) (all that took the pain from 7 to 4-6 depending on the day)

* shockwave therapy 3 sesion of 5 min (the one that is pulsed inside the muscle not the one that is like massage gun) (maybe 0.5 less pain?)

* new expensive orthotics (did almost nothing)

I was finally called for public health care  doctor and told me only solution was surgery

now, desperate, this hass been almsot 3 years. I consulted a new PT specialied in chronic pain

He recomended wearing no orthotics at all when coming back from work and at the gym

doing 3 days a week pylometirc work (so jumps, box jump, jump over a dumbell with one foot, cleans (from clean and jerk) onto a box with one foot, and some others 2-3 series 1 min max intensity).

This since 3 weeks ago I have been almost pain free

1hb990i,walking,Wearing a hole into heel of new shoes twice in 6 weeks,"I started a walking regimen of \~12,000 steps a day (x7 days a week) a couple of months ago to both help lose weight and get acclimated for a long couple of walking days at Disneyland next week.

I bought some expensive new walking shoes (Hokas) on the recommendation of the owner of a local shoe store, with enough time to break them in before the trip.

After about 3 weeks, my heel had worn a hole in the rear of the left shoe, clear through so that I could touch the shoe's outer shell through it. I didn't notice until it was too late, and ended up with blisters that took me down for a few days.

I brought the shoes back to the store, and they generously agreed to exchange the shoes for a different brand that might fit better around the heel (New Balance).

3 weeks later, I've worn the same hole into the new shoes (left foot again), but noticed it before it led to blistering.

Does anyone have any advice on what I should do here? I obviously can't buy a new pair of shoes every 3 weeks,  there's not enough time now to break in another pair, and it would not be fair to try to exchange the shoes for another pair again. The Hokas and New Balance are just standard walking shoe style.

Should I attempt to fill the hole with cotton and use duct tape to patch it? More importantly, Is there any way I can *prevent* this from happening? I've been wearing blister-resistant socks, have Vaseline available, and also have some moleskin patches ready if I need them.

I have a large-frame body (6'4, over 300 lbs.), so I'm not sure how common this problem is, or what can be done about it. Presumably if I lose enough weight I'll create less impact in my shoes, but that's probably a year away.

**Edit:** to clarify, the hole I've worn is on the rear heel of the shoe, not through the bottom sole of the shoe.

1hare1d,PHRunners,Sharing my experience as a flat-footed runner,"
Hi guys! Baka may mga tao akong matulungan dito on which shoes to pick. So background, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10.5, 78kg, midfoot striker, overpronating, flat-footed. I usually run 4 times a week, 3 times ang cross-training (gym)

I started running mainly because I wanted to help myself to cut weight, that was June and my weight was 97 due to bulking season. I had my gait analysis at Asics Glorietta and found out that I have flat feet and that I was overpronating. So, here‚Äôs a review of the shoes I have ran in.

Asics GT2000 12:
(Retired at 216.3K) Ito yung shoes na nirecommend sakin ng Asics. I had a better feel of this shoe compared with the Kayano 30s since it felt firmer and had a lower stack. Helped me gain mileage on my starting months! The only problem with this shoe is that I felt na once I cross 12K, the foam loses its softness and parang I was closer to the ground. But overall, this is a great workhorse! Every now and then, I still use this shoe for walking na lang since I tend to get shin splints kapag ito yung gamit ko. But I‚Äôll give this shoe credit, I think it resolved my problem of being a flat-foot and mas nasanay na ako sa neutral.

4/5

Asics Novablast 4:
(180K) This was my solution to the issues that I had with the GT2000s. Yes, this shoe is a neutral shoe, but this shoe helped me run a longer distance - from 16-32K. My favorite daily trainer to date kasi it‚Äôs so versatile. From being an easy shoe, recovery shoe, or kahit itempo or gamitin ko for intervals, sobrang bang for the buck. Break-in period is somewhere around 30-50K.

5/5

Pegasus 41:
(37.2K) Got this shoe from the Nike Shoe Swap in Ayala Triangle. I had the 38s before and used it as an everyday shoe for my physical activities. It resolved my problem with the 38s by being more comfortable with the foot and having a wider base. I don‚Äôt usually use this often though, since ayaw ko ng masyadong mababang stack. It feels firm din pala sa foot and medyo habang tumatagal na tinatakbo mo siya mas lumalambot. The new AirZoom is *chef‚Äôs kiss*

3/5

Nike Streakfly:
(83.2K) My girlfriend bought this as a present for me. My favorite tempo and speed shoe especially on the track. Mahal na mahal ko talaga yung ZoomX ng Nike and one of the (if not the) softest foams talaga. Made me realize that sometimes I tend to overstride kasi hindi ito friendly sa heel strikers. May energy return thanks to ZoomX, and it strengthened my feet dahil I was closer to the ground. Great all-around shoe rin ito and sometimes I use this as a recovery shoe kasi sobrang lambot niya. Also, sole 

4/5

Adios Pro 3:
(133K) My first supershoe! Bought this one kasi I searched for carbon-plated shoes na stable since I was beginning pa lang noon, at ito yung shoe na lumabas according kay RunRepeat. I can say that the test is true, super stable nga nito. This shoe taught me how to correct my form when running and ito rin yung sapatos na tinuruan akong mag midfoot strike para magbenefit ako sa carbon. Loved the shoes before and I even love it now, lalo nung nabreak-in ko na siya after 100K, sobrang lumambot na siya. Ang problem ko lang dito ay yung heel lockdown, even with the runner‚Äôs knot. But still, this shoe is perfect para sakin. Amazing for tempo and speed workouts as well.

4.5/5

Alphafly 3:
(31K) Currently bought this and I was stupid enough to run this sa HOKA Finals last Sunday. I‚Äôm still getting the hang of Nike‚Äôs Flyplate kasi sobrang different niya sa Carbon Rods ng Adidas. Regardless, I love this shoe and I think this would be my main race day shoe, specifically on my half-marys and sa future marathon ko. Energy return is superb, thanks sa Zoom Pods. I found it surprisingly stable as well. On paper, it‚Äôs heavier sa AP3s pero kapag sinuot mo na parang wala ka nang suot dahil nakayakap sa paa mo yung sapatos. Hahaha! Totoo rin ang balita, maingay yung sapatos, rinig mo bawat hakbang. Which is nice kasi alam kong tama striking ko sa shoes. Lightwork na lang din legs ko dahil sa ZoomX + Flyplate + Zoom pods.

5/5

Having ran in all of these shoes, I think na wala naman talagang perfect shoes for a specific condition. Maybe I was lucky na the GT2000s ‚Äúcorrected‚Äù my feet, pero the best advice that I can give is to run in a pair that you are comfortable with. 

Yun lang, sorry for the long post. See you sa daan!

1han5m0,Shoes,Ventilating shoes cause more sweat and stench..but leather is just fine??Just me?,"So the last 4 years ive had issues with alot of sweat and smell at work. Construction/carpentry/lots of stuff. Physical.

Tried many different workshoes/worksandals and its always been the same. But this time the stores didnt have anything that made a good fit anymore.

 Thw one that actually fit, and surprisingly fit pretty damn good because of the heel-lock - were some blue leather boots made for electricians. 

 They have holes but yiu cant even breathe through. But aa the days went by i rwalized that i didnt smell. Even went as far as to see how many workdays without airing or cleaning the insoles before smell developed..also me and kid got sixk so i forgot about them for a qeek or so. But nothing! Now ive had them for 1,5 months, no cleanup other than occasional airing and dusting...and no smelly feet, no smelly socks, no smelly shoes.

Isnt this just ironic? How could a constant supply of fresh air make the feet so damn moist constantly?

As a perspective, my hoka clifton running shoes i use for daily stuff causes less sweat than Vent2, but still more than these heavy rugged leather shoes

For example I‚Äôm trying to get used to Brooks Glycerin because they fit well and are stable but after a while they feel so hard. Similar with ASICS Novablast even if I can cover more ground as they are easier to get speed


I feel like my heel is getting inflamed just because of these extremely hard shoes. I have orthotics and also 2 pairs of socks and it‚Äôs still not enough. On top of it all even my more cushioned shoes -Hokas , are flat and give me PF in opposite foot probably due to their significant heel drop compared to my old Nike shoes which had a very high foot drop.

Is it normal? Should I force myself to walk in shoes that are so hard? I did improve a little ( more like flattened my arch) but I literally don‚Äôt want to walk at all anymore. I worked months at getting better (and 4 years before the latest flare up) and I did only to wreck it when I insisted on walking in the only shoes I have- hard, flat shoes. There are no more proper cushioned shoes on the market I tried everything. I miss my old Nike Zoomx. Even my calves and ankles hurt. 

At the same time I know cushioning makes feet weak and I have been cushioning them with a high heel drop shoes for years successfully trying to recover.. my shoes disappeared off the market that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm in this mess! 

How do I strengthen them if these shoes outright hurt me like this? My very bones in the foot feel like they‚Äôre being crushed under concrete and pressure and I‚Äôm slim. Even the steroid shots are doing overtime ",2024-12-09 20:57:26+00:00,5,37

I‚Äôm starting to get back in the swing of things getting ready to start a new marathon training block and wanted to make sure my new group of new shoes had great cushion without sacrificing responsiveness. 

I was able to get these shoes around Black Friday from Nordstrom for $65 (30%+33% F&F)and couldn‚Äôt pass for the price. 

Straight out of the box you can‚Äôt ignore the great looks of this shoe with the colorway. There‚Äôs something about looking good during the run that gives me the confidence throughout the week. (I know it‚Äôs cheesy). 

I took them out today on a EZ 7 mile run. The cushion in this shoe is plush and has a very minimal (sink in) feel but is also very responsive similar to the Hoka Mach 6. Outsole is tacky and felt great and stable during wet sections on my run. Upper is super snug as it forms completely to your top foot. Very similar to the brooks Hyperion max 2. I‚Äôm a 10.5-11 since that leans towards 10.5 and wish I would have got the size 11s. If you‚Äôre in between sizes, size up. 

All in a a great shoes intially, especially for the price. Can‚Äôt wait to see how the shoe breaks in and ready to chew up some miles with them. I would highly recommend for a daily if you can find em for 100-120$ online. 

Looking for feedback on how they break it and if any v13 lovers have any other recommendations for a tempo shoe based on my write up. I have the brooks glycerin max on the way for a recovery shoe and I‚Äôm in the market for a speed session shoe. ",2024-12-07 22:50:52+00:00,113,46

1h8rgsh,RunningShoeGeeks,Puma Velocity Nitro 2 GTX,"https://preview.redd.it/cz57as927f5e1.png?width=433&format=png&auto=webp&s=11d52d12022bd0ffd61e1b8a641f45777ec72640

I recently purchased a pair for PUMA Velocity Nitro 2 GTXs this Black Friday as a winter daily trainer to possibly include in my rotation.

* User profile: M, 180cm, 70kg
* Shoe size: 28.5cm in all brands; EU44 in Puma
* Average weekly mileage: 40-50km
* Running style: neutral; fore and mid-foot striker
* Run used: 40 minutes recovery of pace \~6:00/km
* Terrain used: dry and wet road (concrete, asphalt, cobblestone) and muddy light trails

I was initially using [Asics Novablast 3s](https://runrepeat.com/asics-novablast-3) earlier this month but after days of rain and thin layers of ice on the roads, it proved to be dangerous for me. I replaced it with [Hoka Speedgoat 5](https://runrepeat.com/hoka-speedgoat-5) but wanted to try something lighter but still has a good grip on city surfaces. I never had any Puma running shoes before so I decided to try the VN2s to check out the famous Puma Grip for myself.

My first impression was the grip on the wet road: it was the grippiest of any Adidas, Asics or Hoka shoes I have ever worn and I was confident that I will be safe with it. The shoes were really light and my usual cadence of 170-180 were easy to do and not haltered by the trusted grip which was a pleasant surprised! I thought I would have to fight between those two but I didn't have any problems. 

I admit that my preference are responsive and bouncy shoes like the NB3s and I would put it a level below those but is not as flat and terrible as Asics Noosa Tri 15s and Adidas Adizero SLs which I both hated even after \~100kms of use. I've read that the VN2s will be much responsive after \~50miles/80km so I will definitely look out for that and prepare another review here. Regardless it was enjoyable and did what it had to do as a daily trainer (should I have bought the Deviate Nitros instead?).

I've read that the uppers tend to be slightly warm and since I used it on a winter day, I didn't experience any cold feet throughout the entire run and I was only wearing medium-thick socks. 

As for the length, it was also mentioned in RunRepeat that it runs long. I disagree because it was the perfect combination of snug and roomy as any 28.5cm shoes I had from other brands. Just beware that the Puma size chart is 0.5 less in their EU equivalents i.e. 28.5cm in major brands is US10.5 or EU44.5 but it is EU44 in Puma.

Unfortunately I had an small but irritating problem during the run: the laces weren't secure, they kept on untangling and I had to redo it twice until I resorted to the [runner's knot](https://www.instructables.com/The-Runners-Knot/). This is just minor and I can replace it with other laces but I didn't read anything about this quirk while reading reviews. 

In terms of the different routes I've ran on, it performed well and I actually felt the surfaces such as the muddy trails and roads filled with wet decaying leaves. I mentioned the latter because in comparison to the Vibram outsole of SG5 which is chunkier and I didn't feel the ground. This was just an observation and I have no preference unless I feel pain (mostly on flatter shoes) which there wasn't.

Overall the VN2s are a good pair of daily trainers for wet days especially with the Gore-Tex feature. It is affordable (in comparison to the other top trainers), weights light and great for daily training. I am impressed as a new Puma user! However I do not recommend it for runners with stability needs as it is flat and the insole is not supportive enough but you can remove it and put your custom ones.

Next steps: I will try it again on non-recovery days and possibly long runs to check if it will have more surprises after a certain break-in period. I am also keen on trying it on snowy days to check how the Puma Grip will fare on sleet and slightly icy roads.",2024-12-07 12:28:53+00:00,21,8

Since theres a booth here at Utmb ChiangMai having this shoe, i've decided to try (only test fit).  

Theres a few models on display, even with BOA, but i only bother to try the Fuga EX3 (the 330 is the lighter version) as i saw it on someones feet on my morning course check.  

The fitting was somewhat narrow at the feet ball, despite toebox room was fine. they have W version, n going W solved my ball tightness issue. Lenght wise, im US10.5 in hoka torrent2/sg5, n i need us10.5 in this. Im us11 in xodusU2.  

The upper is super thin mesh, very breathable. The upper at toebox felt comfortable even as when you are creasing it on toe liftoff (i tested Tomir, not comfortable)    

the midsole seems soft when poking/squeezing with finger, but wearing it, forefoot felt stiff. according to rep there is no rockplate. maybe need breaking-in? the heel however was soft, like powerrun pb soft.  The outsole is a wide platform, with full vibram.  

not a fan of that complicated lacing. Have any of you ran in this?

1h6gxou,RunningShoeGeeks,Initial thoughst on metaspeed paris edge,"Being a 6'2 210lb runner, I dont consider myself a light runner  so cushioning to me usually is a priority. For instance I love running in the superblast 2 and hoka skyward X. With that said I have put about 10 miles into the paris edge and underfoot they feel amazing. 

They feel smooth on turnover at my quicker paces and let me really just enjoy the run and felt like an extension of the stride. Im predominatly a forefoot striker, most of my workout shoes barely ever get heel marks. 
The upper is light and flexible enough, but where I am dissapointed is that i feel like they run small, I wear a US  13 in almost every shoe, but the edge paris felt like they were atleast a half size smaller then the skyward X or superblast 2. Which led to some pretty not great bruising at the end of the runs. 

Phenomenal shoe, if it fits I cant reccomend it enough, I think for my own uses though ill be looking to part with them since the bruising is not worth it with other great options available.  I do wish asics made a bigger size in their top tier shoes. I think they stop at 13 in their race models.",2024-12-04 14:12:20+00:00,85,36
1h6ahyi,RunningShoeGeeks,First run review ASICS NOVABLAST 5 ,"About me, 26 year old male, typically Nike & Hoka runner, alternating between long distance trail runs & flat medium distance usually for recovery. 

Was looking for something a little more stable and comfortable to run all distances on easy terrain with & drawn to pre release reviews.

Tested on the treadmill for a fair while in store at ASICS (who were great) the day earlier while purchasing and immediately comfortable with the breathable but tight fitting upper/tongue of the shoe. The response from the midsole when landing and natural role forward to the toes became another relaxing feeling compared to other shoes where it‚Äôs felt more forced by my deliberate foot strike & take off patterns.

Location was tested on a double loop of a quick local gravel park run. Absolutely no issues re grip which has proven important to me with previous shoes (although it was a bone dry day).

With a previous broken fib, support is something that‚Äôs been an almost immediate tell all to me with different shoes, but this provided comfortable & noticeable distance between me and the ground without going full Mizuno Wave. 

Few quick strides in the run gave more green flags with response at pace felt off the forced easy roll onto my toes.

10km felt like enough time spent with these shoes to decide that they will be a very welcomed all distance shoe to me.

Did also notice a cut of foam scraped out of the inner midsole of the shoe, hopefully this isn‚Äôt a reoccurring thing as I run more often in these (guessing this happened as my shoes hit in running motion?). ",2024-12-04 07:20:07+00:00,109,24

1h5xxge,FootFunction,Hiking boots - Has anybody tried Hanwag?,"Has anybody tried the bunion fit version of Hanwag boots?

I have the original Hoka Sky Kaha boots, they still work ok for me and are comfortable but are beaten up now and I have been looking for a replacement for an upcoming multi day wilderness trip.  I have wide feet and also have HL with spurs on both toe joints, not huge but enough that I need a wide and high toe box. 

My issue has been that I do not just need wide, I need high too.  For example I have recently ordered and tried a number of boots that according to reviews are as wide as they come but none of them worked for me.  All were half to a full size up and the models were Keen Targhee III, Keen Pyrenees, Keen Circadia and Merrell Moab, all were wide enough but none of them had enough height in the box and so they pressed on the toe joint.

This week somebody recommended Hanwag a brand I had not heard of before and they offer a bunion fit with extra room in the toe box.  I have ordered the Alta III HTX bunion in 2 sizes to try, I was procrastinating between them and the Tatra bunion but the Tatra‚Äôs looked heavier and less suited to what I need.  Now I have ordered them though I am questioning my choice but also questioning overall whether Hanwag are going to work.  The bunion part looks interesting but looking at the photos they do seem to taper in at the toes so I am worried that they might just be too narrow.

Anybody on here tried the Hanwag?",2024-12-03 20:56:11+00:00,1,4

**Background**:  
I‚Äôm seeking advice for chronic pain in my right heel, caused by insertional Achilles tendonitis and a heel spur pressing against the Achilles.

I‚Äôve been trying to lose weight and have made some progress, but as you can imagine, getting active is incredibly difficult when walking itself is so painful.

* **Left ankle**: I tore my left Achilles over a year ago, had surgery, and it‚Äôs completely healed with no ongoing issues.
* **Right ankle**: Pain has been persistent for over a year. It‚Äôs located at the back of my heel where the Achilles attaches. The area is tender to touch, and walking uphill is particularly excruciating. I often feel a burning sensation after sitting down following activity.

# Treatments I‚Äôve Tried:

* Physical therapy, stretches, and exercises as recommended by my podiatrist.
* Shoes and insoles (Hokas, On Clouds, various orthotics) ‚Äì no improvement.
* Medications (Tylenol, Aleve, Ibuprofen, Nabumetone) ‚Äì no relief.
* Topical treatments (Voltaren gel), a TENS machine, and icing ‚Äì none have helped.

My podiatrist keeps recommending stretches and wearing a boot when it hurts. While I trust him, I feel stuck and need more guidance.

# My Daily Challenges:

* I limp due to the pain, and my commute involves walking uphill, which worsens it.
* The pain only subsides when I‚Äôm off my feet or wearing a boot.

1h4cbu5,PlantarFasciitis,One month update: things that worked for me ,"I am on mobile so couldn't link my previous post. Apologies. But i was asking for advice for my limping about a month ago (the pain was that bad). Thanks to everyone on this sub, i learned so many things and yesterday i had my first hour long walk with my dog without any pain before during or after our walk. I am ecstatic! 

So i wanted to share things that worked for me hoping it might help someone. I have mid/high arch slim feet

1) oofos slides didn't work for me. Nothing bad, but didn't help. Hoka ones though are godsend. Ugliest yet comfiest slides i have ever worn. 

2) a good physiotherapist. I got lucky to be able to get a PT person who was so kind and patient with me. He explained the exercises, the logics behind them and respected my pace of doing them. I saw him 3 times over 3 weeks.

3) taping. My pt did the taping and my god! How helpful that was! Early on it was extra painful the day of the taping but i started stepping on my foot comfortably the next day. He explained that it provides a similar support with an insole, which made total sense to me

4)icing after work/being on my foot, heating after I rest (at night etc) 

5) using a cane. It was my initial question in the sub and at the end i had to use one. There was no other way for me to go to work and turns out it was a good decision. PT recommended minimizing the weight on my foot as well. 

6) i religiously followed the exercise regiment (heel raise (first while sitting then after some improvement standing up), towel grab with toes, massage, ""toe yoga"" and of course calf stretches). I did them first thing in the morning and right before i go to bed with calf stretches and massages throughout the day. 

7) i still don't have hoka bondis and brooks ghost :) i wasnt able to get a fitting while my foot was taped so it is still on my to do list. However, i tried whatever shoes i had and consulted with my PT for each one of them. Most comfortable ones that I own: keen and columbia hiking shoes and boots. Random adidas cloudfoams that i got from costco last year are actually pretty alright for me as well. All my adidas classics as well as dress / work shoes are no go. I will try them with the insoles this week though. 

8) that post in this sub that gave some tips about pacing yourself (if it hurts the next day, dial it down) is brilliant. I use it for exercises for sure, but also shoes. 

Again thank you everyone who contributes to this sub. It was super helpful for me. I hope this post helps someone as well. ",2024-12-01 20:14:22+00:00,46,8
1h4bnys,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Skyward X - 100 km review so far. ,"1st Review. Go easy. 

About me: 34m 84kg. Mainly football (soccer) and gym. Got into running last Christmas and got the bug. Forefoot striker in the main / mid when tired. 21:20 5k is the only time I‚Äôve run to time (Hungover). 

How I‚Äôve used the shoe: Having sold all my previous shoes in a clear out (Bostons and ES3 and 1080v13) these have been used mainly for easy to tempo for the past 2 months or so. Paces of around 4:30 / km - 5:35 / km. Most are zone 2/3 managing my mileage around other sporting commitments. 

Upper: Comfy and hugging. Compared to the boston upper these are night and day. Easy to lockdown and I haven‚Äôt noticed a single hotspot or issue with rubbing. No issues with heat but that could be time of the year. Compared to other shoes I‚Äôve worn. 

Midsole: It‚Äôs some stack alright. It‚Äôs been a really enjoyable experience having a shoe I know protects my legs and joints. Plenty squish but more than enough return at the paces I‚Äôve used it. The plate definitely helps when I‚Äôve turned up the pace in bursts. You can just sit and cruise along without thought as the rocker plus this midsole setup just seems to work. Wouldn‚Äôt be anything I‚Äôd reach for for fast speed work but when my legs are tired from lifting or football these are just prime. There‚Äôs absolutely no ground feel which was an odd feeling at first. 

Outsole: It doesn‚Äôt seem to be wearing down much at all so far. The grip is there, I‚Äôve run on pavement , very light trail. Both in dry and wet with mushy leaves etc. I‚Äôve not had any issues with slipping so that‚Äôs a plus. It‚Äôs not adidas level but it‚Äôs certainly more than enough. I wouldn‚Äôt be taking corners at any speed with the stack being this high due to my like for having working ankles, but I‚Äôve no doubt it would be capable.

Overall I would recommend if you‚Äôre looking for a shoe that can chew up the miles and protect your legs. Hope this is useful. Thanks for looking. ",2024-12-01 19:46:20+00:00,114,43

1h3tnkx,RunningShoeGeeks,ON Cloudboom Zone Initial Impressions ,"38 miles ran on these shoes so far

About me: Male, 5ft6, 140lbs, heel strike, flat feet, 170-185 cadence, averaging 40 miles per week

Types of runs: Easy/Recovery run (8-8:30/mile), 10 mile long run (7:40/mile), 5x1000 at 5k pace (5:53-6:06/mile) Track Workout, 400 meter repeats Track Workout (75s average split)

Upper: For how expensive this shoe is, I expected a lot better. The upper is comfortable but the laces aren‚Äôt long enough to do a runner‚Äôs knot and my heel isn‚Äôt fully locked. This wasn‚Äôt a big problem and didn‚Äôt affect my running but still an annoyance. True to size. 

Ride: At first I wasn‚Äôt impressed with the ride but I warmed up to it as I broke the shoe in and put on more miles. The ride doesn‚Äôt blow me away which isn‚Äôt ideal for a $210 shoe, but is still very solid and works very well for a variety of paces. The shoe is very lightweight and responsive. It truly shines on track workouts, as I was able to feel the bounce and response of Peba foam the most when I was running faster paces. At slower paces the shoe is comfortable and I enjoyed it for my easy runs, even if it‚Äôs not meant for them. I wish the rocker was more noticeable, as I generally prefer shoes with a strong rocker (for example Hoka Mach 6).

Conclusion: Great shoe, but the price is definitely ridiculously high, even for a full Peba shoe. For a much cheaper price you can buy the Hoka Mach 6, Brooks Hyperion 2, New Balance Rebel v4, or many other options that can fill the same purpose. You can think of this shoe as the listed trainers but with Peba. If you aren‚Äôt concerned with pricing then I think you will enjoy this shoe. I certainly enjoy it and look forward to putting more miles. I just wish it wasn‚Äôt $210.",2024-12-01 03:05:13+00:00,61,21
1h3t82u,PlantarFasciitis,PF Causing Depression,"I didn't know if I need advice or just to vent. My foot started to hurt in the beginning of Fall and I saw a podiatrist in early October. I 100% caused this with new flip flops this summer. I'm now in either Brooks Ghosts or Adrenalines for exercise or walking and Hoka Ora slides in the house. I have those generic orthodics and am getting custom ones made. The night boot killed my foot and made it worse. I tried a soft night splint and it was not as painful but didn't seem to help. I follow a stretching and foot strengthening routine I found here that was approved by my podiatrist. I apply ice and heat for 10 minutes each followed by a [massage with a spoon](https://youtu.be/8u5I-ipWSYc?si=RB1fP_bzBKaYochs&fbclid=IwY2xjawG4pqJleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHS_EZl2uv7wGaskT5yV2cnooTtBM1ERNR36qNM6dOu8APG_OPO3WmZPeVw_aem_6bIkNsVpNg7DzP0UsVu26A). The pain is better most days from when it first started, but still there. 

Here is my problem. My regular workout routine is PIIT28 which is HIIT cardio mixed with Pilates. I took time off from exercising completely but became really depressed and tried to ease back in and modify. I exercise on carpet with shoes on and my foot doesn't hurt while I'm exercising but can feel worse later. So I changed my routine to avoid high impact. Now I do gentle strength training (dumbbells, ankle weights, resistance bands) and bought a used rowing machine. This doesn't feel as intense as PIIT28 and apparently that particular routine was the only thing helping my insomnia and keeping my mental health together. My foot still hurts with the weights and rowing so I'm frustrated. I tried just going for a gentle walk the other day and my unaffected foot started to hurt! 

I'm a stay at home mom, I don't get out, I don't really have a life, I go to bed at 8pm and don't even get to watch TV anymore. The one thing I did just for myself was to wake up at 4am, listen to an audiobook, and exercise. I hate my new routine and I don't even know if it helps because my foot is still bothered. It's picky, I know, but if I'm counting reps of exercise moves I can't pay attention to my audiobook. With PIIT28 everything was on a timer so I didn't have to count. I was 35 days away from finishing the entire series of programs and I was so proud. Now I don't know if I have to give it up for good. 

Had anyone had to quit a high impact routine for PF and was able to go back to it?  I'm 41 and not overweight. I've already had to give up running when I had my daughter and now I feel like I'm losing my main source of stress relief. ",2024-12-01 02:42:17+00:00,16,20

1h32jid,PlantarFasciitis,Kind of worried,"Hello All!üòä

I thought I'd be able to ride out this pain however I'm failing miserably.

A little bit about myself,I'm a 55yo female,5'6"" tall & being honest here, over 200#. I live in NE ND, have been here since '89&have been through snow storms that would probably kill a normal personüòÇ Kidding aside,I believe that the cold does play a major factor in pain. I also work a retail job where I'm literally standing all day long. By the time my average day is done,I usually have between 20-22,000 steps in so I'm not exactly a lazy lump.
I've tried every shoe (Hoka, Asics,Nike,Adidas,Reebok)hoping that the next new shoe will be ""the answer to my pain"". I've tried so many different orthotics, I could open my own store!
The biggest thing(besides the astronomical pain) is that I also have raging pain on the outside of my right ankle in addition to having my foot feel like it's in a vise grip constantly. It's affecting the way I walk which only makes the pain  worse.
My other big fear right now is that I absolutely can not bend my foot back towards my calf(kind of like a tippy toe motion)at all without the pain sending me in to orbit.
Like most people,I can't just quit my job to figure this out(see if resting it)would help or not.
I kind of feel like I'm at the end of my rope here. The pain literally dictates every second day of every day which makes me really irritable.
If anyone could offer any advice,I will definitely read each reply with an open mind.

1h287pa,sesamoid,"Joining the club, and looking for more information to make the most of my recovery","I'm (sadly) joining the sesamoiditis club with a fractured sesamoid.

I was basically in shock after my recent, first podiatrist appointment when I walked out of the office with a boot on. Initial recovery plan is 6 weeks in a boot, followed by (hopefully) more conservative treatment.

Because I was in shock, I didn't really think of all the questions I wanted to ask. But I've had some time to think and since found this subreddit, so I thought I'd ask here about what's worked for you all:

* How do I actually make the best use of the boot? Doc told me I should basically be in the boot whenever I‚Äôm on my feet, aside from the shower. What about when I‚Äôm not on my feet? For example, when I‚Äôm sitting on the couch or at my desk for extended periods of time, should I keep the boot on, or should I remove it?
* As I‚Äôve been walking around on my boot for ~24 hours now, I notice that I still ‚Äúfeel‚Äù when I take a step on my affected foot. Does this suggest that the boot is ill fitting or doesn‚Äôt have enough padding, or is this to be expected?
* Even with the boot, should I reduce my daily step count, or even go so far as to reduce the amount of time I‚Äôm on my feet in general?
* What else can I be doing to aid my recovery? Should I be doing RICE stuff like keeping my foot elevated, hot or cold therapy, or buying some sort of additional foot wrap?
* Thinking post-boot, I got some Hoka Bondi 8s to replace my New Balance sneakers. What else should I be using along with these new shoes? Tape? Foot pads? Orthotics? Doc mentioned some type of toe splint that‚Äôs available on Amazon, but I forget the keywords I need to use to find some options.

I'd appreciate answers to these questions, or any other ideas y'all have to make the most of my recovery.",2024-11-28 23:12:03+00:00,2,5
1h23iie,FootFunction,Help diagnose extreme pain depending on footware,"Hey guys, 

 Two issues here

- both of my ankles crack with every single step. These are super loud and sound like a whip cracking. They have been this way all my life and while I wouldn't ever describe it as painful, it is really annoying to deal with and can at worst be mildly uncomfortable when it snaps.

- I decided to get more into running lately and shoes feel like they're impossible to find. I got some $140 Hokas but I end up with extreme pain in my feet, on the outer most edge of my feet, and then on the inside of my foot. 


I think my steps are supinated so I got an insole, although I'm not sure how much this will help because my feet are flatter than a mirror.

1h1wtj4,hiking,Hiking boots drop - how critical and will I notice a change?,"Hi all,

I currently have the original Hoka Sky Kahas.  I  do not hike in them regularly due to where I live (were last used in September hiking up Gable in the Lakes) and they probably get around 10 outings a year.  They have been well used though and have served me well on both single and multi day hikes.  I do though have flipper feet so whilst they are wide-ish I have removed the insole to get the toe wiggle room I like.

  
The reason I am potentially looking to replace them is I am due to do the Gokyo lakes circuit to Everest base camp in March next year which at 14 days hiking is the longest I have done, so I am thinking that I would like to have both the full cushioning and the wiggle room!  I have narrowed my choices down to the Keen Pyrenees, Targhee III (or IV) and the Merrell Moab 3 GTX and have all 3 coming on Amazon try before you buy.  

The thing is though in reading some reviews it seems that all 3 have a significantly higher drop than my Hokas, 16.5mm (Pyrenees) 13.5mm (Merrells) and 13mm/14mm for the Targhee III/IV this is compared to the 6mm on the Hokas which TBF is a low number for hiking boots.  This assumes that the 6mm figure Hoka provides is correct, the cut in half guy has measured the newer Kaha model at 11.5mm vs the same 6mm stated so who knows?

I have no injuries to cater for but I have just turned 50 so am mindful of hammering my joints or introducing something new that could alter things.  Having said that as I mentioned I do not wear the Hokas often so maybe not that jarring a difference I will notice?  Of the 3 I am looking at I like the look of the Pyrenees the best, and they have the highest drop of the bunch.

1h1lpvb,RunningShoeGeeks,unfortunately for you it was me: a review of the Adidas Evo SL after 10 miles & much waiting,"# general notes on my likes & preferences as they apply to shoes

as my flair‚Äôd suggest, i‚Äôve¬†*really*¬†been enjoying Adidas‚Äô running shoes. the adios 3 was my second super-shoe and was my first moment of, ‚Äúwoah, shoes can do that?‚Äù and i‚Äôve got \~300 mi between 2 pair. (my experience w/ the endorphin pro 3 was good, but not comparable.) the boston 12 was my first ‚Äúsuper-trainer,‚Äù and i‚Äôve put \~900 miles across 3 pairs. love the SL2 since buying it in June, at \~190 miles in em so far. i‚Äôm about to hit 100 in my pxsv1, but i only use those for long runs. me gusta adidas, as we say down in argentina.¬†

i find adidas shoes really fit my feet well ‚Äî i have a quite wide foot at the metatarsals, but regular width at the arch & heel, basically shaped like a triangle. high volume foot. adidas‚Äô lasts as of lately have been basically set up to reward that, with the combination of the rods in the AP3 & B12, and the use of LSP in the SL2. (it‚Äôs worth noting the one shoe this is not true of; the takumi sen series, at least the 8/9, did not fit my foot in either my ap3/b12/sl2/evosl/psx/adios size, a size 12. or even fit comfortably a half-size up. so imo, if you have a wide foot, most \*all\* of adidas‚Äô line is available to you, but NOT the takumi sen series.)

i‚Äôm also crazy about lightstrike pro ‚Äî it‚Äôs my favorite foam i‚Äôve touched by a mile, second-fav is probably the flytefoam turbo present in the superblast. i‚Äôm heavy (200 lbs), and i find that LSP rewards high-power landings more than other foams i‚Äôve tried (specifically recently that‚Äôd be the peba in Saucony‚Äôd Speed 3/Pro3 that i‚Äôm blanking on the name of for some reason.)

so the Evo SL was my most anticipated shoe of 2024/5 for me ‚Äî exactly what i liked already, but without the rods that make the AP3 unfit as a daily trainer (if you believe it‚Äôs a good daily trainer, i love you, i see you, and you‚Äôre deluding yourself! hope this helps). but it‚Äôs just been impossible to get. many such cases!

luckily a fella also in NYC was selling theirs over at r/runningrack (go sub), and within the course of about 5 hours i managed to pick them up.

# visual impressions

i mean, they definitely look as good as you thought they did. maybe you thought ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no way it looks that good in real life?‚Äù but there is, and they do. if you didn‚Äôt love pics of the design then you probably won‚Äôt love it. but for me, there is a 5x mental joy modifier that gets applied to any run where i think the shoe looks \*really\* good, and that‚Äôs how i‚Äôve felt in my runs w/ the shoe so far.

# comfort

‚Ä¶ is excellent, and shoes adidas clearly learning from their mistakes with a speed that feels meaningful (cough nike cough). upper on the b12/ap3 sucked, but adidas‚Äô technical mesh uppers on the SL and SL2 were nice, new ap4 upper is apparently great, and the upper on the Evo SL feels \*very familiar\* to that on the SL2 (unrelated ‚Äî i feel like adidas‚Äô naming scheme here w/ the SL series is a self-own long the line of xbox‚Äôs ‚Äúseries‚Äù debacle. this could have been easy!). laces are closer to the boston 12 than those in the SL2, but i haven‚Äôt experienced any meaningful lace bite, and my high-volume foot makes me susceptible to it.¬†

# first runs

i did 4 mi the first day i got them, with a mix of tempo paces (\~7:30 min/mi) and easy effort (\~9:30 min/mi), with a handful of stride accelerations at the end (\~6:45 min/mi). the tempo pace was accidental and psychological, that thing where you put on a new shoe and you wanna run fast just to see what it can do. and it‚Äôs interesting, the feeling of the shoe ‚Äî there‚Äôs a \*hint\* of uncanny valley if you‚Äôve run a lot in the AP3, because the feeling underfoot of a thick slab of LSP foam is so familiar, but with 2 major differences: 1, there are no rods to boost propulsion, and 2, the rocker is in a meaningfully different spot.

re: point 1, i found the shoe actually slightly \*less\* stable than the AP3 ‚Äî i don‚Äôt really need stability in my shoes, i land on the lateral edge of my midfoot, but i noticed when turning corners & running on unstable ground. my running theory (nice) is that the rods take chat‚Äôs effectively a chaotic vector chart and aligns the vectors just north/south ‚Äî propelling your foot forward off the ground, but not propelling it to the side. so in the absence of the carbon rods of the ap3, the shoe feels equally \*bouncy\* but less \*propulsive\*, as there‚Äôs far less ‚Äúcall‚Äù to lean forward & engage pace.

point 2, i‚Äôm not sure where i land on the moved rocker yet. what i liked about the 70% rocker on the ap3 was that if gave the shoe a ‚Äúflat‚Äù feel. but the new 60% point rocker definitely has me up on my toes a little more ‚Äî i find they pull me forward into a quicker running position than the SL2 do. but that‚Äôs what‚Äôs a bit odd here ‚Äî without the rods present, the shoe is relatively \*less\* pace demanding than the Boston 12 or Adios Pro 3; yet the rocker position makes it, in another way, \*more\* aggressive than those 2. huh!

overall, though, the shoe is a wonderful ride ‚Äî it‚Äôs meaningfully more pace-flexible than the AP3 or B12, but i think it loses in pace flexibility to the SL2. the SL2 can handle top-end speed just as well as the Evo SL, but the Evo SL lost to the SL2 at my slowest paces (\~9:30 easy miles). it handles thudding downhills with aplomb, but accelerates up inclines with ease due to how light they are. i mean it‚Äôs just nuts to experience it; it‚Äôs quite good.

today i did 7ish miles on them, and wore them out to get pizza afterwards (without staining them with sauce!). they‚Äôre excellent easy run shoes, but again, that 60% rocker definitely made me push into the 8:30s when i was aiming for 9:30s ‚Äî i think my body learning how to utilize a rocker like that at different paces may take a bit more adjustment time than the meager 10 miles i‚Äôve gotten so far. and it‚Äôs worth noting again: they look like a million bucks. there‚Äôs even the fun mindgames aspect of it w/ other runners where it‚Äôs like, wait, is that big guy wearing Adios Evo Pro 1s to jog 9:30 min miles? i mean i know no-one‚Äôs thinking about it like that; just a fun what-if.

# conclusion

i was right in that it was basically everything i‚Äôve wanted in a daily trainer: a light, fast, sexy shoe that \*can\* go quick, but doesn‚Äôt \*make\* you, and one without any structural enhancements (plates/rods/etc). these are those! and while they‚Äôre not revolutionary, they \*absolutely\* feel like the market turning a corner w/r/t the quality of ‚Äúbasic‚Äù running shoes. i think a lot of running shoe manufacturers are slowing their EVA foam usage, but some (hoka! nike too) continue to use eva & supercritical eva in their lower-market shoe offerings. but with adidas offering this for $150? this is the thing in tech, too ‚Äî the real advantage of incredible iphones isn‚Äôt incredible iphones ‚Äî it‚Äôs that the median low-end phone will be¬†*much*¬†better. and i think the Evo SL is going to become the template of a specific kind of daily trainer that, hopefully, we‚Äôll see more versions of from brands.¬†

1h1lafe,trailrunning,anyone hypermobile folks here? how are you managing/avoiding chronic injury? ,"hey folks - I've (30F) been getting back into trail running the last few months and have been in what feels like a constant struggle with post tib tendonitis and am feeling really frustrated. 

**Disclaimer up front since it's Reddit:** yes, I've already seen a doctor (multiple) and been in PT for the last three months on and off. Scheduled some time with an ortho doc for mid Dec., but no one near us has a hypermobility focus, so we'll see what comes of that. Would love some ideas/commiseration from the community here from folks dealing with similar stuff. 

I've been active my entire life (30 now) and have had occasional weirdness with my knees/legs at some points, but that tends to be reflective of me being too lax about PT/strength training/regular yoga/core work. The last three months, I've been working with a running coach and a physical therapist (and doing every PT exercise under the sun to strengthen the area with them) and still cannot shake this issue. We've messed with volume, cross training with bike/elliptical, changing shoes (switching to Hoka Challengers helped a ton), changing the warm ups to focus on specific muscle activation, tried muscle scraping, etc. 

so...if there are any folks here who are hypermobile (particularly in the lower body): how are you managing your hypermobility symptoms and what are you doing for preventative care? what has been your biggest lesson/change to how you were training that made a difference? are there any local gods or deities I should be praying to/doing rain dances for before my runs?

1h03k7v,RunningShoeGeeks,Nike Zoom Fly 6 - Did we just become best friends ? ,"Background:
* Forefoot Striker
* Supinator
* 40 year old male
* 5‚Äô10/155 lbs
* 50-75 Km a week
* Half - 1:31:06
* 10K - 40:24

Super trainers/ Carbon plated shoes I‚Äôve used:
-Hoka Cielo X1 - 200km
-ASICS Superblast - over 1000km
-NB SC Trainer V1 - over 600km
-NB RC Elite v2 - over 600km
-Adidas Adizero adios pro v3 - 350km

I didn‚Äôt intend to buy these but was looking for a replacement for my Superblasts and because I live in a market where NOTHING is available (South Korea),  got these on a whim because they were on sale for 150,000 won (about $108 USD)

First Run: uptempoish 12.9 km/4:55 (8 mi/7:55)

Upper: Great upper. Feels substantial but not too heavy. Got my regular size 8.5 and fits well with no heel slippage issues. 

Midsole: Midsole is smooth. The first few KMs I actually wasn‚Äôt impressed but it got better as the run progressed. The midsole seems very smooth but not poppy or bouncy to me. The plate doesn‚Äôt really pop or propel but rather guides. I love the Cielo X1 but sometimes I really have to control my stride because of how bouncy it is. The Zoom Fly 6 just seems to glide in comparison.  I think some people could use these for easy runs, but I don‚Äôt think I can. The plate isn‚Äôt as stiff as others but I could still feel it at slower paces. Even though the stack is high, it didn‚Äôt feel wobbly and felt stable throughout. 

Verdict: I found my middle shoe for my rotation. While no where as versatile (or light) as the Superblast or as fun as the Cielo X1.  This shoe on the first run made the miles enjoyable at a faster pace. It doesn‚Äôt have the ‚Äúwow‚Äù factor that some others might, but it is smooth and comfortable.

* 30 miles a week / 3 runs a week
* 5K : 19min / 10K : 41 min / HM : 1:30min

Context:

Been using a couple a speed shoes for the month and this is the first time I am actually amazed for a pair of shoes wich is not carbon platet. No blister issues, no heel slippage, just fun and fast runs. And I love that color.

Currently using Saucony Speed 4 and Adidas Boston 12 as my up tempo and speed training shoes.

|**Upper (TOP = SES4)**|Narrow but the feeling is not harsh on foot. It is snug. Race feeling when putting them on|More space than the hoka when sizing down. I find the mesh very confortable|Snug racing feet, less confortable than the hoka, less easier to put it on|
|**Insole**|Removable|Removable|Removable|
|**Midsole (TOP = HMX2)**|Very reactive and bouncy out of the box, same feeling as the PDNE3. Feel like you are assisted to go faster and ease your effort to pick up the pace when you need it. Really impressive magic there|Very cushionned and stable for a speed trainer. Transition for heel to toe is great and done without any effort. Still, not very bouncy and I do not really feel the plastic plate untless i go all out in the shoes (which I personally think it takes some more effort to do than the other 2)|Bouncy but a bit stiff, really reactive shoes but you do feel the ground contact there. Rods support you a lot also to keep up the pace.|
|**Outsole (TOP = AB12)**|Less grippy than the other 2 on the first (rainy) run|Not equivalent to the boston 12 but still a good grip.|Best of the 3 without hesitation. No matter the weather they do fanstastic|
|**Ride (TOP = HMX2)**|Light and bouncy ride that make you think you are using a racing shoe. Those shoes make you feel you need to work harder to handle them. There are a great motivation and trainer for wanting to get better. the heel to toe transition is really great for a heel stricker|Very confortable and light. Very versatile overall and confortable at slower pace if you need to. Compared to the other two this is the only one I feel I can use for everything. compared to the other 2, they seems really flat|Best fast winter shoe I own for now but not the most confortable ride. I do feel it is difficult to use them for more the 15km as you can really feel the ground in them. Nevertheless they really come alive at fast pace|
|**Personal usage**|Anaerobic/VO2max/Tempo/threshold|Anaerobic/VO2max/Tempo/easy runs/threshold|Anaerobic/VO2max/Tempo/threshold|

**Conclusion**

Overall, I think I will reach to the Mach X2 for every speed session as of now to confirm they are my current best option.

Will sell the B12 as they are the less comfortable out of the 3 (confort > grip it seems)

Will keep the Speed 4 as my versatile option.

1gz2lc7,trailrunning,Learnings from a Double Dipsea each day this week,"I was looking for a challenge to end 2024, and decided to try running a Double Dipsea each day this week. I was curious to see how my body would hold up to trail + elevation after only \~20 trail runs on the year (but a lot of road miles/lifting). I had a blast getting to know the Dipsea in various conditions, and meeting a couple folks who run a lot of trails.

Times (elapsed)

* Day 1: 2:43:12 (fasted)
* Day 2: 2:36:36 (tons of pastries)
* Day 3: 2:41:20 (no water)
* Day 4: 2:29:58 (gus, no stop @ Parkside)
* Day 5: 2:37:11
* Day 6: 3:56:23 (ran with partner)

Gear:

* Hoka Torrent 3 (5 days) + Asics Fuji Lite 3 (1 day). Ran Day 6 with the Asics, and Day 6 was much slower, so hard to compare.
* Shoved pastries in pockets, did not carry anything. Relied on water fountains

Some learnings from 6 days...

* Deer also tend to hang in the same spots :).
* Favorite section: wooded section above Steep Ravine
* It is truly wild to me that people run the Dipsea in well under an hour.
* Pastries: Favorites were the Bread Pudding Muffin from Parkside (weekends only), egg+cheese English muffin from Mill Valley Baking Co and Bialy from Madrona.
* Had trouble sleeping - after doing some research, seems can be common after intense/prolonged exercise.
* Looking at my Strava segments (vs. 2x Double Dipsea in early 2024), the area I have mostly gotten faster is the downhills.
* Recovery: Body held up pretty well - which I partially attribute to the lifting. I had nearly 2500 miles on road and was lifting 2x per week (my main goal was to be in 1000lb powerlifting shape + 3hr marathon ie. r/1003club).",2024-11-24 21:51:45+00:00,7,2

1gxuw90,PlantarFasciitis,It gets better..,"Just wanted to post this for those who are feeling constant pain and a bit hopeless.

I first felt the soreness about 12 months ago and very soon it became impossible to go for a 10 min walk without pain. Mornings getting out of bed was painful. Formal shoes were locked away. I‚Äôm a very active person and it was horrible not able to stay on my feet for more than 5 mins. 

What worked:

1. Hoka Ora 3 recovery slides - got two pairs one for indoors and one for outdoor use. Never step a foot on ground barefoot. 

2. ASICS Gel Nimbus for office commute

3. Shockwave sessions - had about 8 sessions over 2 months. It made the fascia sore for a bit bit but about 1 month after the sessions, I started to feel much better and now pain free for almost 2 months

4. Dipping my feet in warm water with epsom salts every night for a few weeks (this may be a mental thing but did feel like it relaxed my fascia & increased blood flow)

5. I now use gel heel pads in all my shoes and arch support pads when I‚Äôm wearing formal shoes so that my arch‚Äôs don‚Äôt fall inwards. Both pretty cheap ordered from eBay. 


Best part is with the arch support pads and gel heel cushions, I can now go for longer walks (up to 90mins) and don‚Äôt feel any pain afterwards for the rest of the day.  Sometimes I can go out without them as well but just taking it slow before increasing the load on the feet.

I recently bought some Hoka Speedgoat's 6 recommended by the local running shop for wide feet. They are great in everyway, especially the cushioning, but unfortunately they pinch the inside of my foot. After running a few kilometres on every run they start pinching, I have tried everything to combat this, but unfortunately I cannot solve the issue of the pinching.

Has anyone had this issue?

Could anyone recommend some alternative wide fit trail runners with similar cushioning?

Thanks.

In the fab is a different story. Since the large sized bootie is a little too small while the extra large sized bottie is a little too big, trying to keep the bootie sole from slipping I'm having to strap it down tighter.

1gvpxtq,PHRunners,Guide to buying your FIRST running shoes for beginners,"Hello, 

It's me again! Since di ako makatakbo msyado because of the ""flu"", let's talk about buying your first running shoes. 

**DISCLAIMER**: this is strictly based on my personal opinion and experience -

So yun nga, you got into running and now you're ditching your ultraboost/nike free/gym shoes to get your first actual running shoe. 

Here are things you should consider BEFORE buying a pair: 

**1. Width of your feet**   
  
\- to me, this is the biggest thing to consider. If the shoe doesn't fit well because it's either too snug or too wide, chances are you most likely won't enjoy running and could even potentially injure yourself 

**2. Budget** 

\- nowadays we are spoiled with many options that can range from PHP5,000-PHP17,000. Of course important factor is how much we are willing to spend for the shoe 

**3. Function** 

\- maraming types of running shoes and here is a breakdown:  

***a. Daily Trainers*** \- usually neutral with standard stack height. Doesn't have the ""fancy"" technology of other shoes but gets the job done. They are also usually the most stable.   
*ex: Nike Pegasus 41, NB 1080 v14, Adidas Adizero SL, Asics Novablast 5*  
  
***b. Super Trainers*** \- daily trainers with some sort of race foam in it, sometimes also a ""plate"" making it useful for all kinds of runs whether tempo, intervals, LSD, and even race day   
*ex: Asics Superblast 2, NB SC Trainer, Adidas Boston 12, Nike Zoom Fly 6*  
  
***c. Max Cushion*** \- prioritizes comfort. Usually tall in stack and makapal talaga foam to give you that ""malambot"" sensation when running. Great for logging in daily mileage as well as for LSD   
*ex: Asics Gel Nimbus, NB More V5, ON CloudEclipse* 

***d. Race Shoes*** \- Equipped with latest technology with the foam and materials. Includes are carbon plate for energy return. Usually PHP12000 - 17000.   
*ex: Adizero Adios Pro 3, Nike Alpha and Vaporfly, NB EC Elite, Asics Metaspeed Sky Paris*

***e. Utility*** \- clustering ""tempo"" and ""track"" shoes here. Usually used for ""key workout"" sessions like intervals, fartlek, or other speed or technical runs. Can be minimal stack with a plate but we're seeing more higher stack shoes in this category nowadays.   
*ex: Adizero Takumi, Asics Magic Speed, Nike Pegasus Plus*

**4. GAIT cycle** 

\- this relates with your running form whether you're a forefoot, midfoot, or heel striker as well as your pronations. There are shoes that are great with specific GAIT cycles. 

*you can have your GAIT analyzed in stores like Asics High Street, Runnr High Street, Hoka SM Aura etc.* 

**Questions you might want to ask yourself before buying: What will I be using the shoes for?**   
  
\- pwede mo tanong sa sarili mo if you'll be using the shoe as an all around-er or for a specific purpose like training only or speed only or race only. This will help you make the decision on what the best pair for your case would be 

Yun lang, if I missed anything - let's continue the discussion sa thread! Hopefully makatulong to sa nag hahanap ng kanilang first running shoe. 

If you have questions regarding a specific pair, ask ahead rin - I'll try to answer! ",2024-11-20 13:51:28+00:00,49,12

1guc7gz,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Mach X 2 - Review after 30km .. Wow,"**My profile:** (if you need it before the TLDR)

6' / 175lbs / heel-to-midfoot striker / 3:44 MP & 1:40 HMP & run about 40-50km/week

Recent shoes : Novablast 4 / Endorphin Pro 3 / CBoston 12 (retired), I was specifically looking for a replacement for the Boston 12

TLDR; Wow, this is by far the best ride I have ever had in a shoe. I specify ride cus the fit needs work, but wow I've never enjoyed running in a shoe this much.

**Runs so far:**

As I usually do with a new shoe, I did a 10km progression run with paces ranging from 6:00min to 4:00min splits. Next day did an easy 5km at recovery pace with my partner. And just finished a 15km run with 12km at tempo (4:45 split).

In general I plan on using this shoe for my tempo / threshold runs, and some long runs when I want to include a bit of speed.

**Ride:**

Amazing, incredible, I have no words. I mostly heel-strike, unless I‚Äôm doing speed work. The transition from heel to toe is incredibly smooth, and the toe-off is powerful. The shoe feels bouncy and fast due to the top layer of race foam, but the firmer training foam at the heel gives it a good sense of control. They‚Äôve mentioned the plate is mostly for stability, and I can definitely feel the foam is ‚Äúrestricted‚Äù to a certain area thanks to it, giving good (albeit not great) stability. But it also feels like it snaps back and propels you forward pretty well as well.

Maybe the only thing I would say is that the toe-off is ‚Äútoo powerful‚Äù, if that even counts as a negative. Running at a 6min split was actually difficult, I felt I was fighting the shoe, and my knees were feeling it. Honestly anything less than a 5:15 split (my ‚Äúnot) felt like I was fighting the shoe. It‚Äôs really meant to go at a good pace.

**Fit:**

This is where it struggles more. It‚Äôs a Hoka shoe so it fits snug. I personally like it, I don‚Äôt like having too much room in my shoe, doesn‚Äôt feel agile. Especially for a super-trainer such as this. Upper feels light and breathable, but not ‚Äúcheap‚Äù and rough like some other racing uppers for trainers (looking at you Boston 12).

Now for the heel-counter and heel fit altogether. It sucks. The reviews weren‚Äôt wrong, that‚Äôs why I made sure to try it out in a shoe-store first before buying it, and I would recommend that you do too. But I‚Äôll go a little bit more into details as to ‚Äúwhy‚Äù, at least for me.

The heel counter is very flimsy and provides very little support. To remediate that, Hoka put 2 ‚Äúpads‚Äù in the middle of the collar to squeeze around your achilles and avoid heel lift / slip. The thing is, it works. But your heel still WANTS to slip or lift, and whenever it does, you really feel those pads dig into the skin around your achilles to hold it in place. This creates what feels like rubbing or sliding, but I‚Äôve noticed it doesn‚Äôt actually cause any chafing or pain, it just feels weird. Which is still annoying, but I‚Äôll live with it if it means I can run on this amazing midsole.

**Final thoughts:**

Go try this out in a shoe store before you buy it, or make sure you have a good return policy. The heel fit may be a deal breaker for you. However, if it isn‚Äôt, then you‚Äôre in for an incredible ride. This isn‚Äôt just my favorite super-trainer on the market, it‚Äôs my favorite shoe.

Edit: Also, in case anyone was wondering, a runner's not did help the heel pad issue! Not completely removing it, but definitely helping.",2024-11-18 18:48:54+00:00,41,37
1gub6gh,PHRunners,I‚Äôve tried most ‚Äúrace day‚Äù shoes - ito masasabi ko as a slow runner,"Disclaimer - nowhere close ako sa elite runner. 

10k - 1:09 
5k - 32:15 
21k - 2:38

I‚Äôm a fat slow runner (210lbs) 

Sabi nila wag raw mag carbon plated shoes kung ganito lang pace, but I find it hard to race on regular shoes kulang sa ‚Äúpush‚Äù lalo na on longer distances. 

Since mahilig ako gumastos, share ko lang findings ko after trying almost all of them.

Adios Pro 3 

- one of the friendliest beginner plated shoes. Not sure if ‚Äúcarbon‚Äù siya pero alam ko may energy rods. 

You won‚Äôt really feel the plate here but good energy return. Fun shoes to use as di siya sobrang aggressive and demanding ng certain pace for it to be comfortable. 

Foam is responsive and comfortable enough to take it for longer runs (above 10k). 

Metaspeed Sky Paris 

- aggressive shoes na ramdam mo talaga plate if you‚Äôre a slow runner like me.

I ran a 10k on it and grabe ramdam mo yung fatigue sa legs after. Super responsive siya, and the plate is really there 

You can feel the boost sa speed at the expense of comfort. For a slow runner, wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. Ideally ang pace dito is under 6:00 para talaga maramdaman yung inooffer ng shoes 

Hoka Cielo X1 

- great shoe for slower paces. Super comfortable even if talagang babagal ka like 8:30 - 9:00 (which I tend to do sa climbs since yung race route sa clark is notorious for the climbs) 

Medyo unstable lang so have to get used to it bago gamitin sa race day pero comfort is the key selling point. Di ko ramdam msyado yung plate but I feel the energy return when picking up the pace 

Cloudboom Strike 

- one of my favorite shoes ever. Super comfortable and can really break PRs. 

Similar siya sa Adios Pro 3 pero mas may cushion feel siya that you‚Äôd be thankful for 16km onwards. I used it for a HM and super good siya to the point di nag fatigue legs ko even after the race 

Forgiving feel even for heavier runners as di mo ramdam yung foam 

Alphafly 3 

- skip if not running at a solid pace imo. 

The pods feel weird and the foam can get unstable too. Running on 7 pace ramdam mo pa yung stiffness ng shoes but if you pick it up sa 5:30 under dun siya talaga nag shishine as a great shoe 

Siya rin least durable sa list. After 21km kita mo na agad damages sa foam ng shoes (forefoot striker btw) 

Vaporfly 3 

- comfortable and fast

Problem lang talaga is medyo weird yung snugness sa mid foot area so expect na poking sjya sa arches. 

Okay siya at any pace pero just like the alphafly pinaka masarap siya gamitin for faster paces. 

Durability is an issue rin. 

NB Supercomp Elite V4 

- similar to Hoka Cielo. Super comfortable shoe to use for beginners. 

Very forgiving ride and can pick up the pace rin. It‚Äôs a little less aggressive than the hoka cielo and focus niya talaga is comfort. Responsive rin naman but lacking compared to the others. 

Yun lang guys! Experience ko lang to so people might have different opinions and thoughts pero naisip ko ishare in case may katulad ko na nag babalak mag ‚Äúinvest‚Äù sa carbon plated race day shoes.

1gtvdar,PlantarFasciitis,"Getting a lot of mixed advice. Need something for flat feet and painful plantar fasciitis, but my podiatrist told me to go for something more rigid as opposed to all the plush HOKAs I've been getting.","I swapped exclusively to wearing plush HOKAs maybe 3 or 4 years ago which seriously cured my chronic lower back pain. I would have to see a chiropractor once or twice a month and I've since been chiropractor free. Additionally it had cured the destruction I'd feel after a full (no break) day with the family at Disneyland. Where before I'd have my lower back destroyed, legs on fire, and feet in pain, HOKAs made it so that I'd end the day with just some mild soreness from all the walking.

THAT BEING SAID. In the past few months I've been noticing my feet progressively getting worse with plantar fasciitis. The main is mostly in the inner midfoot and onward toward my heel. 

I recently saw my foot doctor and she told me I needed to swap over to something like Brooks Beasts because the plush cushions of HOKAs were actually not doing me any favors. I purchased those and some orthotics as well to wear in them.

Problem is they are ugly AF and I'm just wondering if there's anything better out there? I've been told to check out everything from New Balance 990s/2022Rs/Fresh Foams, Kuru, Nike Structure/React, changing up to HOKA Gaviota/Arahi, or Asics Kayanos/GT2000s.

1gsd6i5,PHRunners,BEST RACE DAY SHOE FOR MIDDLE PACKERS (HM and FM),"BEST SHOES FOR RACE DAY (MIDDLE PACKER)

Hi!

So I've been in the market for a good shoe for race day, as I'm preparing to join a 21k around Jan to Feb next year. My current race day shoes are the Takumi Sen 10s and while they are superb for 10k< , I don't think they'd be good in HM's or FM's. 

I'm just a middle packer, I run for the high of finishing, basically a ""happy to be here"" pace, ü§£ So I don't really need speed or to wring out even 1 second from my pace but I don't really want to compromise speed for comfort all that much . That being said, the Adios Pro 3 isn't an option for me. Right now I'm looking at the Hoka Cielo X1 Or the Asics Metaspeed Edge Paris. 

A lot of reviews give props to the Cielo X1 for keeping the runners safe in HM's or longer, but so does the MSE Paris albeit being lighter and snappier. Can someone please advise?

1gs6bsg,PlantarFasciitis,Hoka Bondi 8 Shoes UPDATE Review!,"Hi all 

I took many people's advice online about trying the Bondi 8 runners for moderate PF and a mild (but worsening at the time) bunion.

As you can see... I have USED these bad boys. 

I have zero regrets. Zero. 

In fact they've helped both of my issues so much I bought a second pair so I can wear them inside as my hardwood floors and bare feet do not get along. 

My life has changed. My knees feel better too. 


Now, a question. Has anyone got some great recommendations for winter boots (needs to handle Canadian winters of -30 to -40C some days). 

Needs to have a wide toe box for bunion issues. 

And arch support for PF. 

I'd love to hear your personal experiences

  If you were considering the Bondi Shoes I say worth the investment. 

I have had no pain or flare ups for about a year, and prior to these shoes I was in pain daily for almost 2 years.

1gpjb2a,XXRunning,Frustrated and unmotivated,"Hello! I‚Äôm 28 yr old female (163 cm and 52 kg) 
I started taking up running in january this year and I am ALWAYS dealing with shin splints (it‚Äôs always on the inside of my shins, it‚Äôs slightly worse in my right foot since it is a bit flatter but I wear insoles) 

I‚Äôm getting so tired and frustrated about not being able to increase my running distance at all or just in general not being able to run without feeling pain afterwards or even during 

What I‚Äôve tried: 

Different types of running shoes:
I‚Äôve tried Brooks, Nike, Asics, Hoka and Puma but no shoe seems to make a difference (also tried shoes with different heel drops) 

Strength training:
I‚Äôve always strength trained and a few months ago started focusing on doing calf strengthening workouts more often, tibialis raises and jumping off a box and landing on my toes (recommended by a physio therapist to try to get the shins used to the stress) 

Starting slowly running again:
Running 7x 2 min run 1 min walk and increasing that until I am running straight for 40 minutes (started doing that almost 3 months ago and it seems like a reasonable increase) and I never run two days in a row I always have one or two days in between

Cadence: 
I started taking smaller but faster strides and it does not seem to help but I‚Äôm going to keep running and aim for 175+ cadence 

Running form:
I am a bit of a heel striker but I‚Äôm working on landing a bit better on my midfoot but my physio therapist said that only played a small part in all of this 

Foam rolling and stretching:
Does not help one bit but I keep doing it either way

I really want some motivation that I will soon be in a place where I can run pain free but it just seems like it‚Äôs impossible! Surely the shins would have been able to get more used to running by now???

1gpevqm,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Mach 6 - 1500km review (over 2 pairs),"M 6ft2 87kg Mar: 2:58 HM1:26 

Recently hit around 1,500km in my Mach 6 journey (for reference first pair got to about 1,000km and second pair at just over 500km). I unfortunately don‚Äôt have my first pair anymore so the pictures are the second pair at 500km for reference. So my thoughts on the shoes for anyone considering them. 

So before anything, clearly I like this shoe. I‚Äôve had 2 pairs and will probably get a 3rd so for me they work. So will mostly be a positive review but there are some areas I don‚Äôt like them for so will discuss those as well. 

How I have used the shoe and what I feel they do well at: 
I have had 3 main uses for them. 
1) when I‚Äôm home my workout shoe and long run shoe. If I‚Äôm doing something a bit shorter like 10x1km I might go for an old race shoe but for works out that are longer (such as 4x5km at x pace) I will grab these. 
2) the Swiss Army knife shoe. I travel a lot for work so whenever I go if I just wanted to put on 1 pair of shoes and it be able to handle pretty much everything this will be it. 
3) non peak races. Have also used it for a few races that I‚Äôm not chasing a time as well as when helping pace a friend. Have done 3:10 Marathons all the way to 4:50 marathons in them so have handled a range of paces. 

There are a lot of reviews on them so won‚Äôt dive into the detail about them to much but in summary. Fit is normal Hoka size (half a size up from my normal size for me). Upper is not the most plush upper but found it comfortable with no blisters/hot spots/rubbing etc. midsole will chat about below and durability I think has been very good. 
Worth noting I tend to be very light on my shoes (in terms of visual wear) so my shoes tend to die in terms of midsole before they look beaten up. So not sure how others will cope but for me has been good. 

A bit more on the feel and how they last. In one sentence would say ‚Äúgood energy return with enough cushion for most runs while not being overly soft‚Äù. They tend to feel very soft when walking or standing in them but find they stiffen up a bit when running so you not sinking into them. How the midsole last. 
0-50km found they took about 50km just to settle in and find their sweet spot. Still bouncy and responsive during this time. 
50-500km the real sweet spot where they work best. 
500-1000km a general decline and start to loose their pop. Mine just got softer and softer so they never really hardened up (but did start to feel dead in longer runs on 20km plus). So take that as you will. 

What I did not like these for: 
- Recovery shoes - just not the type of shoe I would use. They fine but not the most comfortable so don‚Äôt slip them on and your feet are thanking you for the comfort (how I would like recovery shoe to be). 

- daily shoe: maybe a bit of a contra opinion here but I didn‚Äôt like using them for MY dairy runs. What I specifically mean by that is during a week about 3 to 4 runs are just easy, cruising at around a 5:30 (per kilometer) pace. Now they can certainly handle this fine but the shoes I like for this are pretty much the same as my recovery shoe. Specifically shoes that are extremely comfortable. But this is just for my runs, they can no doubt be a daily shoe if you looking for one. 

So who are they for? 
Well clearly first option is someone whose looking for exactly what I do and use them for. 
Otherwise if someone is looking for a ‚Äúdo it all shoe‚Äù or if you looking for a race shoe and don‚Äôt want to go carbon I think they worth looking at. 

Lastly if you considering them as a marathon or ultramarathon shoe I would just take note. They certainly fine and can do the job but for my height and weight I found they start to feel like they were bottoming out a bit once I hit the 30km plus mark. Wasn‚Äôt a massive issue and didn‚Äôt cause any pain but just felt that was about the upper end of where the pop felt like it was really thriving. But again I did a 56km ultra in them and they were fine but wouldn‚Äôt be my first choice again for this type of race.

Some alternative if you not wanting Hoka or want other options. Puma deviate nitro, Saucony speed series, NB Rebel, ASICS Superblast (never owned a Superblast but throwing it based on the hype around them). 

Happy to answer any questions!

1glar0y,PlantarFasciitis,New recommendations from a new doctor,"UPDATE!!!! 
Wanted to share my progress 3 weeks into my new regime. My goals with my doctor were twofold: reduction in daily pain, ideally with pain-free days. And being able to wear shoes other than goddamn running shoes. As mentioned in my first post, my doctor was confident I'll get there by the end of the year (yeah right...). Well, I have to eat my hat now. Between changing my shoes and using the Inflaflex cream I have SIGNIFICANT pain reduction. I am increasingly completely pain-free. I bought a pair of knee-high boots! I put some thick insoles in to keep cushioning but my feet are fine in them! I wore 3 inch heels today totally pain free!!! I can count on one hand the number of times I have worn something other than trainers in the last 3 years. 

So, I've basically reached my goal already. But still continuing with physio (I won't share the exercises because they are specific to me and my needs and specific weaknesses I have) and I'm hoping the strength I build through that allows for the pain reduction to continue once I'm no longer using the Inflaflex cream. But I really think that cream has massively helped with the positive turn I've taken. I really recommend asking your doctors about it, or something similar in your country.

Honestly I'm in disbelief. I've seen podiatrists and physios, it just took seeing the right doctor (he is a sports medicine doctor) to find an approach that works for me. If anyone here is also from Toronto, go see Dr Sayde at PushPounds.


#############

I've had PF for 6+ years, have worn custom orthotics pretty exclusively for the last 2+ years, done 15 rounds of shockwave therapy, some physio and massage, constant daily pain. So I saw a new doctor at a sports medicine clinic today and he's given me a totally different direction and feels really confident I'll have a lot of improvement within the next 8 weeks. I went to this appt planning to ask about invasive, last-resort options because that's where I felt I was, and he really feels I will not need anything like that.

He told me to throw out my hokas and custom orthotics. The orthotics are hard and the high arch support is actually increasing the pressure in my fascia where I have very localised pain. He told me to buy the most cushioned shoes I can. My hokas needed replacing anyway, so I've just bought some Skechers and already feel the pressure relief. He doesn't rate custom orthotics at all, which is interesting and does align with some stuff I've read about them. Previously a PT and podiatrist had emphasised arch support and ankle support. This doctor cares less about that and more about relieving the pressure on that point of pain.

He also recommended heel cups and just thick padded insoles in anything i wear, still with that focus on relieving the pressure on that point of my heel. Previously I was told always orthotics and running shoes, but this dr said I don't have to be that strict, just not a flat shoe (but obvs can get flare ups if I wear heels). He does still agree not to be barefoot. I wear oofos at home which I love.

He has also prescribed me a specific pain cream, InflaFlex. Spoke very highly of it, wants me to use it for 3 weeks, every 8 hours. Excited to try it. (May be exclusive to Canada or in other names elsewhere, not sure)

Also, physio. I'm back at the clinic on Friday to go through it all, but he's prescribing a specific range of physio to do for the next 8 weeks, 10 mins every day.

He also mentioned weight loss, which is something my body has never responded to easily, and I've had some dietary issues this year so I'm not sure about that right now, but he wasn't pushy on it. Just that some people see relief even with small amounts of weight loss.

It's not a dramatic approach at all, but I was really relieved by his confidence in seeing some recovery very quickly. The pain I have is bad, but extremely textbook, so I'm really excited to see some improvement. I know everyone is so different with PF, but I actually feel quite excited to hopefully get some relief! And maybe something here will be helpful to others. I hope to report back positively in a few weeks.",2024-11-06 22:14:52+00:00,13,12
1gl78hp,hiking,Gel insole recommendation for narrow trail shoes (Hoka Speedgoat),"Hi,

Does anyone have any recommendations for gel insoles that will fit Hoka Speedgoat 6s?

My ankles are rubbing against the sides and it's quite uncomfortable, but everything else about the shoes is great. So want to see if I can raise my foot a bit higher and thought gel insoles might be the way to go.

However, because Hoka's are narrow I don't want to get anything that's going to curl or crumple at the sides.

1gkfifu,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Cielo X1 Compared to Alphafly 3,"https://preview.redd.it/yzo8svsh05zd1.jpg?width=968&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cad65c6fe50cb0786812564123ff7ab8230c179b

Photo:  Alphafly 3 and Hoka Cielo X1 Comparison

About Me:¬† 6' 185lbs, Late 40's, 1:30 HM, 3:15 FM, Midfoot Striker, 50 miles per week.¬† Easy pace: 8:00, Tempo: 6:45 - 7:00/mile, All Out/Threshold: 5:40-6:30/mile

CURRENT MILAGE- Hoka Cielo X1 (150 miles), Alphafly 3 (30 miles)

**OVERVIEW-** I wanted compare and contrast two of the more expensive supershoes for anyone on the fence.¬† I ran a recent marathon choosing the Alphafly 3 but this review may help you if you are deciding between the 2.¬† Both are worthy of being a raceday choice.¬†

***(UPPER & FIT) CIELO X1*** \- The Cielo X1 has a similar step in feel as the Alpha Fly, although the upper is built up a bit more.¬† The material has a kind of scratchy plastic feel that I think will hold up beautifully over time.¬† I did change the laces on the Cielo X1 to Vaporfly laces as they plasticky stock one's were a little fiddly, although effective.¬† I wanted a more traditional lace.¬† Easy $4.00 spent.¬† I went up TTS (11.5) size on the Cielo and find it to be perfect for my foot.¬† Plenty of breathability and wiggle room for my toes.

**UPPER & FIT (*****ALPHAFLY 3*****)-** The Alphafly 3 upper is probably has the best upper in the game.¬† Lightweight, breathable, easy to slip your foot into.¬† The laces are awesome, and achieving a lockdown is easy.¬† In terms of sizing, I'm one of those odd folks who is legit in between two sizes.¬† Since the 11.5 was sold out, I opted for my mens 11.¬† In terms of fit, I did get a bit of jamming on my left toe on my initial run which caused me some pain.¬† Switching to a thinner sock seems to have alleviated the issue.¬† During the Long Beach Marathon, all was fine until about mile 20 when both my big toes were seriously throbbing.  I lost both toe nails a few days after the race (gross!).  With the new drops, I returned the size 11 and received an 11.5.  Nike has an amazing return policy!

Lesson learned:  Wait for the right size and/or always size up if you're in between.

**MIDSOLE & RIDE** ***(CIELO X1)***:¬† The Hoka Cielo X1 is Buh-buh-buh-bouncy!¬† The ride underfoot is considerably softer, yet propulsive compared to the AF3.  It feels like the stack is higher and more protective.  Hoka I think uses some wizardry to get around the 40mm legal standards similar to other brands like Mazuno.¬† It gets knocked by reviewers as being too heavy or bulky, but the sensation on foot is oh so nice.¬† The rocker geometry along with the bouncy PEBA foam makes toe offs and transitions smooth and effortless.¬† The Cielo isn't the fastest racer out there, but it can easily pick up the speed for me in terms of threshold (5:40 ish pace).¬† It's also a very pleasant shoe at slower paces.¬† I've used this shoe quite extensively for recovery days and long-runs.¬† I've done multiple 20 milers in the shoe and have never had an issue with fit, or recovery (sore feet, tired legs etc) aside from normal muscle fatigue.¬† I love it so much I grabbed a second pair so when these are done, I'll have another in the locker. ¬†

**MIDSOLE & RIDE** ***(ALPHAFLY 3)***: The Nike Alphafly 3 has a very similar ride as the Cielo X1, albiet a bit more mechanical and effecient.¬† In my first initial runs I was shocked at how little effort I was putting into my runs and how efficient they were at tempo (7:30/mile and faster).¬† It almost felt like I was barely jogging at 8min/mile paces in terms of heart rate when trying on different paces.¬† The AF3 is surprisingly supple and squashy. ¬† Once I figured out how to get the most of the mechanics of the shoe (landing/toe off of the pods), it really came alive.¬† You do however ""feel"" the tech in the shoe, and it does take some mild getting used to.¬† The ride is also quite rigid when moving laterally, and I noticed that cornering can stress my feet a bit on sharp turns or stepping into cambered terrain (grass, jumping on/off curbs etc).¬† It's more of a straight line running shoe vs. a nimble racer or trainer. ¬†I prefer the overral ride of the Cielo X1, but the AF3 is honestly a tad faster/more efficient over long distances.¬† If you aren't running faster than 7:30 min/miles, I don't see the AF3 being of much benefit to you.

**DURABILITY** ***(CIELO X1)***:¬† The Cielo X1 is extremely durable!¬† At 150 miles, there is very little wear to the outsole.¬† The upper material is very easy to wash.¬† The exposed foam on the bottom also has little to no wear aside from some basic discoloration.¬† The midsole and bounce are exactly as if they were brand new.¬† I hope that Hoka continues this trend as they are notorious for durability issues with their non-peba/basic EVA blends. ¬†

**DURABILITY** ***(ALPHA FLY 3)***: So far, so good!¬† I have seen varying reviews from folks that both praise and trash AF3 durability.¬† As a midfoot striker, I've seen no wear at all on the rear or exposed areas.¬† The outsole seems like it's¬† relatively durable.¬† I can see this shoe going at least a few hundred miles before either losing bounce or having the outsole begin to heavily deteriorate.¬† That being said, most reviews say the shoe isn't designed for anything aside from tempo training and/or specifically racing.¬† I'll likely be using these a bit more gently than the Cielo X1's as the cost is so high. ¬†

**OVERALL RECOMMENDATIONS:**¬† As both of these shoes are extremely expensive, I'd say it really comes down to what you want.¬† I personally went with the AF3 for my race, but will use the CX1 for more miles and training. CX1 is soft, forgiving, and can work at all paces.  It also has higher durability.  The AF3 is a FAST shoe with a squashy midsole that offers a lot of return.¬† It's businesslike in its approach vs. the Cielo X1 which has the fun factor.¬† At roughly the same cost ($275/$285) I do feel like the Cielo X1 is going to be the better option for MOST people.¬† It excels at all paces, has high durability, and is truly one of the most fun shoes you can buy.¬† It's a great race day option that will also go the distance when it comes to long run/everday training.¬† The AF3 is a beast of a shoe that really excels at faster paces, has a soft yet mechanical feel, and will be the faster option for those of you looking for a sub 3:30 marathon. ¬†",2024-11-05 19:48:37+00:00,85,24

1gk8frx,sesamoid,Why do 95 percent of shoes hurt? ,"So over the course of this year I've tried about 30 different pairs of all types of shoes in extra wide versions. 95% of these shoes instantly put pressure on my sesamoids. Sometimes it gets better when I put my orthotics in, sometimes it even gets worse. 
A few shoes were pretty great with close to no irritation, but I still don't understand why they are better than the other shoes. 
I wonder if anyone ever figured out which shoes work and which don't. 
Hoka and Brooks which are often recommended are downright terrible for me. If I walk around in them for one minute both of my sesamoids are irrated a lot more than walking barefoot for 15 minutes. ",2024-11-05 14:51:13+00:00,7,39

1gjmkka,hiking,Hiking boot comparison Hoka Haka 2 gtx vs Altra Lone Peak ALL-WTHR 2 gtx,"So, some context.

I'm in my 30s, I've been hiking for a while and I ended up using Altra Lone Peak trail runners for some years now on my hikes. After that, I even changed my everyday shoes to Altra Torin 7 for my everyday shoes.

Apparently through the year my feet have learned to love the altras since they fit since day one and they never caused me injuries, blisters or anything bad so far.

This week I had to hike on a place that cold and vegetation was an issue, so I wanted boots instead of my runners, I dusted off my old boots and just from wearing them my feet were screaming for me to take them off. Even from a small hike I got a blister at the front of my toes.

So I'm in the market to buy boots now.

From my search in the last week I've ended up that I want to either go with the hype and try the Hoka Kaha 2 GTX or go with the ones that haven't betrayed me so far and try the boot version of Altra Lone Peak in the form of the ALL-WTHR 2 gtx version.

The hokas look like they are wide enough even they are not wide modelled so that's not a concern. The drop is not that much, even if not zero drop like the altras that I'm so used to apparently.

So I'm trying to figure out which ones would make a more comfortable shoe. I don't mind the durability that much, with my use when they finally wear out I'm never mad about it and I know that I'm buying lightweight shoes, so I'm not expecting a lifetime of a shoe.

I've read gearlabs and I've seen Rose Anvil's take on the Kahas since he doesn't have a video on lone peaks but only on timps that I don't think I'll enjoy.

But I'd like to hear your experience, especially if you have any similar experiences.

It was very nice for a week or 2, but then the pain came back. I heard that too much cushioned will only make PF worsen, so I looked for more options and narrowed it down to 2 pairs of shoes: Brooks Ghost Max, or the Max 2, and Asics Gel Kayano 31. There is not much information about these shoes and PF, but Brooks website did recommend Brooks Ghost Max for PF, though I'm not sure if it would work.

1gguinl,RunningShoeGeeks,Nike Zoom Fly 6 Initial Run,"
I was lucky enough to get a pair of the Zoom Fly 6s from a local running shop and had my first run with them today. I've been currently running in a rotation of Zoom Fly 5, Vaporfly 3, and Hoka Mach 5 (treadmill only) for the better part of the past year and wanted to give the comparison impressions between the 5 and the 6.

I'm 6'1'', 190lbs, and a mid-forefoot striker for what it matters. Fit feels exactly the same to me as the 5 and you can definitely tell right away when you put the 6's on they are a different shoe than the 5 - way more bounce and softness to the shoe just even standing in place. I will say that each pair of ZF5's I had all acted differently - some softer, some harder, all likely due to the recycled zoomx. The 6 exhibits none of this and feels like a much taller VF3 off the bat.

My initial run was supposed to be a simple Z2 4-5mile run but that quickly got shot down from the start of the run - these things want to move! They feel very similar to the VF3 in that they want you to up the pace a lot more than the ZF5 ever did. They feel much lighter on your foot and the energy return is greater as well - I felt like I was being propelled the way my VF3s do as well, just not quite as much pop as the VF3 though. Stack height is a little higher which initially made me feel weary of corners, but they remained planted for me as I made turns. Grip felt the same as the VF3 (which to me is a good thing) as I ran over grass, leaves, pavement, etc. Also, bonus points for being quieter than the ZF5.

Having lost my initial pace to start, I figured I would just try some difference paces out and the shoes responded extremely well to tempo, threshold, sprints, etc. I still found it hard to keep them in the slower paces but its also new shoe day so maybe a few more runs and the excitement will die down and I can focus on pace more.

I don't have experience with the older ZF line as I was a Newton runner up until maybe 2 years ago or so but I will say these have been the most fun I've had in a shoe next to the VF3. I tried the Boston 12, the Hoka Carbon X3, the Mach X, and probably a few others and at the time nothing else felt 'great' compared to the ZF5 for me and the ZF6 totally blows the ZF5 out of the water.

Hopefully Nike can convert some people back because I think they did a great job here.

1ggso6j,RunningShoeGeeks,Frustrated by brands not making premium shoes in a size 14 (and bigger),"A weird trend is emerging amongst some shoe retailers where they've stopped making their premium models (racers and super trainers) in sizes bigger than a US men's 13. ASICS is the standout example - the Metaspeed Edge+ and Sky+ both went up to a 14 (and in some colours a 15), but the Metaspeed Edge Paris and Sky Paris stop at a 13. The Superblast (versions 1 and 2) also stops at a 13, as does their new trail supershoe (the Metafuji Trail).

This might be an Australia-specific issue as I believe these brands sell 14s and 15s in the US, but I've also had trouble getting bigger than a 13 in Adidas shoes (Adios Pro 3 and 4, Adizero Evo SL, Prime X, and Terrex Agravic Speed Ultra) and Puma (Deviate Nitro Elite 3). Even Nike has only had two colours of Alphafly 3 (Proto and Volt) go past a 13, with several other colourways stopping at a 11 or 12.

Hoka, On, Saucony, New Balance and Nike for the most part produce 14s and 15s so it's not the end of the world, but it is frustrating and it's a trend I hope doesn't catch on. 

Does anyone with more insight into the industry know why 13/14 seems to be a somewhat common cut-off? Is there something about manufacturing or packaging that makes this a logical point to stop to maximise profits?",2024-10-31 23:58:05+00:00,32,43

1gfcpqc,PlantarFasciitis,Worried I may have plantar fasciitis.. ,"Hi Everyone, training for my first marathon and am running into a foot issue (28, male). Looking it up it appears to be plantar fasciitis but I can't be sure. It's basically the middle/middle outside of my left foot (bottom). Mostly a nuisance, sometimes painful. From reading posts in this thread, it seems I may have it and an early stage. 


Have never experienced foot problems until a few weeks ago. My Hokas got beat and I resulted back to a pair of Brooks that have a different incline and I never liked. I'm pretty sure that was the root cause, or from overtraining. What's weird is I can take several ibuprofen, on a few days rest, and rip plenty of miles with no pain (or at least subtle discomfort once | get ~8-10 miles in). And when I'm not running I don't notice it much.
From a training perspective.. I've kept a steady base of 25mi a week consistently. Race is 6 weeks away and l've started to climb (27mi last week, goal of 32 this week, up and up, taper, race). But I'm worried about damaging the foot more by not resting it. Ive run a few half marathons (fastest being just under 2hrs), and ran 13 on it yesterday. It didn't hurt much during but today it killed until I stretched and rolled it out.


Another thought, I do train with a buddy who is in better shape. We do our long runs together on mondays and push pretty hard. Yesterday, during the 13, we were pacing right at 8:45 per mile. With a goal of 15 l started to cramp on mile 10.. and felt I fueled pretty damn good throughout the day + during the run (multiple Gus, 500mg sodium, 30oz water...). I'm wondering if I'm potentially pacing + fast for my training. My goal is 4-4:15 so nothing crazy. 


Thoughts on the foot? Is this something I could continue to train on or cautious and rest? More importantly, can I continue to run while rehabbing, stretching and strengthening the calf / Achilles etc and continue on? I do not want to lapse in my training or forego the race‚Ä¶

Thank you!",2024-10-30 02:45:44+00:00,2,4

1gf1zw9,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka skyflow after 100 miles ,"M 24 5k pb:19:10  10k pb:38:38 

Not being a fan of hoka's standard daily trainer's the clifton and the bondi when I heard that the skyflow was releasing and that it was gonna have the supercritical Eva foam I was hyped so I went and bought it. Here are my thoughts after 100 miles:

Upper: The upper is the typical engineered mesh you find on the clifton as well and it's quite breathable and comfortable. No complaints here.

Fit: Regarding the fit I went true to size with this one and it fits really well. Bare in mind though the shoe is on the narrow side and if you have not tried a hoka shoe before you will probably need to go half or a full size up compared to brands like Nike for example.

The ride: Ngl at first the shoe felt quite weird. What I mean by that is that the foam in the heel did not match up well with the rest of the foam in the forefoot that's why I did not share my initial thoughts because I thought that the show needed some breaking in first.Let me tell you whe I hit 30 miles with these ( 50 km) they came back from the dead. The ride felt really incredible for a daily trainer. The shoe was responsive had some bounce not too soft not too firm either( although it's on the firmer side if you want to be nitpicking) and I was cruising with this in my typical 7:25-7:35 per mile pace for everyday runs. Also the shoe has enough protection to take you into the long distance as well. Also some people could even do somw strides with these with no problem although the weight might hold them back a bit.

Outsole: As you can see from the 2nd picture the outsole still holds up really well and think this will be way more durable than the bondi and clifton. This new generation of hoka shoes in general has improved in the durability department for sure( maybe the Rincon is the only exception) 

All in all I think the Hoka skyflow is a great daily trainer for anyone that's looking for a daily workhorse to do most of their miles that's also a bit more responsive and fun than your typical daily trainers. If anyone with wide feet wants to get these I would suggest going with the wide version if they can find it. Also I would not suggest to anyone that's looking for a lightweight daily trainer. You could go for the  Mach 6 instead. ",2024-10-29 18:40:17+00:00,49,21
1geytbj,PlantarFasciitis,My shoes feel like I‚Äôm climbing a hill ,"Especially after new insanely rigid orthotics. The feel like I have flat, hard snowshoes on, or skis. I am walking funny, extremely slow because I can‚Äôt get any momentum. 

I‚Äôm talking about Hoka Clifton‚Äôs and Brooks Glycerin 21. I think it‚Äôs because the soles are not rounded ( not rockers ). I have to do all the work with the ball of my foot to push against the hard ground. I tried to get used to them slowly, and it was easier with my foam orthotics. I used to wear highly cushioned Nike Zoomx Invincibke Run 2. Now they‚Äôre out of production  and they are so worn it‚Äôs actually hurting me badly. 

I get hurt from cushioning pushing against my foot. I find relief with harder flat soles!! But isn‚Äôt that what causes PF? And how do I gain momentum? I put in so much work to actually walk! My ankles and calves hurt. Even the big toes hurt 

All this AFTER steroid shots in both feet. I‚Äôve been recovering ok at home but my PF comes back worse and worse any work day ( literally only 2 days a week) In any shoe and it‚Äôs a sedentary office job.

1gedng5,RunningShoeGeeks,Asics Superblast 2 & Metaskeed Sky+ ,"Hi,

I am currently training to run the Singapore Half marathon on December 1st.

I am 31 years old, 6'1"" tall and weigh around 77kg (\~170lb).

Over the past 2 months I bought three new pairs of Asics shoes (please don't judge): and I'll go into the reasoning for a bit here and share my experiences with you.

* Superblast 2
* Metaspeed Sky+
* Metaspeed Sky Paris

This post mainly focuses on the SB2 and the MS+.

# Background and SB2

I needed a new daily trainer, and replaced my trusty Hoka Mach 6 after around 800km (500miles).

I got sucked into the Superblast hype and couldn't resist to try it out. I now have around 250km on them and I am pretty happy, if not fully satisfied. Initially, the shoe was pretty stiff, but after 100km it got sufficiently soft and comfortable to use them as a daily trainer.

The Superblast was supposed to be my workhorse for everything. I'd use them for tempos, intervals, long runs and even recovery runs. They actually did the job well, but they only really exceeded for me in being a good daily trainer and long run shoe. Last Sunday, I also took them for a spin on a long run with some half marathon tempo sections. While they certainly were not perfect and noticably slower than my Metaspeed Sky+, they were responsive enough that I'd use them again in the next tempo sessions. Super comfortable ride, a good upper and it looks amazing. I'd say this shoe has been well worth the 220‚Ç¨ price tag for me, even if it was just too clunky for my liking when doing intervals. I am currently planning on replacing them with another pair of SB2 once they hit their EOL.

My only ""critique"" would be that they are definitely no shoe I enjoy using on recovery days. These shoes really feel best when my legs are fresh, and in this case, they can actually be used for almost everything in my opinion. However, depending on how I will perceive the training load in the future, I might look out specifically for a shoe for recovery days.

# Metaspeed Sky+

So, after the first runs I was so convinced of the Superblast 2s that I also considered switching up my racing shoes for the upcoming half marathon in December to Asics' offerings. I was initially planning on running a half marathon in Munich wih my Cielo X1s with 150km on them, but got sick two weeks before and by 3 days out my resting heart rate still had not recovered enough to risk running the half marathon, especially because I knew that I'd still go full send despite being still a bit sick.

With Munich skipped, I now had 8 weeks to the Singapore half, which means I'd also have some weeks to get used to a potential new racing shoe. I ran the Vienna Half in April in my Hoka Cielo X1s, but they give my terrible blisters and chafings below my ankles. I don't blame the shoes, but I think my feet are just not well formed for the Cielos. I'll still use them but only with heavily bandaged feet and for occasional long runs/tempos with little switch up in speeds.

So, I was on the lookout for the Metaspeed Sky Paris. However, as you can imagine, actually finding a pair in your size can be pretty complicated, especially because I was initially looking for the orange colorway. I spend most of October looking for them, to no avail.

I then took a short trip to Italy, and due to bad weather, found myself in an Asics Outlet next to Lake Garda. I was just planning on maybe looking for discounted Superblast 1s or Novablast 3s to have a cofortable trainer once my Superblast 2s reached their limit, but ended up stumbling upon Metaspeed Sky+ in Diva Pink and really loved the colorway and overall look of the shoe.

I have heard that these are way stiffer than the Sky Paris, so I gave them a go with the intent to use them for intervals and really fast sessions. I am also hoping for them to be usable for some 500kms, because the FF Turbo Foam seems to be pretty durable.  
With the 30% discount I bought them and have since then used them for interval sessions and heavier efforts. I also used them for one long run, where I was suprised by how comfortable they were. At the same time, they are quite different from what I was used to from the Cielo X1s.

The Cielo X1 is extremely bouncy and ""jumpy"", whereas the Metaspeek Sky+ just made me run fast without giving me the feeling of actually being bouncy. It is very weird and hard to describe, but I actually really fell in love with the shoes and how they feel, simply because they are extremely direct and fast. One thing I also love is the upper of the Metaspeed Sky+. Extremely breathable and very comfortable. The outsole seems like it has not a lot of durability, butwe will see how it holds up. I am extremely curious how the foam will feel with more miles on the shoes.

One thing I immediately noticed is that they are very hard on my body and after a run I was considerably more exhausted than when I ran in my Superblast 2 or the Cielo X1s, but I also went significantly faster. This also was the reason why I only used them for one 17km long run. While the paces really go easy in these, they are also just very straining on my legs.

As with other carbon plated shoes, these really only show their strengths at faster paces and make it way easier for me to go from a marathon pace to a 10k pace, where I'd hit a wall pretty quickly with my SB2s in Over/Under HM pace workouts.

# Metaspeed Sky Paris

With me being extremely satisfied with the Metaspeed Sky+, I was even considering racing in them in Singapore, but - as you can imagine - the Metaspeed Sky Paris came back online in my size at my local store, and I bought them solely for racing in them and I will get used to them in the weeks prior to the next half marathon.

# Closing thoughts

One thing I can say is that the combination of a well worn in Superblast 2 and the Metaspeed Sky+ are currently the perfect fit for my training plan. I  usually have 2 quality sessions (tempo and intervals) per week + a long run and 2-3 recovery/simpler runs. I plan on using the Superblast 2 for the long runs, but might switch it up to the Metaspeed Sky+ for a race pace check 4 weeks out from Singapore half, to have some idea of how realistic my goal pace is, from where on out I'll use the Metaspeed Sky Paris for the long runs and the taper sessions in the week leading up to Singapore.

One thing I can say is that I definitely became an Asics guy over the last two months, lol. Quality has been top notch.

1gd5ass,walking,Toe Injury,"I started my walking journey from January this year, in order to lose weight and in an attempt to reverse diabetes that was diagnosed at that time. Started from small walks to now an average of 10 kms/day. Walked about 1300 kms this year. 

Bought a couple of good comfortable pairs of shoes (Hoka Bondi 8 and Brooks Ghost Max) to help support this good habit.

The walking along with a better diet has helped me lose weight from 120 kgs to 101 kgs. 

About 3 weeks ago, I had a toe injury. Not sure how it got caused, but the smallest toe has blackened. No pain. The doctor said there has been an haemorrage in the toe and has asked me to apply ointments and take a medicine to help the blood get absorbed. 

While it is getting visibly better, the diabetes is probably causing a very slow healing.

Meanwhile I am not supposed to go on my walks. This makes me feel miserable. Walking is the happy part of my life and I miss it. Not to mention the return of weight, due to immobility. 

Has anyone faced this? I hope I will be able to resume in a week or two, but I can't have this recur - hence looking for any advice or tips.",2024-10-27 07:05:42+00:00,1,2

I am planning on trekking through Kungsleden next august and was wondering if anyone had suggestions on pairs of shoes/boots that are appropriate for this terrain and could make the trip more enjoyable. From what I've read, I am leaning away from heavier leather boots that will get water logged, but also not going for a trail runner with zero water resistance, but somewhere in between the two. 

I'm also curious what are some things to look for besides material choices? Like the treads of the shoe, the type of lacing system, how tall the heel is, the durability and the overall comfort of the boot are things I would love to get some insight on.

1gbavdo,sesamoid,Sesamoid Fracture Success Story,"Hello- I have waited months to write this, for fear of ‚Äújinxing‚Äù things.  It would frankly be easier not to, but I feel I owe it to the many (hundreds? thousands?) of folks with newly-diagnosed sesamoid injuries who come here to say - you will recover and you will run/sprint again! While I feel terrible about those who are struggling with this injury, pls know that the vast majority of healthy people (particularly young athletes) who get this injury make a full recovery.  And no, it does not usually take 6-12 months.  While my heart goes out to those who are struggling, it does create a lopsided and traumatic picture for the newly-diagnosed.  Here‚Äôs my family member‚Äôs story (it is currently late October, for context)
-plays a field sport with a lot of running in tight cleats
- mild sesamoid pain beginning April, insisted that they liked their tight cleats. Running/sprinting at practices/games 2 hours/day 6 days/week through April/May
-early June, felt sudden increase in pain during game.  Continued playing for another hour.  Could not walk after game, had to remove shoes and limp to car.
-mid-June, took 4 Advil/day in order to keep playing in a tournament. Said running in (stiff) cleats ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt hurt‚Äù but all other sneakers hurt. So kept playing in cleats.
-late June, finally saw sports med doctor.  Painful to palpate the sesamoids, lots of swelling seen on in-office ultrasound. Doc said you need immediate rest, this is best case sesamoiditis, worst case stress fracture. No running and come back in a month.
-Did not stop running. Returns to doctor mid July. MRI shows possible stress fracture (disagreement amongst 2 radiologists). Local doc puts her in boot which she hates.
-immediately seek second opinion from orthopedic surgeon (foot) at major academic research hospital. He thinks it is ‚Äúprobably not‚Äù a stress fracture, and ‚Äúlikely‚Äù a bipartite sesamoid.  Regardless, pulled from sport for 6 weeks.  New doctor is very ‚Äúanti-boot‚Äù (even for broken sesamoid), insists on combination of Hokas + dancer pads. Says root cause was tight Achilles, orders immediate PT to work on ankle flexibility and range of motion.
-For 6 weeks (mid July-late August) wears Hokas plus dancer pad. No sports but intense cardio on spin bike (in Hokas) 3 x per week, weighlifting and PT 2 x per week to increase ankle flexibility.
-return to new doctor in Late August for follow-up CT scan. Receive the bad/shocking news that it is an actual fracture (2 pieces), not a bipartite sesamoid as originally thought on Xray. CT scan shows some early bone bridging but not healed yet. Told to come back in 5 weeks.
-same parameters (Hokas, intense cardio biking, PT for ankle flexibility) from late August-early October. Got custom orthotics with built in dancer pad which they loved.
-Early October- CT scan shows nearly complete bone healing/ossification!! This is approximately 12 weeks after treatment began. Approved to begin a return to sport progression. Has now successfully completed 4 full-length, full field practices with sprinting/pivoting with no pain (it is currently late October). Feels great, fast and strong. Will return for (hopefully) final x-ray and clearance to return to competition on November 1.
What do I think worked? Hokas & offloading (either dancer pad or custom orthotics); safe exercise on bike to push blood flow into the foot to increase circulation/healing; vitamin D supplement prescription; not using boot or cast; not running; good nutrition 
What did we not do? We did not do any of the icing/contrast bathing I read about here; no Advil following diagnosis; no exogen bone stim; no barefoot walking (except in shower, boat etc)
I hope this is helpful and provides some hope/comfort! ",2024-10-24 19:18:33+00:00,21,60
1gb6eds,PlantarFasciitis,Got a trip to New York in a week and heel pain won‚Äôt go away,"I‚Äôm just freaking frustrated and could use advice and honestly some comfort.

Have always had some foot pain but nothing extreme until last month. First week of September I wore some converse shoes out and towards the end of the night, had horrible pain in my right heel. Like an electric shock with each step. Took them off and the next day I could not even walk. Like I stayed in bed all day and when I had to go the bathroom I crawled. Horrible pain. It tapered off for a few days and I even went to see a podiatrist where he gave me a cortisol shot, some powerstep insoles, an anti inflammatory to take, and a night splint. He said I have plantar faciatus and these things should help. Okay cool.

It‚Äôs almost the end of October and this heel pain will not leave. It‚Äôs not like that first day but I cannot walk for too long or it comes back. None of my walking shoes feel good anymore. My hoka Clifton 9, my new balance 1080, brooks ghost 15. None are helping. I‚Äôve tried them with the insoles, without the insoles, the heel pain comes after a mile. On a good day I can two miles but then it comes. I‚Äôve done it all. Im doing stretches, calf raises, I‚Äôve rested a week, tried to slowly get into by doing a half mile. Then go to a mile. Nothing and I‚Äôm so frustrated. The only shoes that feel good are my oofo sandals and my slides. I can even do a 1/2 mile in my oofos faster than my regular shoes because it feels so good to walk without pain. But it‚Äôs a recovery shoe and I‚Äôm about to have to walk miles and miles in New York. 

I‚Äôve gone through this sub and I know this takes time. And luckily my heel pain isn‚Äôt all the time but I need to be able to walk for this trip. My fiance and I put a lot of time and money into this trip and we are going. And I can actually walk barefoot on my carpet with no pain. But I put on my shoes that have ample cushion, it comes back

And now, it‚Äôs like my heel hates any kind of restriction. I so much as put on my hokas, or my brooks, I can feel the heel pain coming back. Just putting on the damn shoe. But with sandals my heel is happy. No pain. Uggggg it so frustrating. 

Anyone experience this? Like heel pain is nonexistent then as soon as you put on your shoes you feel it? Any recommendation for cushy walking sandals I could wear in New York since for some reason my heel hates construction now?",2024-10-24 16:11:46+00:00,12,30
1gay1l4,PlantarFasciitis,Plantar fasciitis very slowly improving ,"Hi, just found this community. 
I developed PF in both feet after a really long beach walk in Ugg boots. I also don‚Äôt think it helped that I had been wearing cheap shoes for work. 
I hobbled for 7 months, left it too long really, but did eventually see a physio. She did 5 shockwaves, weeks of calf massage, showed me stretches. I rolled it on a ball. I stretched on the stairs. I bought gel insoles. I‚Äôve purchased really good trainers (Hoka and Brooks). I‚Äôve tried Chiropractor and now had 2 sports massages on whole legs - never known pain like it. 
It is really slowly easing. I think it‚Äôs time rather than anything I‚Äôve done! I am rather lazy with stretches!

1gadj4a,FootFunction,Question on 2nd MTP pain and capsulitis.,"Been battling what was diagnosed via ultrasound guided diagnostic injection as capsulitis back in February. Only lidocaine was used, no steroid. I‚Äôve been off-loading with a met. pad for about 7 months and have iced on and off in this time. I actually bought a shower chair as standing in shower was awful. The met pad in a sneaker is not comfortable so now I‚Äôm going to cut out the area under 2nd MTP in an insole for my Hokas. The pain has gone away however there still feels like there is a little pebble in foot when bearing weight. I asked Dr. if this could be scar tissue causing this feeling. We palpated for plantar plate tear and she did not think I had this. No cross-over toe either. I guess my question is can capsulitis leave scar tissue and how does one get rid of scar tissue. Does the body eventually absorb/replace the scar tissue? Or maybe the swelling from the capsulitis just hasn‚Äôt totally resolved. 

I‚Äôd like to add I am going to try Correct Toes and doing some stretching to loosen a definite calf muscle tightness issue. ",2024-10-23 15:36:25+00:00,1,4

After a podiatrist actually made my PF *worse* (can you believe it?!), I was battling this pain for over a year. I was desperate, so I started doing my own research. Someone on here mentioned Hoka ""Ora Recovery Slide 3"" in relation to walking on hardwood floors all day, saying they were a lifesaver for their foot pain. I figured I had nothing to lose.

Three months ago, I started wearing these slides religiously around the house. Seriously, I didn't take a single step on a bare floor unless I was in the shower. Within two weeks, the constant tightness in my calves vanished. It was amazing! Each month, I could feel my PF getting better. Now, after three months, I can honestly say I don't have horrible pain anymore. It used to consume my thoughts with every step, but now I can finally walk without the nagging pain.

I know everyone's different, and what works for me might not work for everyone. But honestly, these slides are the **only** thing that's made a real difference for me. I was exhausted, trying everything I could find, and starting to think surgery was my only option.

Now, I can be on my feet all day (in regular shoes), and while I might feel a little ache here and there, it's nothing compared to the agony I used to be in. I'm not going to say my PF is 100% cured, but it's gotta be at least 90% better. I can live with that! Maybe the next 3 months I will be at 100%? Hope this helps.",2024-10-23 01:41:34+00:00,34,15

1g8b75o,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Cielo Road - 85.5 Mile (137.7 km) Review. ,"https://preview.redd.it/2vuw3n4lczvd1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47f89aedbcd3889da50c6dc3ef0c113de24933c0

Hey RunnningShoeGeeks,

I haven't seen too many notes about the Cielo Road on this subreddit (understandably) so I figured I would post my experience with the shoe. 

**About me:** 175cm (5' 9""), 72kg (\~160 Lbs), hobby jogger that averages about 60-75 miles a week (96-120km) per week. Foot strike varies from rear mid-foot to forward heel (depending on pace).



**How I have used this shoe?** 

The Cielo Road has been used mostly as an interval/speed work shoe for me, on both tarmac and track, but I have also used it on some mild trails and for daily runs. I purchased it for $99 from a local running store that was clearing out a sale sample because I wanted something plateless that would help encourage adaptation for workouts. Despite belonging to the 5k/10k racer category, I have taken this shoe on a 14.2 mile (22.9 km) long tempo effort without issue and find that it could absolutely be utilized for a full marathon by the right individual. In fact, if we weren't in the maximal high-stack super-shoe era and jumped back ten years, I have a strong feeling this would be talked about as **the** premier marathon racing shoe. 



**Fit/Upper:** 

The Cielo Road fits akin to other shoes in the 5k/10k racing category: it is quite snug, narrow, and hugs the heel/midfoot very well. I had zero issues with heel slippage the upper does a great job of holding you down to the platform, especially when picking up the pace. Personally, I find that it has much more room in the toe box compared to other shoes in the same category (Takumi Sen 10/Saucony Sinister - both of which I have tried), providing a bit more length and volume. As is normal with other Hoka (or racing) shoes, if you need a wide size this is likely not the shoe for you. It does have a fairly narrow midfoot and the upper does not stretch much at all. Breathability is not an issue with the shoe in anyway, as the upper is made from very light mesh with minimal internal structure elements. The tongue is not gusseted and has no padding of any kind, as is normal with a race shoe. 



**Performance:**

While the shoe is marketed as a plateless 5k/10k racer, I find that it really excels at any pace (or terrain) that gets thrown at it. I've ran everything from easy paces (8:14 min/mile \[5:07 min/km\]) down to mile PR paces (4:50 min/mile \[3:00 min/km\]) and the shoe has performed flawlessly at all of it. The ride of the shoe isn't overly prescriptive in any way, despite having a small amount of later-stage rocker, and the platform has a great balance between stiffness and flexibility which makes it very versatile. The 100% PEBA midsole used in the Cielo Road is unlike any other I have found in the market; it is uniquely firm and bouncy, but not harsh in any way. With each stride the shoe returns a fair amount of energy from the midsole which helps ""cushion"" a lot of the blow from harder efforts; though, it doesn't compare to the energy return of a carbon-plated trainer. It is also quite a stable platform for a 5k/10k racer, which allows it to go for longer distances with ease. I've had no issues at all with any medial arch pain, which has occurred with other shoes in this segment (Takumi Sen 10). 

The only knock in the performance I can give it is that the outsole does not have great grip on wet asphalt or roads. It definitely isn't anywhere near as bad as Hoka's general training line (Clifton, Rincon) and is far better than what Saucony uses on their shoes (especially the ES4). 



**Durability:** 

The Cielo Road, for a 5k/10k racer, has been a surprisingly durable shoe. The exposed midsole has minimal wear after 85 miles and there is no visible fatigue on the outsole. I would expect that this shoe will last well into the 250+ mile range. 



**Overall Thoughts:** 

This is a great shoe that I think could easily be used as a daily trainer of the upper was more training oriented. It currently holds a few of my PRs (400m, 800m, 5k) and is a great implementation of super-foam in a lightweight, plateless, package.

1g866lm,Sneakers,Searching for my Holy Grail white sneaker,"I am looking for perfect white sneaker. I am a fashion forward, middle-aged woman who loves wearing chunky all-white trainers all the time, but especially with dresses and skirts. 

I'm looking for something
- all-white or nearly all white
- fairly chunky (think Hoka level chunk) and
- with a shapely figure-8 sole where the ball of the foot and heel of the foot are tapered and distinct.

This last point is very hard to describe, but I think the place where most trainers fail.  I loathe the flat, untapered sole of a Air Force 1s or old school New Balance and Adidas. I like a distinct toe box and heel.

In the past I've worn Fila disruptors, but feel that they're a little too chunky and young to keep with my current style. I currently where Hoka Bondis, but I'm not a huge fan of the mesh upper, which is impossible to keep clean.

I'm including a photo of a Fabletics shoe that looks pretty close to what I want, actually. Maybe I should just buy it, but I'm a little wary of buying from a non shoe brand.

But now, six months in, I love them! I do a variety of runs‚Äîshort, long, on-road, and off-road‚Äîand these shoes have proven to be very versatile. On the road, I appreciate how they cushion my landings and provide great control toward the front of the sole. They‚Äôre perfect for both short sprints and long, fast-paced runs. Off-road, their wide design helps prevent me from sinking too much into sand or mud (though they definitely don‚Äôt look as clean as they did in the picture anymore, haha).

Overall, they‚Äôre a great all-around shoe for different types of runs. However, if you‚Äôre really focused on a specific type of running, you might be better off with a more specialized shoe.

1g6caa2,trailrunning,Have Salomon trail running shoes declined in quality?,"Hey everyone, hope you're having a fantastic day.

I am coming up with that question because of two poor recent experiences with Salomon trail running shoes. I have worn a lot of Salomon shoes in my life, mostly XA Pro 3D models. In the last few years, I have started also using them for running, mostly on trails that are not too technical. I have worn out a first pair of XA Pro 3D during the first half of the year, using them mostly for running but also for the occasional hiking. I had the feeling that they had worn out faster than usual.

Since the XA Pro 3D are marketed as a hiking/trail running hybrid, I decided to go for the Sense Ride 5 (marketed as a can-do-it-all trail running shoe) as my new pair, and use them exclusively for running. I have used Strava to measure their mileage rigorously. By now, only 3 months in, they are completely worn out already, after running only 550km / 340 miles with them. Their grip is gone and running on humid, technical terrain is super slippery, the cushioning has mostly disappeared and they have lost most of their dynamism. Since my last run, I am suffering from feet pain, despite my training load having remained more or less constant in those 3 months.

It is very surprising to me. As a very light runner (60kg / 130lbs) who is running mostly on soft terrain, I would have expected my running shoes to last longer, closer to 800km / 500 miles, which usually is the maximum of the recommended range for a running shoe.

Are you also experiencing issues with more recent Salomon shoes or am I missing something? What alternatives do you recommend? I have heard some good about Hokas, and I see that for example the Speedgoat uses real Vibram soles.",2024-10-18 07:11:47+00:00,10,24

1g5v8kx,hiking,"Any recommendations for a lightweight, grippy, quick drying trail shoe?","Hi,

Last year, I did the first 4 days of the Camino de Santiago (Frances route), and met a lovely 73-year-old hiker who just seemed to glide across the trail! I asked what footwear she wore, and she said she favoured trail running shoes over traditional hiking shoes / boots, because of their springiness. She also favoured a quick drying shoe, over something waterproof, the logic being that if your feet are going to get wet anyway, it's better to have something with a light mesh that will dry overnight, than something that holds onto water for days. I like this thinking, and I want in! 

So I'm looking for a trail shoe, that is:

- Lightweight
- Springy and comfortable, without sacrificing too much durability
- Has a grippy soul
- Is quick drying

I've been perusing options for literally months, looking mainly at the Hoka and Altra ranges, and also wondering if Skechers would be durable enough.

There are so many variations and opinions out there though, so wondered what people's opinions are on this board?

Very grateful for any suggestions.

Comfort and ride: the step in comfort is great, I prefer a firmer shoe and these are stiffer than the all my other hoka except maybe the arahi. Soft shoes give me 5th metatarsal pain and these feel like a winner with the high stack and stiff foam. I ran a quick mile around the hotel and the energy return is awesome, almost like my superblast but with a much nicer, more relaxed ride. 

Conclusion: I think these are going to be great daily shoes that I can forget about on foot and just get through the miles. I‚Äôve been so caught up in fancy foams and plates that I‚Äôm missing a shoe that just disappears on foot and simplifies the run. ",2024-10-17 08:15:23+00:00,47,34

1g5gg91,Marathon_Training,First (official) marathon; what next?,"I ran my first marathon race two weekends ago (Twin Cities) and had a blast!  Crowd was great and everything clicked that day.  Most metrics were estimating my time to be between 3:35-3:45.  My goal was sub 3:40, and anything close to 3:35 would be best case.  Exercise backstory incoming-

I had been exercising pretty regularly since December 2018, but mainly stationary biking.  Long story short, I kept up on biking and occasional treadmill runs between end of 2018 and spring 2023, but had not done any outdoor running.  I worked out a lot in 2022, but I started gaining back some weight from a poor diet.  Went sober for the first 40 days of 2023 and adjusted my diet, which resulted in losing 30 lbs in two months and getting back to low 160's weight.  I decided to sign up for the marathon and started outdoor running that spring.  I wanted to see where my running endurance stood off the bat and my first outdoor run was 13.1 miles.  I was happy enough with the time (1:47.xx) and thought a marathon was doable, so I signed up.

Over the next few months I alternated between spin bike rides and outdoor runs, but there was no structure.  I kept trying to PR on runs of 6, 8, and 10 miles.  I was happy with the times but had no clue how that would translate to longer runs.  Based on this, I was going to do a 12 week program for marathon training.  Cut to the schedule conflict right about when I was going to start training and I gave 26.2 a shot a couple weeks later.  I had two goals - sub 4 hour and no walking.  Another long story short, I came out a little hot and my splits started declining around mile 16, hit a wall and walked from 23.35 to 24.2, then slowly jogged to the end to finish at 3:57:58.  My legs felt like garbage for a few hours but by late afternoon I felt better.

For this year's marathon, I knew I needed to take it more seriously.  I signed up for a 16 week plan with Runna.  I did all the workouts through week 7 or 8, than got a (self diagnosed) peroneal tendon issue.  I took two weeks off running and focused on icing/Ibuprofen, but substituted the runs with similar length/intensity spin bike rides.  After the two weeks were up, my foot was feeling better but I got Covid.  Took another week off from doing anything and got a run in 20 days after my previous.  Missed a few more workouts with some rebound sickness and was getting concerned as my longest run to that point was around 11 miles.  I missed my 13, 15, and 17.5 during this time.  I got sick again but was able to do my 20 mile run and was happy with the time (8:18 pace).

Cut to race day and I cannot describe the morning. I had some nerves but in a good way.  First couple miles were a little slow moving through the crowd and trying not to come out too fast.  Then I settled in and got into a bit of a groove.  I kept myself distracted by looking for my family in the crowd (saw them at 12 and 22).  My splits were getting better and I hit the halfway point around 1:50.  Based on the race elevation, I knew main incline was between 20-23, which would end around the same point I previously hit a wall.  Knowing this, I feel like I tried to hold back a little for this spot.  But my splits were getting better and I got through 20-23 in (for me) a quick pace.  At 21 or 22, in my mind, I felt as good as I did when I started and didn't think the wall would come.  At 25, still no negative signs and I decided to speed up to the end.  The last bit of the race is downhill and it helped with my fastest mile of the race.  Finished at 3:36:02 and was so happy!  I attached my splits.  Note - I used my Coros watch and it recorded the run as my Runna workout for the day, so when I got to 26.2, I still had around 1/3 of a mile to go until the finish line.

So my questions are:

How to best improve on time?  I assume the answer is more mileage as I feel like my training program was pretty light.  I don't think I ran over 30 MPW more than once or twice.  I was happy with the program and never got sick of the workouts or had any burnout, and this was a huge mental plus for me.  I was also surprised by how I felt at the finish line.  It was like finishing a 5 mile run in comparison and I had a lot of energy.  I know I could have gone faster but I was so worried about stalling out at some point.  I truly had so much fun running this year's race and am not too concerned about improving time every race if I can keep the enjoyment level at the same spot.

Is two marathons in one summer/fall reasonable?  I signed up to run Grandma's Marathon towards the end of June 2025 but feel like I would have FOMO not running Twin Cities again.  I was thinking of a week or two off after Grandma's, then starting a new program.  Is that cutting it too close?

Thanks for any feedback.  I lurked this sub the last few months while training and got a lot of good pointers.  Mainly, I didn't know super shoes were a thing!  I got a pair of Hoka Cielo X1 that I used for a couple long runs and speed work that were a game changer.

Edit: Trying to upload pics of split times.

1g59tu8,Sneakers,Shoes for Cross Training? (HIIT/Body Combat/Turbokick),"Hello! Look for recommendations!

As the title suggests, I‚Äôm looking for sneakers to wear to HIIT workout mainly body combat and turbo kick boxing where where is a bit of jumping/jumping jacks, kicks. I am fairly tall for a woman 5‚Äô9‚Äù and am looking for a shoe with a good cushion/bounce as well as support for lateral moves. If you‚Äôre familiar with tkb, then you get those leaps will need some good side support. 

I have always worn my Nike free runs but am looking to invest in a pair of training shoes for the purpose. My running shoes are comfy for walking but just doesn‚Äôt provide that structure. 

I have tried:
- Hoka (Kawana 2) and personally don‚Äôt love the fall back feeling not big fan of the rocking feeling. I do love the cushioning. 
- On (Cloud X 4) - I felt these have much less cushion than the Hoka but love the heel hug feeling as well as low profile around ankles and tongue with good support around the bridge of my feet

1g5818v,hiking,How do y‚Äôall approach foot health? (Trying to find good shoes) ,"So I have been a pretty avid hiker for the past year. I‚Äôve done probably about 100 different day hikes and explored all my local nature parks and trails. All of this I‚Äôve done in my Walmart nameless tennis shoes with minimal problem other than wear and tear. But now that I want to seriously hike/backpack, I‚Äôm looking into good shoes for it. 

My feet have a super high arches, and I can‚Äôt stand hiking boots or high tops with a tone of ankle support because when my ankle is covered I can‚Äôt move as fast. I was looking into Hokas because that‚Äôs just what I see most people wearing. 

Then I was discussing buying them with my mom, and she said she‚Äôs discovered an instagrams account (ThatBearfootCoach) that‚Äôs teaching her more about foot health and how most shoes are terrible for your feet. She said she‚Äôd rather I get zero-drop shoes with no arch support on my hikes to ‚Äústrengthen my feet‚Äù so I‚Äôm less likely to get injured. But doesn‚Äôt suddenly switching the type of shoes I wear on Trail and taking away arch support I‚Äôve had for 19+ years increase my risk of injury? 

More experienced hikers, I need your input because I don‚Äôt want to spend a fortune on the wrong shoes tbh. Is all this foot strength stuff actually based in fact? Is that something I should try and figure out before long-distance hiking? There‚Äôs a ton of (specifically health related) misinformation online, and I really can‚Äôt find information outside of that one Instagram account so I would love a more experienced opinion.

1g4fno7,RunningShoeGeeks,24 hours/100+ miles (in one race) in the Superblast 2,"Hey all, here‚Äôs an unconventional review (24 hour/100+ mile ultra race) for a conventional shoe (the Asics Superblast 2).

I wrote this as a corollary to my race report for my 24-hour race, which you can check out here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultramarathon/comments/1g4ench/cape\_fear\_24\_hour\_133155\_mi\_2nd\_oa/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultramarathon/comments/1g4ench/cape_fear_24_hour_133155_mi_2nd_oa/)

**Background/Training:** 33M, 5‚Äô10‚Äù, 160 pounds, heel striker. Largely focus on (road) ultra race distances and am interested in the optimal shoes for ultras. I typically run about 50 miles (80 km) a week at my base, increasing to 70-90 miles during training if I‚Äôm able, and largely at a 7:00-8:00 min/mile (4:20 ‚Äì 5:00 min/km) pace.

I ran in Nikes growing up, added in some Hokas sometime in 2019, and then started branching out to a more diverse shoe rotation in 2021. All of my previous long efforts/ultras have been in the Hoka Bondis. A ‚Äòfun‚Äô (depending on who you ask) fact is that I‚Äôve never run in a full carbon plated shoe ‚Äì the ‚Äòrods‚Äô of the Boston 12 are as close as I‚Äôve come. I have a pair of brand-new NEXT% that I bought at the beginning of 2020 when I was training for a marathon, but then the marathon was cancelled due to COVID, and I never wore the shoes. I haven‚Äôt done focused marathon training since then, so the shoes have just sat in my closet and I have been waiting for the right opportunity to use them. I also have a pair of the Adios Pro 3 that I got on sale for $125 that are also just sitting in my closet‚Ä¶

My current shoe rotation is as follows:

Everyday shoe: Hoka Clifton 9, Asics Novablast 4, Saucony Triumph 20

Tempo shoe: Boston 12

Long run: Hoka Bondi

Recovery: NB Fresh Foam More v4

I really like the Novablast 3 + 4 and have worn multiple pairs of them. I was never able to run in the original Superblast and missed the Paris colorway of the Superblast 2, so when the black/pink/white colorways were released, after seeing all of the positive reviews, I bought a pair. Bright pink, of course. I typically wear 12.5M, though sized up to 13 as I was interested in using these during long runs/ultras. Of note, I get the 25% medical discount at Asics, and was bummed that the Superblast wasn‚Äôt eligible.¬†

**First runs:** I have seen more and more runners wearing carbon plated shoes at ultras, and while I wasn‚Äôt quite ready to make that jump, I wanted to experiment with a ‚Äòfaster‚Äô shoe over longer distances compared to the Bondi. Obviously don‚Äôt want the first run to be an ultra, so I took the shoes out for a few 8-16 mile runs at 7:00-7:30/min/mile pace in the month leading up to the race. From the first step, the shoes felt great. Basically like a ‚Äòsnappier‚Äô Novablast and extremely responsive but also cushioned and protective. Maybe it was placebo but on a couple of the longer runs, was running 10-15 seconds faster per mile with similar effort. Had no issues with the upper + good grip. Fit well/as I would expect a size 13 to fit. A bit extra room in the toes, but this is ideal for longer efforts and to accommodate. I also experimented with slower paces and with walking ‚Äì the shoes were comfortable at 10:00/min/mile pace and I liked walking in them, so they ticked all the boxes for an ultra. I put a total of 40ish miles on the shoes prior to my 24 hour race.¬†

**Race:** I was a little bit nervous using a pair of shoes that I had not run super long distances in, though there‚Äôs always a little bit of the unknown with an ultra. I had a pair of Bondis with me as a backup, just in case. Overall, the shoes worked great ‚Äì I clearly wasn‚Äôt running super fast throughout the race. They were responsive at my fastest paces of \~8:30/mile, and cushioned when I decided to walk. I hit 133+ miles in 24 hours without a change of shoes or socks. Had a couple of blisters on my second toes, but that is pretty typical for me and I don‚Äôt blame the shoes for this. Your feet will not feel good after a 24-hour race no matter the shoes, but I feel as good as I can, all things considered. The shoes are dirty and in need of a cleaning, but look fine and I expect that I‚Äôll get many more miles out of them.

**Musing on shoes at ultras:** I feel like from 2014-2020, almost all of the shoes I would see at ultras would be Hokas/Altras. In my last couple of (road) ultras, I have noticed that, while Hokas are still the most common shoe I see on people‚Äôs feet, people seem to be branching out to many other brands and just wearing what works best for them. Off the top of my head, I saw people wearing: Adidas, Altra, Asics, Hoka, Nike, On, Sketcher, Topo, Puma, Saucony, Brooks, New Balance, Sketchers, Mount to Coast.¬†

**Overall:** The Superblast worked great for my ultra distance and I have no complaints. As others have said, I think it‚Äôs a great all-around shoe that will respond to whatever you throw at it. However, at the $200 price tag without a discount, I think it‚Äôs a little hard for me to justify the price for training when I can get a pair of the Novablast for $120 and then a pair of Boston 12s for <$80 that I think would accomplish many of the same things. And in terms of a racer, I would definitely use them again, but I‚Äôm also interested in trying carbon plated shoes for my next race (but recognize that would require training in them and adapting), so we‚Äôll see what my wallet decides.

1g44yot,Marathon_Training,First marathon,"Had my first marathon last Sunday, above expectation it was a big success! Two weeks prior to the marathon I had a lot of pain in my right groin or hip after my longest long run, this is where I decided to stop completely with the last few trainings two weeks before the race. Only 3 days before the race I tried to run 5K to verify I still have it.

I have been running my marathon plan on Hoka Clifton 9 shoes, but since they are over 600k old I decided to get new shoes (Vaporfly 3) before the marathon with the intention to get some miles in them before the marathon. Due to the fact I had to give my body some rest I was not able to get any miles in them.

At the marathon I decided to just give it a try. If I had the feeling that it is not gonna work, I would just change them back to Hoka during the race.

After the start I had a feeling this is going to be a great day. I was in a pace 4,45 (7.40 per mile) and I had no effort of holding this pace for 20 miles. As you can see below my legs started to hurt after 20 miles but still managed to stay below 6 min per k. (9.40min p/mile).

Finished my first marathon with a net time of 3:29.  
Absolutely proud of this result for a first marathoner!

What I have learned.

- Trust the process  
- Stick to your marathon plan  
- Don't do park runs instead of your scheduled long runs or easy runs  
- Easy runs should be easy and no PR sessions

1g1ogpl,sesamoid,"CT scan at five months shows no healing, do I panic?","
I feel like I‚Äôve done everything possible for this evil little bone but feel so defeated that imaging still shows it in three pieces with no evidence of callous or bridging of the gaps. The injured sesamoid feels significantly better than ever since the initial injury, so should I not despair yet and give it more time? Or do I need to go backwards and readjust my treatment plan? Any advice is greatly appreciated. The amount of frustration and debilitation caused by such a tiny bone is unreal!! 

Used to be extremely active with backpacking/climbing/mountaineering. First felt the pain five months ago while hiking downhill. Got X-rays at 1 week and 5 weeks that showed nothing. After the 5 week xray I tried rock climbing again which definitely hurt. Xray at 8 weeks finally showed fracture of lateral sesamoid. MRI confirmed it. 

I went into panic mode and threw almost everything at it that I could. For three months I‚Äôve been using exogen bone stimulator, taking calcium and vitamin d supplements, trying to stay healthy with good diet. I went non weight bearing for six weeks and did 9 treatments of ESWT (no ice or NSAIDs) and really thought that combo had turned things around. It did hurt pretty bad for a day or two while I was in the process of transitioning from crutches to the boot. Wore the tall boot for another 6 weeks along with a custom insole fitted by my podiatrist. I had mostly given up on exercise during the non weight bearing/ESWT phase but started riding my bike again (carefully) once I was cleared to walk in the boot. Started weaning into a stiff hoka with custom insole a couple weeks ago and at the same time started going for walks up to a mile. My dog was getting depressed from her drastic decrease in activity so I‚Äôve been desperate to get back to walking her.

Pain hasn‚Äôt been bad at all in weeks, I‚Äôll just get some mild pinchy feelings usually after walking but I‚Äôve read up a lot on the good pain/bad pain and thought it was okay pain, like the muscles and tendons coming back to life after not using them for so long. PT has me doing seated calf raises which does flex the big toe but I was told that was safe and wouldn‚Äôt affect the healing. 

I really believed I was healing until I saw the broken pieces on the ct scan. I‚Äôm so crushed. I greatly miss my active outdoor lifestyle and can‚Äôt imagine my life without spending long days climbing mountains. Why won‚Äôt this bone heal??",2024-10-12 00:39:15+00:00,2,7

1g0qc8g,sesamoid,"fractured sesamoid, high arches, heel pain due to arches. what shoes work the best? 23F. ","Hi everyone,

I'm currently dealing with some significant foot health issues due to my high arches. I've suffered a fracture in my sesamoid and experience heel pain when I stand for too long. Unfortunately, no pair of shoes has provided relief, and I've tried various orthotics without success.

I‚Äôm waiting on custom orthotics from my podiatrist, but I'm feeling a bit anxious about them. Currently, I wear Hoka Bondi 8s with a medium support orthotic that I've modified by cutting out a hole to relieve pressure on my sesamoid. While this has helped, my Hokas are wearing down.

Has anyone found alternative solutions or cost-effective options that work for them? I‚Äôd appreciate any recommendations or insights!

Thanks in advance!",2024-10-10 19:00:03+00:00,2,8
1g0obnx,FootFunction,Flat feet issue is ignored ,"I got plantar fasciitis ( yet again). Pretty sure my flat feet play a role but it‚Äôs the last thing always mentioned. 
All people are talking about is shoes for relieving plantar fasciitis with no regard to foot shape. Nothing works. Not Brooks, not Hokas not Oofos nothing I read online. I try them they‚Äôre comfy for 20 min then I‚Äôm in pain for days. 

I got toe surgery and now I‚Äôm in deep trouble because I can‚Äôt walk in anything open toes at all. My house sandals (10 years old and battered) were the comfiest thing I could walk in but since I got PF wearing them a month ago I am afraid of them. 

Everything is either too flat hurting the plantar fascia or too much arch support literally poking or pushing  at it. And I‚Äôm getting all this pain WITH crutches, I‚Äôm putting so much weight on my shoulders I‚Äôm almost floating off the feet. Still pain 

I am at the end of my rope. I can‚Äôt even go to the washroom or to the kitchen I can‚Äôt do literally anything. I can‚Äôt focus on work because my feet are burning. I‚Äôm in pure hell. I have orthotics in closed shoes and that part is better and I‚Äôm getting new ones but my feet hurt in those too. I can‚Äôt walk more than 5 min at a time since 4 years ago. I saw so many doctors and PT they don‚Äôt care the feet are flat. It‚Äôs same treatment for everyone.

1g0ab3u,Shoes,Comfortable business shoes?,"I'm curious if anyone has any recommendations. I have higher than average arches (more weight on ball of foot) as well as the front half of my foot being slightly wide. When I get EEs my heel wears out the back of the shoe fast from rubbing, so it's more in the shape than width. But dress shoes are usually pointy with hard soles.

I don't find flat bottom shoes like Van's comfortable because they have zero arch support, but my job doesn't allow sneakers. I wish I could wear Ultraboosts or HOKAs as I'm standing all day, but I can't. Any ideas? Thanks.

1g01ape,RunningShoeGeeks,Brooks Glycerin MAX first impression (Heavy Runner),"93kg, 168 cadence, shoes in rotation Superblast 2, Saucony speed 4, Hoka mach X2, new balance more v5.

Took them straight out of the box for a 16km run, so let's start from the top.

Probably the most comfortable upper in any shoe I've tried this year, I have a wide foot and my feet had plenty of space, no hotspots or any discomforts. You forget you have a shoe on your foot. Plenty of padding around the heel and the upper material is plenty soft and feel super durable. Don't know about the breathability as it good cooler here in Scandinavia. 

Fits true to size in my size 44.

Midsole, this is where the fun starts, feels very similar to superblast 2 after the superblast broke in. Dense bounce but with an aggressive rocker, I feel the softer midsole in the heel area and bit more denser foam in the forefoot. The shoe just rolls smoothly forward and your legs feel plenty protected. Very stable ride too. Easy to pick up the pace but it's heavier than the superblast so it's more difficult to sustain the pace. But the shoe got few gears in it that's for sure. Probably my top 3 rides of the year, and it will become my new daily trainer and long run option, the shoe doesn't ride as heavy as it is, it just feels super smooth and effortless and I will save the superblast 2 for special occasions as it's easier to find a unicorn than a superblast for sale in my size.

Outsole, ran on some pavement and gravel roads through the forest, both in wet conditions and grip was excellent. The outsole also looks like it will outlive our solar system it self.

1fzljd3,bunions,Lapiplasty and bone spur removal next week. Advice?,"Taking a ton of courage to post these ugly dogs I‚Äôve been hiding under sand at the beach and behind closed toes Birkenstocks since I was a kid.  But hoping to help others as well as to receive any advice others may have.  

Male/early 40s. Started about 2 yrs ago challenging myself to get off the office chair and log 10000 steps every day.  I took to it quick and after a full 365 days I changed to running daily, before long I was doing a 5k on my lunch break every day for half a year straight.  This grew also to 5 miles daily (in the Louisiana humidity every day during my lunch break).  I LOVE running‚Ä¶ in my 40s and have never cared about exercise of any kind when I was younger.  I want to continue this trend, but the past 6 months or more the pain and inflammation in my feet, ankles , r knee and lower back (all from jacked up compensatory gait issues- due to these bunions).  The heat/ice/elevation and constant discomfort I endure is just more than I want deal with. 

I‚Äôve met with 2 surgeons with tons of bunion procedures under their belt and rated highly through my insurance.  Met with the second guy and he told me he‚Äôd initially like to just do a normal skin osteotomy and it should look real good‚Ä¶. But after watching we stand and studying my cray images he asked if he could convene with one of his surgical partners and get back to me on the best surgical procedure for me.  I agreed and he called me back 2 days later.  He decided he‚Äôd prefer to do a lapiplasty procedure to stabilize that entire joint but also this would help retain length more than any other procedure as my great toe is already a bit short generically.  He thinks it will not only straighten up beautifully but also retain plenty of length.  He also mentioned shaving off a bone spur on my right 1st toe (I can feel this when I run) but didn‚Äôt spot it on the X-ray images as well as taking a calcaneal spongy bone graft from my heal to insert into the fused joint at the lapiplasty site to assist bone healing. 

You‚Äôll see in the images that both big toes not only have obvious bunions but also the tips raise up and medially. I expect this is extensor tendon pulling‚Ä¶. He said it would resolve with this procedure. 

So I‚Äôve acquired a knee scooter, crutches and a shower chair as well as a plastic leg shower cover.  What else can I do to prep for post op recovery? 

What about thoughts about my situation and his plan for correction? I‚Äôm nervous about the situation, but feel confident in his ability to get me where I need to be.  He knows I‚Äôm an athlete and my exercise routine is important to me and he was honest that regardless of all the commercial communication lapiplasty is not really a shorter recovery‚Ä¶ just one that he trusts to repair the situation strong and that it last as long as the rest of my body allows me to be active. 

He says if thing go as planned I should probably be close if not back to my hokas in 6-7 weeks and he‚Äôll do my right foot at that time since my deductible for insurance is met. ",2024-10-09 07:01:04+00:00,3,3

1fzf2xf,trailrunning,HOKA Speedgoat 5 vs Merrell Agility Peak 5 for travel/hiking/running?,"I'm looking for an all-purpose shoe (mainly for travel/walking around cities, hiking, and occasional running). I understand the risks of this color, but I'm hoping to find a white/beige shoe that can pass at a restaurant (not at any fancy restaurants, I just don't want something really technical looking). Unfortunately, I'm also not really a fan of an all black shoe.

I don't plan on using these shoes on super big, messy hikes. I'll usually go check out few hikes while on my travels, but they're never anything huge. I do want some tread so I'm not slipping around in case of a wetter or more technical hike, though.

Currently, my top choices are the HOKA Speedgoat 5 and Merrell Agility Peak 5. I like the look of both of them, and they seem practical for what I'm looking for. I'm also considering the Nnormal Kjerag, but I'm unsure.

Some more context of the use cases of the shoes I would get:

* Walking around the city, the most I've done in a day in the city was 42k steps, but that was an extremely long day. I probably average closer to 20k steps a day
* Hiking for a few days of a trip, up to probably around 15km in a day
* Some occasional light running, probably max a 10k, but I don't go for many runs while traveling

Can anyone speak to the durability of any of these shoes? I have heard the soles of the Speedgoats aren't the best, so I'm concerned that walking around in the city with them would wear down the lugs and sole really fast. I'm also curious if anyone has experience with cleaning any of these shoes. I don't care if they get mildly dirty, I'm just curious about how much dirt these different shoes hold.

Lastly, if anyone has other recommendations for shoes that fit what I'm looking for, I'd love to hear them. Thanks!",2024-10-09 00:33:34+00:00,4,6

1fxm15f,sesamoid,My experience so far & what's helped - for sesamoiditis & compensatory issues on opposite foot,"This forum's been great, I'm writing this to give back what I can. Also, I have not yet fully recovered, I've only seen improvement, maybe this is all wrong and will blow up in my face shortly, who knows, YMMV! FWIW: I'm a guy in my mid-thirties, am tall, and have a slimmer runner's build.

TL;DR - For my foot with sesamoiditis, the big turning point was offloading with a walking boot + dancer's pads + effective custom orthotic (strong rec below) combo, using an Exogen bone stimulator, and getting a PRP injection. More recently I've dropped the walking boot + dancer's pads and used the custom orthotic with Altra Via Olympus 2 shoes, which are by far the winning shoe for me (order ¬Ω size up from normal). For my other foot with compensatory sesamoiditis-like problems, it wasn't actually sesamoiditis. The Altras  and CorrectToes have helped, and PT looks promising. Generally speaking, I'd recommend offloading hard earlier, starting PT earlier, experimenting with CorrectToes and toe socks earlier, getting good sleep and alternative exercise earlier, and some basics re one's approach to this issue.

**Basic steps for foot with sesamoiditis (in medial sesamoids, started January 2024, confirmed by MRI on May 20 in the form of bone marrow edema):**

1. Basic offloading by stopping strenuous exercise and wearing various shoes (January-May): this seemed to stop the problem from getting worse but brought zero improvement.
   * Hoka Bondi 8s: Cushioned and rigid sole. Helpful at the beginning but proved too narrow and had a rigid sidewall that, when combined with various orthotics thicker than the factory ones, dug into my sesamoid area from below. These may have barely helped the issue, caused other issues on my other foot, etc., it's unclear. The 4E width pair that I ordered in late July helped some but didn't resolve these issues.
   * Topo Atmos: Nice wide toe box, cushioned, and zero-drop. But they had a really stiff toe box mesh that irritated the ball-of-foot joint on both feet. I learned these may run ¬Ω size too small after I stopped using them.
   * Asics Gel-Cumulus 25: Despite having many eight Gel-Cumulus models pre-sesamoiditis, these were too narrow and too flexible in the forefoot.
   * Altra Via Olympus 2: The real winner, described more below.
2. Basic supplements (since March): I used some serious vitamin D at the recommendation of my good podiatrist, plus some lower amounts of calcium, magnesium, zinc, and fish oil. I had a balanced diet and was on a multivitamin before but these can't hurt, especially the vitamin D when this issue cropped up out of nowhere midwinter.

**Turning point for foot with sesamoiditis:**

1. Serious offloading with a walking boot, dancer's pads, and *effective* orthotics:
   * I started using a walking boot on and left it fairly loose around the ankle for mobility (May 26).
      * I would strongly recommend an¬†[EvenUp](https://www.amazon.com/EVENup-Shoe-Balancer-Leveler-Large/dp/B08FX2T2TF/ref=sr_1_1?crid=H4BDJ4RVC10G&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.MlRVa89JfT3OOOna8rkQLhQDYijrz33ywvvRA7a4_f_tYZ9ocWsXK0d48H47kVbFPkP_N4tR_jqQ7As70kVYNlHw6wLMW--8ezhd4DyIwrCT45jizIgHY1JkvMCDId4GzB5gJPUT2eSbRHB73TWd8Sins2QDl2GDq20CZ98a8BKuAc9yEZrD-45A6P3LyghTcIdOUvUTvRy8wYOhVcK5vMpq7aGYOs5_x9mX6C4ixKcA7Jwfv-IVG-XR2m2ysaR9i2EBIM6YV6rU0gDHjWmzJByTa9zeD8rYfnV35OjJPp8.yCcoEUX9eVuwhM9S9_w-UFdEKA62GUGPhJxxKiwLnxo&dib_tag=se&keywords=even%2Bup%2Bshoe%2Bleveler%2Bmen&qid=1728221463&sprefix=even%2Bup%2Caps%2C93&sr=8-1&th=1)¬†to try to raise your other leg to the same height and avoid creating compensatory problems on the other leg. I didn't use one and it likely created the problems on my other foot. Heads-up, not one of my four podiatrists and orthopedic surgeons recommended this, only one even mentioned it, when describing the compensation risks of a walking boot.
   * I eventually found a good setup with two ¬º-inch-thick felt dancer's pads slightly offset from one another (pic [here](https://imgur.com/a/mFcvaLc)) underneath whatever orthotic or insole I was trying in the boot.
      * *This combination of the boot and dancer's pads certainly stopped my sesamoiditis from getting worse, and may have begun healing it a bit, but there was no significant healing yet.*
   * After several custom orthotics that didn't do much,¬†[this](https://imgur.com/a/orthotic-thats-been-key-to-improving-sesamoiditis-BYHaMm4)¬†orthotic with both a lengthwise ridge and moon-shaped cutout was a major improvement (August 1). Yes, that offloading is pretty extreme, and several docs said ""definitely don't take it any further,"" but it was the only actually-effective offloading I found. (Orthotics that didn't work had: a moon-shaped cutout, a raised pad-like part under the metatarsals, and both of these combined.)
   * Altra Via Olympus 2 shoes (since September 25): I describe these more below. I stopped using the walking boot with its dancer's pads on Sept 25. Like for my other foot, this shoe is far and away the best one I've found. Still using the orthotic but no dancer's pads - so far so good.
   * Note: If I'm not mistaken, Dr. Blake (the closest thing we have to an internet sesamoiditis guru) said somewhere that he believes most doctors don't recommend serious offloading early enough. He seemed to believe you need to hit hard and early, for even potential cases of sesamoiditis.
      * This is especially true re the walking boot, which doctors seem to hesitate to recommend due to the leg-length difference and muscle degradation. To that, I say get an EvenUp to balance the other leg, and leave the boot loose around the ankle and get a physical therapist (described more below) to maintain strength.
2. Exogen bone stimulator (2x/day since July 10): Have been using this to promote actual healing. God knows if this has actually helped but enough people, including Dr. Blake, recommend it to make me include it in the shotgun approach.
3. PRP injection (July 24): Got this to promote actual healing. Biggest gains seemed to come after week 5 or so, though the injection gave me swelling in the joint that's still here around week 13. The doc told me this is generally a low-risk, nothing-to-lose, no-reason-not-to-do-it-early step, assuming you have the money. Cheapest I've seen is $650 (Dr. Kanaan at Wake in Raleigh), most is $1500 for a top doc (Dr. Siddiqui at ROSM) in the DC area.
4. Simple time: whatever else you're doing, this injury takes plenty of time to heal.

This stuff's working one way or another. The first MRI was May 20, the boot starting May 26 stopped the slide but didn't improve much, and the improvement started around late July with the offloading & PRP & Exogen described above. Between August 6-20 I had three separate 20,000+ step days (that's 3-4hrs of normal walking) in NYC and Boston, they surprisingly went just fine. On September 23, an MRI showed significantly reduced bone marrow edema in the left sesamoid compared to the first MRI on May 20. On September 25, I stopped using the boot, and the Altra Via Olympus 2 with just the orthotic has generally seemed to work well since then. Got just a little bit cocky and paid for it - this is not an injury to push.

**Fix for opposite foot with compensatory problem (confirmed by ultrasound as MCL sprain and plantar fascia strain; confirmed to be neither bone marrow edema nor any other clear issue on MRI):**

An issue in the general ball-of-foot & sesamoid areas of my other foot developed very gradually over a few weeks (hints started around September 1, clearly an issue by September 20). It felt worryingly similar to the other foot but a little different. After wearing a boot on my left foot since May 26, and not using an [EvenUp](https://www.amazon.com/EVENup-Shoe-Balancer-Leveler-Large/dp/B08FX2T2TF/ref=sr_1_1?crid=H4BDJ4RVC10G&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.MlRVa89JfT3OOOna8rkQLhQDYijrz33ywvvRA7a4_f_tYZ9ocWsXK0d48H47kVbFPkP_N4tR_jqQ7As70kVYNlHw6wLMW--8ezhd4DyIwrCT45jizIgHY1JkvMCDId4GzB5gJPUT2eSbRHB73TWd8Sins2QDl2GDq20CZ98a8BKuAc9yEZrD-45A6P3LyghTcIdOUvUTvRy8wYOhVcK5vMpq7aGYOs5_x9mX6C4ixKcA7Jwfv-IVG-XR2m2ysaR9i2EBIM6YV6rU0gDHjWmzJByTa9zeD8rYfnV35OjJPp8.yCcoEUX9eVuwhM9S9_w-UFdEKA62GUGPhJxxKiwLnxo&dib_tag=se&keywords=even%2Bup%2Bshoe%2Bleveler%2Bmen&qid=1728221463&sprefix=even%2Bup%2Caps%2C93&sr=8-1&th=1) to equal out the other leg's length, I'd likely created a compensation/overuse injury over time. It turns out my right foot had an MCL (inner-side) ligament sprain, plus a plantar fascia sprain where it inserts into the sesamoid, but no sesamoiditis in the form of bone marrow edema or any other issue detectable by MRI.

* Lesson learned: Don't assume it's the exact same sesamoiditis problem as on the other foot. My podiatrist and orthopedic surgeon, basically saying ""no matter what the problem is, the fix is the same as on your other foot, took this shortcut and I'm glad I didn't listen. I self-paid for an MRI and another doctor used an ultrasound to check - it was worth both getting the correct diagnosis and avoiding an incorrect one. If I'd listened to the doctors on this one, I'd be offloading like crazy and wouldn't have been spurred to take the steps below.

I believe three things helped turn it around a good 70% within a few weeks:

1. Altra Via Olympus 2 shoes: This is the everything-I-want shoe that has made a real difference. Wide toe box, zero drop, highly cushioned and yet stiff-soled enough to not bend under the forefoot, and with soft side mesh. Just know that their sizing is in general ¬Ω size too small and somewhat inconsistent - that's from the shoe salespeople in my orthopedist foot specialist's office and matches my experience.
   * Given the Hoka Bondi 8 (including 4E width) issues described near the top, I saw logic in not only a wide toe box, but a zero-drop shoe that didn't try to over-engineer max support/stability/etc. into a shoe. All that engineering creates a lot of extra variables. I'd worn zero-drop shoes for years pre-sesamoiditis so it wasn't hard to restart. I'm no shoe expert, that's just where my experience and gut led me.
2. CorrectToes toe spacers
   * Heads-up, even if they ease pain immediately, I'd follow directions to gradually ease into using them. I have slight hammer toes and ignored the serious pressure on my big toes' nail beds, despite only using them on and off for about three weeks in July. 2mos later, both big toenails were messed up, one so much it was infected and needed removal. So ease into it and watch for pressure/pain spots, CorrectToes has lots of recommended modifications if you need! Or in my case, just cut the flaps over your big toes and really smooth out any resulting edges with an Exacto knife.
   * I've ordered Injinji toe socks. They may do the same thing without the risks, or without the occasional discomfort or simple bulkiness of toe spacers. You can also wear them all day and sleep in them, something I don't
3. Physical therapy (started focusing on this issue on September 23): the PT's helping heal the actual injuries and prevent something similar from the strength/flexibility/mobililty/ side. Lots of potential contributing issues here, especially trigger points that we're using dry needling to resolve (this turned around my chronic patellar tendinitis 10yrs ago but that's another story), but we're not that far into it.

**Other tips:**

* What I wished I'd done differently:
   * Offload hard and early: Dr. Blake said somewhere that he doesn't think most doctors hit hard and early enough with offloading. I cannot agree more. From January through May 2024, I half-assed offloading in the form of rest from serious exercise and Hokas, this only stopped the slide but didn't improve anything.
   * Do PT early: I wish I'd started physical therapy way earlier, I only started on September 17. None of the docs recommended it, but that's the relative expert in your corner for an actual 1 hour per week, following the ups and downs of your injury, with instincts you lack (for not only info like¬†[this](https://www.reddit.com/r/sesamoid/comments/1f5dg83/update_postbrain_dump/)¬†but also exercises, order, execution, common pitfalls, etc.), making sure you aren't missing anything big, doing any silly self-fixes, keeping the boxes checked for general strength/flexibility/mobility (all have had significant room for improvement for me), etc. For me, they're the closest I've come to a GP that might actually scan for & understand the comprehensive problem, rather than silo'ed podiatrists and orthopedic foot-oriented surgeons who seem to lose the forest for the trees.
   * Experiment early with CorrectToes toe spacers and/or toe socks: I bought these in July, they always made the problem feel better but I stopped due to discomfort that I've seen found a fix for. These are made by Dr. Ray McClanahan, who has a root-cause biomechanical theory for sesamoiditis that makes  Since getting the compensatory issue I've used them more.
   * Sleep well and be serious about alternative exercise, earlier and diligently: Sleep is your body's self-repair time. I need to regularly break a sweat to stay sane, so after dropping all running and hiking, I should have swam, used a stationary bike with my heels, rowed with my heels, etc. Should have taken these basics more seriously from the start.
* General advice re one's approach:
   * Experiment to find good doctors: This assumes you have some choices. I switched from my original podiatrist to a widely-admired guy in my city. I also switched from my original foot-specialized orthopedic surgeon, who's at the end of his career and who despite his clear confidence appears criminally undertrained at this point - these docs are out there. I now place most of my trust in a younger, top-credentialed regenerative medicine specialist, plus my physical therapist, who strikes me as truly knowledgeable and on-it. I can't recommend a regenerative medicine specialist enough - mine knew PRP injections well, he knew the less painful techniques (mine wasn't too bad while the orthopedic surgeon said his can leave people sobbing), and they're generally younger and more recently trained. The doctors that initially seemed intellectually-interested and truly engaged have proven best over time, for me. If you don't have choices re doctors, I'd try to save and travel to see the good ones. I'd have gotten very premature surgery by now had I not shopped around.
   * It's a Rubik's cube, keep twisting it: Having kept twisting mine since January 2024, I'm finding stuff that works over time. Around July I decided to start taking a shotgun approach to high-potential solutions, that was indeed the turning point. As Dr. Blake¬†[says](https://www.drblakeshealingsole.com/2021/05/sesamoid-fracture-dr-blakes-office.html), most of these injuries do indeed heal, you just need patience and diligence.
   * Spend the $ if you have it, especially for concrete initial and follow-up diagnoses: I also gave up on frugality with that shotgun approach to high-potential solutions. It's been financially painful but no regrets. This includes a decision to self-pay for my September 23 MRI on both feet. For my sesamoiditis foot, it gave me peace of mind and concrete encouragement to hold steady on my current path, and for the other foot's issues, well, it was half of what got me the correct diagnosis, which proved really valuable.
   * 2 steps forward, 1 step back: It's been this the whole time, with regular minor setbacks. Just do everything gradually, don't get cocky, and learn from what seems to work vs. hurt it.

That all highlights what I think is the turning point in recovering for me, personally, fingers crossed. I hope it sparks some good ideas. This sub has been wonderful for ideas, make sure you look at its top posts over time. The other extensive anecdotal posts will complement mine here (I liked and have drawn from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/sesamoid/comments/1dbx5j1/sesamoid_fracture_what_worked_for_me_and_what/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/sesamoid/comments/wgccfo/22f_ive_had_a_nearly_2_year_journey_with_my/)).

1fu8isp,RunningShoeGeeks,HOKA Mach X 2,"Drop:     5 mm
Weight: 241 grams (8.5 oz)
Forefoot Stack: 39 mm
Heel Stack:	  44 mm
Midsole Foam: PEBA Top / EVA Lower
Midsole Plate:  PEBAX Renew Plate
Color:  Frost / Citrus

First month in the HOKA Mach X 2.

I really like these shoes for my upper level Zone‚ô°2 Training Runs, Long Runs and Tempo Runs.  The combination of PEBAX Energy Plate over the PEBA top layered midsole makes for a firm but springy ride with great energy return.  However they feel a bit too heavy and simply not fast enough for the fast turnover a Hill Repeat or Speed Workout demands.

The upper while being very minimalistic and breathable racing shoe light with no extra material or layers for comfort is paired with a tri-level layered super-trainer midsole that provides a lot of protection.

Despite the obvious weight savings of the upper, it still feels a bit heavier but the good energy return makes this feel like a great shoe for racing a marathon in, tempo runs, long endurance runs and even upper level Zone 2 Training Runs where the energy return is greatly appreciated.

However the Mach X 2s definitely feel more than a bit too stiff and overkill for Recovery Runs and even lower level Zone 2 Training Runs.  It just doesn‚Äôt have the comfort and squishy goodness that a true Recovery Run shoe like the New Balance Fresh Foam X Mores or 1080s provide.

The Mach X 2 definitely feels faster then the carbon fiber plated HOKA Skyward X super trainer (which just felt big, heavy, slow yet stiff and clunky to me) and it is faster than the New Balance Balos which has a similar PEBA upper EVA lower midsole design but without an energy plate and has been steadily becoming my dedicated go-to Zone‚ô°2 Training Shoe.

Where the Mach X 2 lacks is in speedy turnover in comparison to a true Speed Shoe like the lighter though non-plated New Balance Rebel v4 which would have been the better choice for a Hill Repeats or Speed workout.  Or the lighter carbon fiber plated New Balance SuperComp Pacer v2 which was designed as an elite level Marathon and Half Marathon racing super shoe but is marketed as a dedicated 5K to 10K racing shoe that I find also makes an outstanding speed training shoe.

Though admittedly it is right up there with the New Balance SuperComp Trainer v3 for long distance endurance runs, given the choice, for Tempo Runs I would pick the HOKA Mach X 2.",2024-10-02 05:01:12+00:00,56,11

1ftp1ut,trailrunning,Nike Pegasus Trail 5 review - 20 miles at the Adirondacks,"[Happy with fabric durability - although it does absorb the mud particles into the mesh easily. ](https://preview.redd.it/j6z2m0kzh5sd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d6cfa9311798ce04f38551794c30d81fe5052378)

Used the Nike Pegasus Trail 5 at a pretty crazy hike up Mt Marcy, along with carrying a pack.

Conditions were pure mud and wet rock, just endless wet rock. Lots of elevation, lots of downhills, all on wet rock.

I size 8.5 on running shoes, and I went up a size with 9.5 on these Nikes

Pros

++++ Comfortable. The toebox, while not Altra wide, is honestly really nice and **decently wide**. Not once did I thought about my toes the entire time. The mesh has a slight stretch that makes it feel ""sweatpants"" comfort. Nothing like the restrictive mesh on Altra Lone Peak or the steel toe feeling of Speedgoat.

++ React foam feels great. I didn't have sore feet despite really really stepping on so many rocks, some jagged even.

++ High quality. I don't worry about the outer mesh at all, and even through mud and rock scrapes the fabric has held up perfectly. And the outsole is also quite durable as well. I'm just really happy with the quality of this shoe overall and would not be remotely afraid to abuse it.

++ Looks. It's a great looking shoe. What more can I say. Nike knocked the design out of the park here and their colorways are fresh. Can totally be used as a travel shoe after outsoles wear out. I also like that it doesn't start looking bad when it's caked with dirt.

Cons

---- Not good at wet rock. At all. I was slipping a lot honestly and I didn't feel the confidence to step on any wet rock, I would always feel a bit skittish that I would slip. Now, this could just be an Adirondacks thing because every rock there was coated with mud from other people trying to avoid mud as well so, but I don't have other shoes to compare with unfortunately. But again, wet rock kinda renders this shoe useless. Would love to see this fixed in future Pegasus trial.

--- No tongue keeper. They need to add a tongue keeper, as first time use and the tongue falling to the side is unacceptable imo. Just makes it look sloppy.

-- Logo on the insole is falling apart. Very disappointed at this as this introduces microplastics onto the trail.

COMPARED TO OTHER SHOES (these are the ones I tried in store)

VS Altra Lone Peak, Timp - Altras have this weird narrowness in the middle section of their uppers (why... you have a wide toebox, why ruin it with a narrow as fuck middle section???). Timps, Lone Peak, all narrow in the middle. Nike doesn't have this problems. Also, Nike quality >>>>>> Altra quality and it's not even close.

VS Altra Experience Wild - Altra Experience Wild comfort is a step up from Nike, again I have no comfort issues on Nike but Experience Wild takes it to the next level. However, the low padded heel is weird as fuck, and Altra quality just feels terrible in person. They really just look like $50 Wal-Mart shoes, is the best way I would describe it. The foam on Altras are a joke compared to the dense Nike React foam. Like pool noodle foam quality almost.

VS HOKA Speedgoat - Speedgoat 6 is a joke. Just, dont even consider it. It's way too narrow everywhere, like Hoka really hates width for some reason. Speedgoat 5 - eh. Not a fan. Nikes are way more comfortable.

VS HOKA Challenger - Again, HOKA hates width. Expect it to be narrow compared to Nikes. Nike wins hands down.

VS Nike Zegama 2 - idk but Zegama 2 feels bad to me. The stack height on Zegamas is way too high for stability and the Zegama 2 are just really stiff. Pegasus comfort >>> Zegama

SO YES, Pegasus is GREAT. The main flaw is just it's bad on wet rock. If Nike solves this problem of the outsole being bad on wet rock, I think Pegasus might be the perfect trail runner.

1fto7yf,Marathon_Training,Daily Running Shoes - Hoka Skyflow or Clifton 9?,"Hi!

I previous used Clifton 8 and Mach 5 training for a fall 2023 marathon.

They were superb at the start but about 8 weeks into training (approximately 100 miles each) my foot/heel really started to hurt, as though there was no cushioning. It's weird I know - a lot of Hoka users swear by the cushioning. I swapped them out for Adidas Boston 12 and Saucony Triumph and had no issues thereafter.

I'm back from injury and starting to slow-train for a Spring marathon. Tempted to try Skyflow or Clifton 9 to rotate with my Saucony Triumph 21 which I love to bits.

Would be grateful for thoughts:

1/ Any views, good or bad, on Clifton 9?

2/ Any views, good or bad, on Skyflow?

3/ Any other daily trainers you would recommend? I heel strike and have a high-ish arch but not a particular concern.

1ftbcu5,RunningShoeGeeks,Saucony Hurricane 24 35 mile review - most underrated shoe of 2024?,"Stats: 5‚Äô11 185, currently running 35-45 MPW training for my second HM. Easy pace 9:00-10:00/mi. Mid-to-heel striker with borderline wide feet.

Current rotation: SB2 (long runs/longer tempo), ES4 (speed/shorter tempo), NB 880 v14 (daily).   
Past shoes I‚Äôve liked: Triumph 21, Pegasus 39
Shoes that I‚Äôve tried and didn‚Äôt like: Triumph 22, Ghost Max, Bondi 8, 1080v13, Gel-Nimbus 26. 

I picked these up looking for a comfortable recovery day shoe after trying & being disappointed with a few of the aforementioned options. It should be apparent it‚Äôs been a journey to find a slow day shoe that I really love. I run in them 1-2x/week at the most with runs ranging from 4-7 miles, all at easy/recovery pace.  

Fit/design: The fit is roomy with a very wide base and plenty of room in the toebox, lockdown was great and that‚Äôs something I often struggle with unless I heel lock. The laces are pretty short so it would be tough to heel lock anyway. The upper disappears on the run with good breathability, I did multiple runs in 80+ degree heat without major issues. My main gripe about the fit is the non-gusseted tongue, which slides out of position on my (somewhat wonky) right foot requiring me to readjust. The upper is overall very comfortable without feeling overly plush which is what I experienced with the Gel-Nimbus.  I do have durability concerns in this shoe with the exposed midsole foam in the midfoot, but since I use this shoe somewhat sparingly it wasn‚Äôt a dealbreaker for me. 

Ride: This is where the shoe vastly exceeded my expectations. Saucony absolutely nailed the ratio of PWRRUN PB & PWRRUN. I‚Äôve tried the SC Elite v4 in stores briefly and the squish/bounce was reminiscent of a plateless version of it. I found it to have the softness of the Nimbus with much more bounce back, so I never felt like the shoe was holding me back despite its weight. I don‚Äôt have stability needs but the wide base & minor stability elements only further helped keep my feet in line. I would rate it second to the SB2 in my rotation in terms of keeping my feet the freshest. With that said, I never made any attempt to pick up the pace in this shoe and would not expect it to perform well at any faster than an easy effort.  

Final thoughts: For those looking for a soft, max-cushion ride that still has some pep, I‚Äôd recommend looking into the Hurricane. I haven‚Äôt tried the older version but think if Saucony can dial in the outsole and fix the tongue they would have an amazing shoe on their hands. I‚Äôm not holding out hope for either unfortunately since Saucony seems to be marketing this shoe more towards lifestyle/being a Hoka alternative. I think this shoe would notably be great for beginners who are in a run/walk stage of their running journey as it feels great as a walking shoe also.

I bought a pair of hoka mach X 2s last week thinking that they have a carbon plate. After researching after I bought them, it seems they have a pebax plate instead. I've ran in them and they feel good but left wondering if I'm missing out on sn extra edge.

I'm reading so much about how a carbon plate could knock off 10 mins off my time and now I'm stressing wondering if I should make a last minute purchase for sine carbon racers.

Am I overthinking it? Will there be really much difference?",2024-09-30 19:55:54+00:00,0,18

The fit was TTS and the upper feels very comfortable and breathable. The ride was exceptionally smooth and they have a great bounce and rocker shape. I did notice a little Achilles irritation on my right foot when I finished. I wasn‚Äôt bleeding or anything. I used them again for 10K today and loved the ride again except for more rubbing on the Achilles. I definitely recommend wearing thick quarter/crew socks with these. Any other tricks to remedy this issue? I absolutely love them and want to keep them. This is the only other Hoka shoe besides the Cielo X1 I‚Äôve liked.

1frup8r,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Rocket x2,"Hola Rocket X2
US9.5
Paid 250USD at Runner‚Äôs Roost in Denver
Run: 6k with 3 x 1k repeats at 3:35-3:45/km, 5:00-5:20/km float in between.

Upper: Engineered mesh. Narrow. For my low volume, narrow but high arch feet perfectly. No heel counter but padding on both sides and zero slip. Stretched just slightly during run. Have not budged subsequently. A bit touchy to get on, will leave shoehorns in place for tri. 

Insole: Glued in. I normally run in custom orthotics which is not possible in this shoe. Not sure what the sockliner is made of or whether I could muscle it out. 

Midsole: Rockered, relatively deep sidewalls with a wider waist than the ASICS Metaspeed which I LOVED but couldn‚Äôt justify given stability issues. They feel denser to me than the vaporfly I tried. Honestly the vaporfly would have been my preference as the toe-off and interaction with the plate was so apparent and intuitive, but couldn‚Äôt get the VF to fit me correctly. Higher stack and more rockered than my Puma Deviate Nitro Elite 2, which I consider inferior as a race shoe now. 

Outsole: Better than the usual Hoka garbage rubber that wears down in 15 minutes. Honestly this is a drawback for Hoka road shoes, when ASICS, Puma, Adidas all have such superb outsoles. This seems better than my Arahi, Rincon 3, etc and gripped way better in the rain. It was wet, raining on a 800m flat circuit around a rectangular water tower in Brisbane, Australia. If it‚Äôs wet there, my mother Hoka are like ice skates. This was fine, more in line with my Puma and ASICS Noosa Tri. 

Ride: Energetic, there‚Äôs a learning curve to this in terms of loading the shoe and popping off the plate, but when I get it, it‚Äôs fairly propulsive and it feels more stable than the ASICS Metaspeed Edge or Sky (medial collapse) or Nike VF3 (need to maintain good form), but a bit less propulsive than either. On balance, I like this because if my form deteriorates at the end of an Olympic distance tri, my injury history (tib post, FHL), make me concerned either of the other plated racers might not jibe and I‚Äôll end up injured. 

Goal is to race these at the actual Noosa Triathlon and see if I can go under 40 minutes for the 10k at the end. I‚Äôll update after that with a fuller review.

2 and half years later the pain is still there aggravated by weight bearing, wearing the wrong , too tight shoes. Etc.

My training consists of long run, easy run, threshold runs/tempo. I have currently just used whatever shoe, and tried not to used the same pair two days in a row. But now I am wondering if some pairs are better suited to certain types of run?

Edit: mistake in the model name. ",2024-09-22 14:46:00+00:00,0,7
1fmmet4,RunningShoeGeeks,"Initial thoughts after my first run in the Brooks Glycerin Max, plus some comparisons.","About me: 33M, 5'8"" and 193 lbs. Lift weight 6-7 times a week and run 3-4 times a week. I run for fun and don't usually have an exact time goal in mind, just kinda run by feel and enjoy the good vibes ü§ò

Got the shoe at my local running shoe store today and I gotta do what I gotta do. Went on a short progression run with the shoe and I gotta say I'm quite surprised with what the shoe can do. There are a lot of things to like but there are a few things that Brooks need to work on.

First thing first, the shoe reminds me a lot of the Hoka Skyward X: on the heavier side, cushioned but responsive, sorta a cruiser but definitely can pick up the pace. On my last mile, I just kinda pushed it a little bit and the shoe responds really well with my foot strikes, it still feels effortless at that pace. However I do feel like the Hoka Skyward X is slightly more responsive and more stable since it has a plate in it but overall, the ride quality is very similar. I do like the upper in the Brooks Glycerin Max better but it's not perfect. The upper hugs my foot better compared to the the Hoka Skyward X but the tongue is bit too short and not gusseted so as you slide your foot in, the tongue keeps getting pushed down and you have to yank it back up and adjust it. The heel area is secure but I would love it to be a bit higher. There's no heel slipping by any means but it keeps giving me that heel slipping feeling due to how low the heel counter is. Outsole-wise, the shoe unfortunately already starts collecting little rocks in those tiny holes in the rubber on the out sole but it's not a big deal so far. As a max cushion running shoe, the Brooks Glycerin Max definitely delivers and I absolutely enjoyed my run with it today.

Second thing though and this is where it might be a bit controversial: the price tag. I personally think that shoe is worth the price and it's gonna last a good long while. However, I'm a running shoe addict and enjoy having a big collection to rotate on my runs but not all runners are like that. Don't get me wrong, the shoe is a solid all-rounder but there are several options out there that can somewhat do the same and provide a better value. Here are some of those options;

- New Balance More v5: some of y'all probably already start typing and saying that this is not an all-arounder and I kinda agree but at that $155 price tag, the shoe is worth looking into as an alternative. I wouldn't say it's a fast shoe because the new Fresh Foam X midsole is super plush but it's pretty resilient and can certainly pick up the pace when you just want to slide in a quick sprint/walk session here and there. It's also a really good shoe for long distance sessions due to how comfortable it is. The only concern is that the shoe might be too soft for some people and might not last as long as the Brooks Glycerin Max.

- Mizuno Neo Vista: this is a very good shoe that can do a lot of things that most shoes at this $180 price tag cannot do. The shoe is lightweight and the midsoft is soft yet responsive hence it can be very versatile. I personally haven't had any bad experience running in this shoe. The ride is somewhat similar to the Brooks Glycerin Max AND it's lighter AND it's cheaper. This is one of the better options. One thing though, not exactly a complaint but the soleussy (the giant midsole cutout at the bottom of the shoe) can be noticeable at times, it doesn't effect the performance or anything but depending on how you strike your foot, you might have to get used to noticing it, that's all.

- Asics Superblast 2: At $200, this shoe beats the Brooks Glycerin Max at being an all-rounder. The first Asics Superblast was the first shoe kinda started this whole high-stacked (over 40mm) all-rounder thing and it was a great shoe at the time (still is, to be honest). The second version gets even better than the first version since it improves the upper and reconstructs the midsole to make it more comfortable at slower pace yet still energetic at faster pace. The Asics Superblast 2 might not be as soft as the Brooks Glycerin Max but it's very responsive and much lighter (nearly 2 oz lighter) which makes speedwork or long distance sessions easier to handle. If you have $200 to spare, I will always suggest getting the Asics Superblast 2 over the Brooks Glycerin Max.

To sum it up, I enjoy running the Brooks Glycerin Max. It's a good shoe and I'm gonna have a lot of fun running in it in future runs but in the midst of all these awesome high stack/max cushion running shoes, I'm not really sure where the Brooks Glycerin Max stands and find it hard to suggest the shoe to anybody unless they're a big fan of Brooks running shoes.

TLDR: Good shoe but sometimes good is not good enough.

1fmfkq1,trailrunning,Best shoes for trail running/ hiking technical terrain ,I have a little bit of a unique circumstance. I‚Äôm just getting into trail running and I hike a lot as well. My left leg is shorter than the other so I need to have a lift made for the bottom of the shoe. I also put a lift inside the shoe. Main problem is my heel comes out because of this. Does anyone know a good shoe that is relatively deep on the inside so that I can put a lift in without having my heel come loose? I was looking at the Hoka speedgoat 5 MID GTX shoe because of the ankle stability and it looks like a deep enough shoe to put a lift in without any problems. ,2024-09-21 23:15:41+00:00,0,18
1fm4zhz,RunningShoeGeeks,"Initial Thoughts x 3: Nike AF3, Nike VF3, Saucony Endorphin Elite","
[New to RSG here. Mods please tell me if anything needs fixing for being in the wrong place, not allowed, missing detail etc.]

I picked up a few of pairs of super shoes with a view to deciding which to buy ahead of the 2024 fall marathons. I‚Äôll be running Chicago in mid-October. I am aware that these shoes have all been on the market for some time now, but I wanted to share my thoughts for two reasons. (1) it has been hard to find ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù feedback online on the Nike AF3 that mirrors my own short experience with the shoe. Also (2) I cannot shake a slight ‚ÄúAITA‚Äù feeling for having a more moderate opinion on a shoe that is near-universally worshipped by the massive online community (deservedly so given its achievements on the feet of some of the elites ‚Äî times and podiums). Wondering if there are more people out there with a similar view.  

I took these shoes on the treadmill for about 5 mins each at around MP (6:05‚Äì6:25 per mile or 3:45‚Äì4:00 per km) given the intended use. Unfortunately not longer given the intention to return at least one pair. Stream of consciousness reactions below:

1) Saucony Endorphin Pro 1 ‚Äî just to warm up and have a baseline to compare to. This is my current racing shoe and has been for the past couple of years.

2) Saucony Endorphin Elite ‚Äî similar and familiar Saucony feeling vs EP1, but better and more extreme in every way as you would hope a few generations later and with a new foam. I remember being amazed at the EP1 rocker when I first put them on back in the day. Now it just feels normal after 3 HMs and 1 M in them. EE is much more aggressive and I really feel like I‚Äôm being rolled forward again, in a good way. Plus the foam feels softer and more protective for the marathon distance, but somehow also more responsive. Some raw thoughts were ‚Äúthis could be nice and helpful in the last 5mi of the marathon‚Äù and ‚ÄúI could keep at this rhythm for a long time‚Äù.

3) Nike VaporFly 3 ‚Äî actually found these more comparable in ride and feel to the Endorphin Elite than to the AF3. On balance, the Endorphin Elite feels a little more protective, more stable, and a touch heavier than the VF3, all in a way that I would prefer for the marathon distance. The VF3 feels lighter and ‚Äúlower profile‚Äù / closer to the ground, despite the published stack heights not suggesting as much. I would pick the VaporFly 3 over the Endorphin Elite for everything 10k or below given this more minimal feel. Not sure for the HM.

4) Nike AlphaFly 3 ‚Äî was very excited to try this and see what the hype is about, and to run in ‚Äúthe‚Äù shoe. Indeed the initial feel is about as unnatural as the shoe looks. Ramping up the speed, starting at 5min/km or 8min/mi, it felt uncomfortable. Not necessarily a bad thing, it just occurred to me that this is not what the shoe was designed for. I have occasionally seen people out on slower jogs in these shoes ‚Äî totally fine and each to their own preferences ‚Äî but my own immediate thought was this could never be me. At this pace, it felt like I was sinking a bit deep into the ZoomX heel/midfoot area, really having to work to get up on top of the Air pods to push off, and not really getting the benefit of the bounce because of how slowly I was transitioning. Ramping up the speed to HM/MP, everything started to make more sense. With the quicker transitions, getting on top of the Air pods became more natural and was starting to feel the famous bounce. Even at this pace though, I found myself wanting to stamp harder and harder on the forefoot to get the response, and trying to pitch myself further forward than usual to spend as little time as possible on the heel and mid foot. If I were deciding for a 5k or 10k race, the AF3 would be my clear winner vs the Endorphin Elite ‚Äî for these shorter distances, I feel as if I could put enough power through the shoes that they seem to demand and sustain it for the full duration of the race. But I decided that this is not what I would want from my marathon shoe, and so have decided on keeping the Endorphin Elite. Again not sure for the HM. 

I have been trying to reconcile this experience with the following observations:

1) I have come across very few published opinions that match my own ‚Äî the AF3s receive near-universal worship online and in the press, and I see tons of them at races worn by people of all abilities from the elites at the front of the pack towards those at the back. Clearly Nike is doing something right with their marketing‚Ä¶ but do all of these people genuinely determine that the AF3 is the best shoe for them? In which case AITA? Or, more specifically, does the AF3 really work that well for so many people, but I somehow have preferences/gait quite different to your typical runner (which seems unlikely given my training shoe choices are reasonably vanilla)?

2) My experience with the AF3 kind of makes sense in my head as my 5k pace (not sure exactly probably around 5:30/mi or 3:25/km) is almost getting down towards MP for some of the slightly slower elite women, who represent the start of the real target market. Does this mean I am too slow to benefit from the AF3 for the intended marathon distance, but am well suited to them for the 5k? Does this mean that we mortals who typically run slower than this are spending a lot of money on a shoe that does not benefit their performance very much?

3) @labratrundown on instagram has suggested the AF3 has better running economy benefits vs the EE for someone of a similar profile to my own (tested at 6:00‚Äì6:15/mi if I remember right). Was the AF3 truly helping me out more than the Saucony shoes, but 5 minutes on the treadmill was never going to do it justice and I simply wasn‚Äôt used to the new feeling yet? In other words, have I opted for the Saucony shoes because they felt more familiar given my experience with many of their other shoes, but the AF3 would have given me more performance benefits?

I fully acknowledge everyone has different preferences/gaits/paces/stability needs etc., meaning that what works for one might not work for another. Sometimes I find the following context is helpful: male, 6‚Äô2‚Äù, 170‚Äì175lbs, 65mpw at peak of marathon block. Recent performances 10k 36mins, HM 1:19, M 2:49, all done in the OG Saucony Endorphin Pro 1. At marathon pace, cadence is 177‚Äì180spm. Other shoes that have worked for me in the recent past (generally have looked for mild stability/guidance) include: Hoka Arahi 4, 5, 6; Saucony Tempus (switched after Hoka didn‚Äôt release a new version of Arahis for a long time and I was done waiting); Saucony Triumph 22 and ES4 (switched from Tempus because I wanted to start a 2-shoe rotation and the Tempus as it didn‚Äôt really make sense on either side of it, and I also wanted to try to move towards totally neutral shoes)",2024-09-21 15:01:35+00:00,38,13
1fm4v22,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka mach X 2 50km review,"Heavy runner, 92 kg, high cadence midfoot striker. Shoes in rotation, Asics superblast 2, New balance more v5, adidas adios pro 3, Saucony triumph 21, Saucony endorphin speed 4.

Upper, very race like, no issues with the heel or laces, laces are actually really good and long, upper is tight around the midfoot but roomy in the toe box, I have a wide foot but fits me very well. They come in wide, so go for a wide option if you have a really wide foot. Runs true to size (eu 44). Saw reviews about the heel causing people issues but I haven't had any rubbing or discomfort. 

Midsole, very responsive, and medium soft, you sink in slightly and bounce back up really quick. Hoka arguably has the best Peba foam on the market right now, it just feels really balanced and bouncy. Big stack height but the shoe feels and runs very nimble. It's honestly impressive how the stack hight is 44 in the heel and 39 in the front but it doesn't midsole doesn't flare out wide. 5mm drop feels really good.

Outsole, very grippy and durable, no signs of wear, ran on mixed terrain, with some gravel paths, no issues whatsoever.

The ride, arguably ride of the year for me, right next to superblast 2, the mach X2 feels bit bouncier and nimble, where as the superblast 2 feels a bit more firm and responsive especially on long runs.

Took the mach x2 for some speed sessions, daily run and half marathon, and the shoe just does a really good job no matter what pace you run at, the shoe makes running feel effortless and fun, thanks to the Peba foam in the midsole. Despite the high stack you can throw some serious pace in the shoe and it just responds really really well, can be used on long slow runs as well, it's really well cushioned and didn't bottom out on me. 

For me this is the closest superblast 2 competitor, multi purpose shoe that you can use on variety of different runs and have a lot of fun in it. The upper might not work for everyone, but if you can make the upper work for you, and you can't get your hands on the superblast 2, this is as close as it comes. Superblast 2 is probably a little bit better in terms of stability and comfort, especially on long runs, where as the Hoka mach x2 is bit better in picking up the pace and speed sessions. You can even use it on race day.

The shoe feels really well built and durability seems really really good, I feel like I can easily get 600-800km out of it (500 miles)",2024-09-21 14:56:02+00:00,139,78

For a ""little"" background i was always a bigger kid, played Sports through my childhood, swapped it out for video games when I was about 13 and i just never really worked out after that. On my 18th birthday I was 6'2 320lbs. Starting the first day of my senior year I vowed to lose weight so from September to February I lost 60lbs, went to the gym before school for an hour a few times a week for a couple months and focused mainly on cardio as I didn't know what I was doing. Once I graduated high school I didn't exercise anymore and the freedom of not having any responsibility took over in all aspects of my life. Graduated in June of 2018 at about 275lbs. fast forward to july 2022 for my yearly physical and I was at an all-time High of 340lbs, got diagnosed with fatty liver and started taking weight loss serious in January of 2023. By October I had lost 70lbs just eating clean and going for a handful of walks. I am primarily sedentary and really need something to fill my time. I hit a plateau and I needed to ""reset"" my body to lose more weight. So I stopped being in a deficit and that quick reset turned into months of eating 2500 calories a day and now I'm back at 294 from my lowest of 273.¬†

I don't want to make this discussion about running shoes, i've been doing research on a handful of shoes including nike Pegasus 40, Hoka solimar, Hoka Mach 60 (i have wide feet). I can walk for miles with no problem, I might feel it the next couple of days but that's obvious since I sit in a chair for 12 hours a day. For a big guy I've always been a fast runner, not that speed matters, i just wanna be able to run for more than 10 seconds. But since I've gained more weight I can't run for a long periods of time as I'm sure you could assume since my body is not longer conditioned and hasn't been for 12 years. My question is, should I start with a walk into light jog and see where I'm at, or should I just start trying to run at a moderate speed and up the duration every day? The second option might not be the smartest but mentally i feel like it would make me feel like im making more progress, maybe its just a me thing",2024-09-18 19:23:51+00:00,2,6
1fjw1bz,BeginnersRunning,[Seeking Advice] Leg pain with new shoes,"Went on a 7k run today and for the first few kms felt a decent amount of discomfit with shins and feet. This happens sometimes and has been an issue since I bought new running shoes. 

However, from 5-7km, my feet just went numb. Never felt this before and definitely was a bit spooked. Despite the leg / feet pain, my body felt quite good. I usually get pretty physically tired after a run but felt surprisingly alright. 

My initial thoughts is this is because of the new shoes. I just bought Hoka Clifton 9s (old shoes were Adidas Ultra Boosts), which has thicker soles and higher heel drop then what I‚Äôm used to. 

Perhaps the higher heel drop creates a different stride which relies more on legs and the thicker soles localized the vibrations from contact to just the legs vs spreading to rest of the body?

1fj5tqw,hiking,Feet sliding sideways in trail runners on steep downhills,"When I'm hiking downhill in my trail runners on steep and rough terrain, my feet move so far sideways that the downhill side of each of my feet is no longer protected by the sole of the shoe. This has happened in different brands. Both have sticky grip on the soles, which is why I got them. It's slowing me down as my feet are hurting unnecessarily. Lace locking helps only so much. The shoes aren't otherwise too big. 

Do I need to go back to boots? (Those hurt my ankles by keeping them too immobile.) I appreciate the comfort and grippiness of trail runners as well. (I do have the Hoka boots, and will try them on my next hike, and see if they're any different.) 

Is there any other lacing technique or shoe I should try? (I've tried Speedgoat, Mafate, and La Sportiva Bushido III. The issue with the La Sportiva is that I can't lace them at all once I put in an insole to deal with pain in one foot. The Speedgoat lost their grippiness way faster than expected. The Mafate is grippy, but I notice a lot of sideways slide.

1fh8ren,trailrunning,First trail run with Hoka Torrent 4‚Äôs,"Did my first proper trail run today, and first time with my new trail shoes Hoka Torrent 4. 

I‚Äôve been using Hoka Arahi 6 for my road running so far and have been getting on well with Hoka‚Äôs in general over the years. Wanted to properly get into trail running, mainly to really get in the outdoors more. My first impression of the Torrent 4‚Äôs are very good! I went for them as I didn‚Äôt have the budget just yet for the Matafe, but these are a good compromise for now. They are nice and light. Not too much cushioning so I could feel the trail more which is always good. Secure around the foot, I thought the heel section may be slightly loose but in all fairness after running with them it was absolutely fine. The grip was good, but the only thing lacking is the Vibram on the bottom. I could tell if I was on wet stone for any amount of time I might have an issue, but to be honest it wasn‚Äôt as bad as some people make out in my opinion at all. 

The most important thing is I had fun and it‚Äôs kick started my trail journey, and my experience using them was great! 

Has anyone else used these shoes? How did you find them? ",2024-09-15 09:37:53+00:00,5,4

About Me:  47yo, 6ft, 185lbs, FM 3:20, HM: 1:36: 5k: 19 Min 1mile PR: 5:20 Forefoot Striker

**OVERVIEW**:  Impulse buy at Dick's Sporting goods.  I love the Mach 6 (half size up/wide) for everyday tempos, and have been using the Cielo X1 and Superblast 2 as long run and marathon trainers.  Endorphin Speed/Pro 3 are also in my rotation.  I was hoping to pair this with the Cielo X1 as another up tempo trainer or even long run option.

**MIDSOLE:**  VERY similar to the Cielo X1.  It's fast, and really has an outstanding pop off at tempo and threshold paces.  I took it out on a 6 mile run with mixed tempos (6:30 mile, 8:30 recover paces, 7:30 tempo).  Love love love the midsole, pop, softness, and responsiveness.  Hoka has absolutely wonderful midsoles with their current iteration of shoes compared to Bondi, Clifton, et al.

**OUTSOLE:**  No complaints.  Looks like it will hold up.  Grip was great.

**UPPER:**  ***BIG PROBLEM!!!***.  After trying on in the store, I decided to go up 1/2 size as TTS was tight in my forefoot.  I also noticed that the heel was a bit loose regardless of sizes.  I've known that this is an issue with this model, but I've rarely had problems with race fits and loose heel collars.  I have the Rocket X2 which has a very similar heel collar, and I have no problems.

On my first run I could not get a decent lockdown for the life of me.  My right foot in particular began to get irritated just 2 miles into the run.  I had to repeatedly stop to adjust the laces, do a runners knot, undo the runners knot...etc.  At one point I thought I had it, but I was getting lace bite on my forefoot.  After completing the run, my right heel was completely shredded. BUMMER!!! FYI I was wearing Feetures socks with the heel tab.  These are my goto socks, so I know it wasn't a sock problem.

**CONCLUSION**:  The ride in this shoe is superb.  Maybe the best on the market that I've tried.  I would even consider this an option as a marathon racer or long run shoe.  I genuinely love the ride of this shoe.  However, this was a day 1 return.  My heel is super chafed and irritated after just one run.  Could I have kept them?  Maybe.  However, I'm not going to waste my time trying to dial in a heel lock when every other shoe I own does not have this issue.  Hopefully V3 will be the one.",2024-09-14 17:57:58+00:00,51,37
1fgiqcu,RunningShoeGeeks,Weekend Discussion: Hoka running shoes,"Happy weekend!

This is our weekend post where you can give your reviews, tell us what you hated/loved, comparisons between versions, share photos, or ask questions below for everything Hoka!",2024-09-14 10:00:45+00:00,6,16
1fg55ks,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka skyward x initial impressions,"First of all:
79kg, M21, 178cm. I dont necessarily have a single form of striking, on some runs I drop back into the heel some more, in others I run on my forefoot. 1:50 1/2 marathon, 22:30 5k

This shoe has been great for the first two runs I took them on. It was a bit of getting used to them on the first run, as they are quite big and clunky and I feel like they do want you to run in a specific manner. In my opinion these felt best when landing on the midfoot or heel and on the forefoot they are ok, but I feel like you are missing out on most of the tech (like the convex plate) when striking there. The bounce when landing right on the midfoot feels crazy and the only thing that came close to this sensation is the prime x (1 and 2).

Even though they are heavy, they feel versatile and happy at different paces. I will probably pick them for my long and steady pace runs as they feel very protective, but happy at slightly faster paces than recovery / truly easy. Also, the upper runs a bit long, but is very comfortable and for the weather right now (around 15c) it is not too hot and not too cold.

 The outsole does not have any wear yet, which is probably normal, although I have almost worn through the heel on the mach x 2 at 15k already so you can never take this for granted. However, it seems like the plate has snapped? It is particularly noticeable on the right shoe (pic 2), but the left one also shows some signs of cracking already (pic 3). I am not sure what I will do with this, probably first gonna check if it seems to impact anything as I did not notice it until I checked the outsole. I think and hope it is just the stabilizer part of the plate that is impacted and that I can continue to use them, I really see this outsole holding up for a while and the shoes felt so good.

I would never advise anyone to spend ‚Ç¨225 on a shoe for just easy runs, but if you have the cash and are willing to try something new, these are fun! Be aware of the plate potentially cracking early on though..",2024-09-13 20:50:50+00:00,78,56

1femgg8,sesamoid,Is a Lateral Sesamoidectomy Worth It?,"I‚Äôve been dealing with pain in my lateral right foot sesamoid for a year now (although my doctor believes the problem may have begun a few years ago). First diagnosed as sesamoiditis following an X-Ray, and had custom orthotics created. I‚Äôve been wearing them consistently for ~10 months now, and my pain got continuously worse, even with adjustments. Bought Hoka Bondi 8s since I heard they were good for pain relief but they didn‚Äôt help all that much. A month ago my doctor took another x-ray and diagnosed me with Avacular necrosis of my sesamoid, and we decided to give physical therapy a try. Physical therapy has helped with reducing the frequency of my pain, but when I do get pain it tends to be at a higher level. After seeing my doctor today for a follow up and getting a second opinion, the consensus is that surgery is really my only option to fully remove my pain (he ruled out injections for me).

Since I don‚Äôt have any fractures or breaks, it‚Äôs not dire for me to get surgery, and my doctor has left it up to me to choose whether or not I want to live with the pain or just remove my sesamoid. 

I‚Äôm just a high schooler so I have my whole life ahead of me really to deal with this issue, and although the pain is tolerable, I‚Äôm inclined to get the surgery because I want to be able to just do activities without thinking about potentially aggravating my sesamoid since I‚Äôm an active person. Success rates for the surgery are high and recovery seems doable.

So I‚Äôm curious, should I be reconsidering surgery or just go ahead with it? My research is telling me to just stick with my gut opinion of surgery, but I‚Äôm curious to see what people who‚Äôve been in a similar situation think.

Gradually, I could start walking on it, but only for a few hundred steps before the pain returned. Went to the doc after a few months and they said it wasn‚Äôt plantar fasciitis, instead a muscle strain or tear. Basically, the more I walk the worse the pain gets (and I can‚Äôt run). Usually the pain goes from 0/10 to 5/10 after a few hundred steps and can take a couple of weeks to get back to zero. I experience soreness and tingling around my ankle and mid foot. Weight bearing is also an issue (can‚Äôt perform a plank or balance on the left foot). I wear Hokas, eat healthy, and I try to strengthen my feet. X-rays showed no problems.

I'm searching for a comfortable and breathable sneaker to wear in the office. Ideally, I'm looking for something with good arch and heel support, in black or dark grey, with a mesh top (without any large logos).

I currently walk to work in Hoka Clifton 9 GTX, but they feel too warm to wear for 8 hours straight at the office, so I'm planning to keep a more comfortable pair at my desk to change into.

I came across the [Skechers Slip-ins: Max Cushioning Arch Fit 2.0](https://www.skechers.ca/en/skechers-slip-ins-max-cushioning-arch-fit-2.0/220565WW_BBK.html), which seem to tick all the boxes, but they're only available in extra-wide and I feel are a bit pricey at $180 CAD for my intended use.

1fdfmcb,CaminoDeSantiago,Help Needed! Hiking the Camino on 2 days notice. Am I nuts??,"Hey, Ya'll. First and foremost, thanks so much to all the contributors on this thread. It's honestly so helpful and inspiring. So here's the story;  
I've been in Edinburgh for the Fringe festival, which was an absolute slog. I performed a ton, and I've been craving some nature and peace to settle my nervous system a little.   
My beautiful aunt passed away very suddenly in 2021, and it has left a massive hole in the collective hearts of my family, particularly my mother, who lost her best friend. Hiking the Camino was one of my aunt's proudest achievements aside from her kids, and she even wrote and published a book about her pilgrimage. While reorganising my backpack, I randomly found her book tucked away in a little pocket. I'd honestly forgotten I'd put it there, but I'm treating it as a sign from the heavens that I should embark on this same adventure that brought her so much joy and peace at a time when I could use a little of that myself. It brings me great pleasure to imagine walking in her footsteps and witnessing the same sights, tastes and sounds she did.  
That being said, my time and finances are limited, and to complete the whole hike, I'll leave Barcelona on Thursday morning and get straight into it. She hiked the Camino Frances from St Pied De Port, which took her 50 days. I am a competent and resourceful traveller. I lived in South America for seven years, completed some massive hikes through the Andes and am determined to finish the full measure of the Camino as my auntie did.  
So here's where I need help from this community!

Have you ever heard the phrase, ""All the gear, no idea""? I currently have very little gear and even less of an idea! I have a good backpack and that's about it.  
  
\* My shoes are a very comfortable pair of Hoka Bondi 8's. They are not hiking shoes, but I find them very comfortable and have done some decent hikes in them so far through the Scottish countryside. I am hoping these will be sufficient! What do you guys think? I am nervous that if I buy a new pair of hiking boots, I won't have adequate time to break them in.  
  
\* I have not made any accommodation reservations, and my budget is tight. Will I be ok to wing it? I'm hoping I'm far enough beyond the busy period I won't be too troubled.

\* Does anyone have a packing list of essentials for the hike?

\*Where's a good place in Barcelona to buy decent hiking gear (jackets, pants, socks) for all weather conditions? How bad does the weather get at this time of year?

\*Is it a good idea to bring some cash on the walk? Has anyone in this group done it on a shoestring budget?

\*What about sleeping bags etc. Are these necessary?

\*I will send my big backpack from Barcelona to meet me when I complete the hike. I've sussed out a couple of options, but I would love to hear what the community thinks.

\*Is there an essential app I should download before the hike begins?

\*What did you take on the hike that you couldn't have lived without? What do you wish you had had on the hike?

I am beyond determined to get this done, so any advice you may have would be much appreciated!   
Thanks in advance, everybody. I am excited to hear from you.

1fddibn,CaminoDeSantiago,Camino primitivo and light packing list (tips for the future),"hey everyone!

i finished the Primitivo on Sunday, and I wanted to chime in for anyone interested in the future. I brought a very light packing list with a somewhat small backpack for 14 days of hiking. I saw most people bring massive bags and I didn't understand why lol.

Bag: [deuter futura 21L SL ](https://www.deuter.com/nl-nl/shop/rugzakken/p1401461-wandelrugzak-futura-21-sl)and it was not packed full! (if you see my post history i was looking for one that fit the personal item size -i didn't get checked so maybe i was lucky?)

Shoes: hoka challengers 7 wide

Clothes:

* 2 sun hoodies (very practical and saved me from having to apply and re-apply sunscreen on sunny days)
* fast drying convertible pants (never took the bottom off though)
* one pair of lycra shorts
* 2 panties from joha underwear (silk and wool)
* 2 rewoolution bras
* 2 pairs of darn tough lightweight socks
* teva sandals
* flip flops
* light pajama shorts
* one cotton shirt to sleep on/change afterwards
* microfiber towel
* cotton sleeping liner
* windbreaker
* fleece
* five panel cap

I could've done it without the teva sandals if i'm honest, and just stay with the flip flops. I would also bring a very light fleece instead of the one I brought. As for the shoes I cannot recommend trail runners enough: they dry fast, are lightweight and in the wide option my feet didn't suffer much, I didn't have any blisters and I was walking with an ankle injury of 8 months lol. I had to bring my computer as well which added 1,5 kg of weight :( so if you don't have to bring it then it makes for a very very light and small backpack, so you can hike in a more enjoyable way.

i also sweat A LOT and stink very easily, so i was washing by hand every day and taking advantage of the washing machines and dryers on the way.

that's my two cents! i hope someone can benefit from this very light packing list!!!",2024-09-10 09:10:56+00:00,15,9

1fc9wkw,FootFunction,Daily inner ankle pain for over a year without any clear diagnosis or effective treatment,"A little background: In January of 2023 I was 28 and had been running competitively for about 10 years in typical thick-soled running shoes (Asics, Hokas, Nikes, etc.) and decided to try running in Xero shoes because I'd  dealt with right hip pain several times and thought it could help take some impact force off my hips. I transitioned gradually, starting with just a couple miles a week and worked up to about 20 miles a week in July 2023 without discomfort.

Then into August I started getting some lateral left knee pain and a bit of left inner ankle pain, but nothing too painful. I cut down my mileage to about 10 mpw through October but the ankle pain started to get worse. I was also at this point wearing minimal shoes (Xero) most of the time. By mid-November '23, I developed pain in my left foot and ankle that made it hard to walk. I enrolled in physio which I did for two months, and was diagnosed with post-tib tendinitis. We did a lot of calf stretching and strengthening, inversion and eversion and dorsiflexion, and slowly ramped up mileage (although I switched back to my Hokas as running in Xero was too painful).

By Feb '24 I had some relief and could run maybe 10 mpw but walking without Hokas or a similar running shoe was now painful. I had moved cities so enrolled in another round of physio which focused more on foot strengthening and plyometric movement (after initial calf and ankle strengthening similar to the last physio) and again had some relief but not back to normal. This physio said it was extensor digitorum tendinitis.

In early summer I tried to ramp up my running but never was able to do more than 2 miles without pain lasting a few days. I finally got an MRI done in August which did not seem to show much (according to the podiatrist who ordered it) other than ""inflammation of the deltoid ligament"". He prescribed an orthotic to address this  to ""take pressure off my arch"" when I run.

I did some hiking in late August (only about 5 miles or so) and a few short runs, which seem to really have aggravated it - it's at the point now where walking or standing for more than 10 minutes is quite painful. I have a lot of pain inverting my foot. The pain seems localized in the little groove right below the inner ankle bone. I'm just becoming hopeless about it now, it feels like I will never be able to run again without pain. I'm curious to hear any of your thoughts.

I‚Äôm in good health and don‚Äôt typically have any pain when exercising. However, I‚Äôve noticed that when I run in one specific pair of shoes (new type of Asics that are highly supportive, like a Hoka), I get pain on the tops of my feet and my toes go numb.

However, I‚Äôve since moved so can‚Äôt return to that store to check in.

Does anyone have any recommendations for a new type of shoe? I have narrow feet with a normal arch, but I pronate a lot, so the running store suggested a supportive shoe.

The only sign of any progression of the condition I'd say is that my toe joint is bigger than it was and I can no longer comfortably wear trainers that I did 8 or 9 years ago, I have never tried inserts for this reason as the last thing I need is something that raises my foot closer to the top of the shoe, which brings me to my question....

I have managed it over the years mostly through footware.  I have Holka Sky Kaha hiking boots which are amazing and in terms of every day footware, have used New Balance 928 with the rocker although they are harder to get in the UK, many many pairs of 924s which have no rocker but a wide and high toe box, other wide NB,  Brooks etc and in terms of normal trainers I can still wear Airforce Ones if I remove the insole.  I tried the Hoka trainers initially and even though they were wide I always found the toe box to be too low and even at the start they pressed on my toe.  

Are there any other options that are both wide and high that I might have missed?

1fa1uqw,hiking,Shoe Issue,"So this is kind of a peculiar situation. I was hiking in Altra Lone Peaks pretty much exclusively for the past year or so. I've always had trouble finding shoes/boots that worked. On a recent hike, I ended up with three stress fractures (sesmoid and first metatarsal) and a fully ruptured Medial Collateral Ligament. Doc basically slapped my hand and told me to stop with the minimalist/zero drop style shoe and go back to something with more substance. I've tried just about everything at this point and am a total loss. Most thinner shoes put a ton of pressure right where the tear was, so I definitely need something with the wider toe box. Any recommendations? 

I've tried Topo Terraventure and Ultraventure, hoka speedgoat, merrel moab speed, keen versacore, saucony peregrine, and most of the other Altras...none of them are anywhere close to as comfortable as the Lone Peaks.

About me:  6'ft, Late 40s, 190 lbs, :20 Min 5K, 1:36 HM, 3:20 Full Midfoot Striker.  Base pace- 8:30/mile, Tempo- 7:15/mile, 5k pace- 6:30/mile ish. Recent 1mile PB- 5:18.

**OVERVIEW-**  I've been using both the Superblast 2 and Mach 6 for daily miles, tempo, and long runs.  I wanted to make this post for anyone looking for a daily trainer to highlight some of the differences, pros, and cons of each shoe.

**MACH 6 PROS-** Having put on about 50 miles thus far, I have to say I am thoroughly IMPRESSED with the Mach 6.  Having run in the Mach 5, this version is a massive upgrade.  Smooth toe off and transition...maybe the best rocker in the game.  Midsole is the perfect balance of squish and firmness.  Plenty of stack at 36mm.  Upper is easy to clean and seems durable.  Lock down is excellent.  Excels at tempo, speedwork, and even easy paces.  The midsole seems to be holding up extremely well, with zero loss of bounce or rebound (unlike other Mach 5, Clifton, Bondi...et al.  Hokas 22-23 standard models have durability issues).  Longest run so far was a 12 miler with mix paces from 5k to easy.  Handled it like a champ.  This is also a fantastic walking shoe.  I ordered a second pair in white to wear at work.  PRICE is outstanding at $140 with some stores offering various discounts for educators/healthcare workers etc.

**MACH 6 CONS-** The upper is too tight in TTS.  I love a good race fit, but I think Hoka's sizing for this model is just off.  Might be off on a few models.  I sized up in the Rocket x2 as well.  Most Hoka shoes fit a little narrow, but my TTS is also short.  Going up 1/2 size solved this.  Luckily they do offer this shoe in wide.  Hoka, if you're listening, standardize your sizes already! You make great shoes, so let us order with confidence.

**SUPERBLAST 2 PROS-** I currently am at the 100 mile mark in this shoe.  What's to be said that hasn't already been noted on Reddit a thousand times over?  The Superblast 2 has an extremely stable ride that excels at tempo paces and long runs.  The midsole provides a ton of cushion and just enough rebound to feel propulsive yet protective.  The upper fits a lot better than version 1 (too big/baggy), with a very grippy and durable outsole.  V2 is also less slappy (see below on this). Overall it's outstanding for the most part.  Also, I'm not sure what magic they are using, but this shoe is very lightweight for something so large.  This may be the secret sauce to having this shoe feel so great at pace. Asics also has a great discount program that can be found directly from their website for vets, military, and educators.  Hoka does not directly offer these.

**SUPERBLAST 2 CONS-** Don't murder me Reddit, but I still find the Superblast 2 slappy at slower tempos (for me, < 8:30/mile paces).  It's an amazing shoe, but I don't find it personally as versatile as other trainers or even carbon racers than I've used albiet a smaller sample size than other shoe geeks I'm guessing (ES3/4, EP4, Mach 5/6, Clifton 8/9, Novablast 3/4, Boston 12, Cielo X1, Rocket X2).  After some very recent long runs in the Superblast 2, and this could just be me... but I felt that the foam sort of gets flat at the 15-18 mile mark at marathon pace.  Maybe my feet are tired or I'm just too heavy lol?  Running in other long run shoes (Cielo X1/EP3) had me feeling better.

I also feel the SB2 a poor value in contrast to more readily available trainers and even race options that are in a similar price range, yet can be found in-store to be tried on.  Asics inventory management and hype machine on these models is dumb.  I think the Novablast is 80% of the Superblast 2 at a way better price point.  For $20 more, you can get the new Puma Nitro Elite, EP3/4, AP3 at discount, and whole host of other loved trainers and racers with overnight shipping lol. I've seen Vaporlfys at <$200 on sale.

**VERICT-** Honesty, both of these shoes are great and are designed with different purposes.  Pros and Cons to both.  However, I do think that the Mach 6 is a way better value for most people/non-elite runners.  The Mach 6 can handle most of what the Superblast 2 does in a faster, more nimble package at a much lower price point. That being said, If you have the funds, either shoe will be fantastic.  I'm going to go against conventional reddit love for the Superblast 2 and say I like the Mach 6 a lot more in terms of feel, foam, and versatility,.  Hoka of late is killing it with their lineup and improvements to durability and foams.  I'm still going to run the Superblast 2 into the ground, but I may use it a little less often or limit it to long runs primarily.",2024-09-04 21:01:13+00:00,83,118

1f7wvzm,AskDocs,Hypermobility and arch pain in 2 siblings,"32 yo female, Celebrex 2x/daily (new rx). Niece and cousin has a history of EDS.

I‚Äôve been suffering from foot pain for the past six years, misdiagnosed with plantar fasciitis and cuboid syndrome and I‚Äôve tried PT steroid injections every over-the-counter orthotic.

I finally advocated for an MRI and after 4 podiatrist saw a foot and ankle orthopedic surgeon and was told I have Achilles and peroneal tendinitis and tendinopathy. No PF, no cuboid syndrome. Upon assessment, he noted that I didn‚Äôt have any pain in the extrinsic muscles and tendons.

He said that hypermobility could be the cause  because where my pain is in the middle and upper part of my arch upon walking and standing. Ironically, I recently found out that my sister has the same exact pain and has been struggling with it. Her podiatrist told her he could see just up upon x-ray that she was hypermobile. I saw the same podiatrist and he was the one that diagnosed me with cuboid syndrome, but never mention hyper mobility however, through years I have come to find that I am also hypermobile through working with physical therapists and being way too bendy with a myriad of musculoskeletal symptoms (scoliosis, si joint dysfunction, hip labrum tear).

The orthopedic surgeon recommended strengthening my foot, celebrex to stop eating ibuprofen and also recommended orthotics if strengthening doesn‚Äôt help. I asked if using minimalist or barefoot style shoes would help with strengthening because I‚Äôve tried so many over-the-counter orthotics he didn‚Äôt seem convinced that getting a custom one would help but was open to me trying it before moving onto orthotics.

I‚Äôm in so much pain on a daily basis just doing daily activities, I‚Äôm a healthy weight physically active when I was at my peak, running on the elliptical, hiking, doing yoga. Even running on the elliptical hurt!

I‚Äôm recovering from ACL meniscus repair so I have even spent a long time off my feet and they still hurt when I have to get up! Crocs, Texas, men‚Äôs hoka hiking boots without the sole, and Birkenstocks are better but still hurt!

Kinda at a whits end with this. I plan to try minimalist shoes for a year while I work with my personal trainer on strength training 3x/week both my knee and entire body.

But is this common? For this pain to be related to hypermobility? Is there real treatment. ",2024-09-03 10:51:40+00:00,1,1

1f6lbmf,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Mach X 2 Launch Day Review,"I bought a pair of Hoka Mach X 2 at my local run store on Friday. Didn‚Äôt realize they weren‚Äôt released until today so figured I would share some thoughts from my first run in case anyone is interested in checking them out


About me:
34F, 120-ish pounds, 5‚Äô7‚Äù. I‚Äôve been consistently racing for about 1.5 years. Mid foot striker. Neutral unless I‚Äôm really tired then I might primate inward slightly. Also worth noting I have POTs, EDS, and hypermobility. My toe splay is wide but my foot isn‚Äôt, so I look for shoes with a wider toe box. Mostly a treadmill runner for safety because of the POTS. Currently training for both the Chicago and NYC Marathons. 


Onto the shoes:
I went into the store looking for a replacement shoe for my New Balance Supercomp Trainer V2. After 2 pairs I realized that the recurrent pain I was feeling in my hips only showed up when I wore them for long runs. I tried the Altra Fwd Experience as a replacement but they felt very ‚Äúthud‚Äù and absolutely no ‚Äúpop‚Äù. After a ton of research I was interested in trying the Hoka Mach X. The employee brought out both the first and second edition for me to try. (He also brought out the Cielo X1 to tempt me with since they only had 1 pair left in my size.) I put an X on one foot and an X2 on the other and was instantly impressed with how light and springy the X2 felt. The base of the X felt really wide (like the NB More V4) whereas the X2 felt stable without being shaped like a pyramid. I saw some concerns about the heel counter but I had no issues. Didn‚Äôt even need a runner‚Äôs loop to feel locked in. There was no question that I was going home with the X2.


Did a 17 mile long run in them yesterday. I wore balega blister resist socks and had no issues with rubbing. Heel still felt totally fine too. They were well cushioned without feeling like marshmallows. I did a fast finish and that‚Äôs when these shoes shined. The rocker shape was just enough to help me feel propelled forward while still feeling very stable, which I was grateful for on tired legs when my form may not have been 100%. They didn‚Äôt have the same springy pop as the Cielo X1 (which I also brought home, though have not yet tried outside the store) but I wasn‚Äôt worried I was going to roll an ankle inward, which seems to be a common concern. 


Sizing and comparisons:
I would say they fit true to size or a tiny bit large. I wear a 9 in walking shoes. I got these in a 9.5. I still had some wiggle room when my run was over despite my feet being a little swollen. For reference, I wear a 9.5 in the NB Supercomp Elite V3 and a 9 in the Supercomp Trainer and those have less toe room. I‚Äôm still happy with the sizing as my toes and toenails were fine.


The shape of the upper reminds me of the On Cloudmonster in all the best ways. No unnaturally pointy toe. Roomy without being clown shoe shaped.


The ride felt like running in a 75% power version of the Supercomp Elite V3. The base shapes are extremely similar with the Mach X 2 being just slightly taller and with a 1mm higher drop. 


I never thought I would be a Hoka fan, but I think these shoes may have converted me. My only gripe is the color. I‚Äôm not usually a white shoe fan, but the black and orange was giving Halloween.  ",2024-09-01 18:26:28+00:00,114,35

1f6aif4,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Cielo x1 50km thoughts ,"M 6.2 87kg HM 1:27 Mar: 2:58 
Mainly a trail ultra runner but enjoy hitting the tarmac every so often. 
Other shoes in my rotation On cloud surfer, Hoka Mach 6, Saucony Pro 3, NB 1080 v12 

Crossed over the 50km mark in the Cielo (at 73km to be exact) and think I have a decent opinion on these shoes. 

A specific work out I did in this shoe to test it at different paces was (all paces in min/km): 
25km Total - 5km at 5:40, 5km at 4:45, 5km at 4:30, 5km at 4:15, 5km at 3:55

Upper: comfortable, booty stile, more material than typical race day shoe up hasn‚Äôt been an issue for me. 
Midsole: super bouncy, great energy return, very comfortable

If I had to sum this shoe up in one sentence it would be: a long run beast. 

I bought this shoe as I have a race weekend coming up where is a double marathon, so essentially the Saturday is the trail marathon and then the Sunday is the road. There a challenge to compete in both which I will be doing. I wanted a road shoe that was very cushioned yet had some pop and energy return to help the legs on Sunday. 
It will definitely be used for this but the more I have used the shoes the more I keep wanting to reach for it every run. 
I will touch on likes/dislikes below but I think if you are looking for a maximal style shoe, with lots of bounce, good amount of cushion and a comfortable easy ride I would definitely recommend. 

Likes: 
very comfortable on the foot. Find the upper is a little more structured and padded vs your classic race day shoe (which does add weight but adds comfort so depends what you looking for). Have run in warmer temperatures and haven‚Äôt had any issues with it but hasn‚Äôt been any extreme heat so maybe someone else can comment on that). 
One thing I would raise is the kneel is pretty raw with not much cushion. I haven‚Äôt had any issues with rubbing or pain but could potentially see some people struggling with them.

A very smooth ride at any pace - from the work out above it could easy handle each of those paces with no problem. 

A wide base so overall very stable despite being such a high stack shoe (I will say that when you initial try them on/walk in them they feel pretty unstable but once you get running it becomes more firmer and overall very stable. 

Dislikes
In all honesty non really. Have really loved the shoe. Maybe the weight if had to pick one but will touch on that below. 

Finally the 2 big things I see people talk about constantly with this shoe and my opinion. 
1) the laces - they fine for me, haven‚Äôt had any issues. But if you worried about them just replace them. Not a reason not to get the shoe
2) the weight - a bit more here. Now in truth I actually haven‚Äôt struggled to much with the weight. At any of the paces I‚Äôve run it‚Äôs handled them absolutely fine. Holding the shoe in your hand you can maybe tell it‚Äôs slightly heavier but on the foot didn‚Äôt really notice it. I think if I was racing a 10km or Half (maybe even an all out marathon) I would probably use my Pro 3, BUT that would be based on my mental thoughts of knowing it‚Äôs a lighter shoe. On the foot i don‚Äôt really notice it much. I see a lot of people wanting a lighter v2 version which I understand so will be interesting to see what they do with it. Personally I understand it affects the elites but for me at my level it doesn‚Äôt really matter. The weight is fine, and you benefit from that extra weight in other areas (long lasting shoe, more comfortable, more stack etc). So depends what you looking for. 

Final thoughts and whose it for: 
Durability- only 70km in but noticed no issues or wear and tear. Could see this should lasting a long time. No change in bounce or energy return either which is good. 

Price: ¬£250 here in the UK - ouch. Tbh I think it‚Äôs worth it (could easily take the place of 2 shoes in your rotation). But I think a price closer to ¬£220 would be nicer to see. 

How I will be using it: mainly a long run shoe and certain races. It‚Äôs so comfortable, great for those long runs and protects your legs extremely well. Will be a great addition there. Will be very happy with these on any start line if I didn‚Äôt have another pair (even if I pick these over the pro 3 I‚Äôll be happy so no issues). 

Whose it for: 
I think this would work for a few different people. 
1) experienced runners who have a few carbon shoes and are looking for a carbon plate option to use on long runs that have work outs in them. Or runners who are looking for a higher stack bounce monster as a race day option (choosing between these, alfaflys and Mizuno Wave pro I would guess). 

2) someone looking for their first carbon shoe. I think this would work really well for that.

3) now definitely a rouge thought but I also think this could be a do it all/single shoe rotation shoe. Now it certainly wouldn‚Äôt be my first choice but if you were looking at it for that I think it could definitely work. 

Anyway happy to answer any questions! 
Edit: I‚Äôm for mid foot striker.

1f62teo,trailrunning,"Talk me off the ledge: 2 weeks from my first trail ultra, the ""new"" shoes are proving to be a disaster, so I just bought two new pair to try and I can't imagine this is going to end well.","So here's the story:  On the 14th of September, I'm running the Plain 100, which is an unsupported ultra in the Cascades of Washington state.  Several significant climbs (couple thousand feet per segment) on rough or rocky terrain. No gear drop until mile 67, which is also the end of the 100k.  This is my first ultra distance.  The climbs aren't a particular issue for me, even at my age (I'm not young) but I only generally know the terrain.  Also, because of a unique situation, I'm free to run the 100M or the 100k.  The race director just wants me in the race.

For years, for the trail I've been running Saucony Xodus models and VERY happy.  But the last remaining ""current"" pair (Xodus 6) has an unknown number of miles on it and I was worrying about them getting me through the race.  I do also have a pair of Goretex Excursion TR12.  I talked to a store rep who knows trail running and he recommended the Xodus Ultra 2, which then got and have been training with for maybe 6-7 weeks.

They are turning out to be not stable for me.  I have done a bunch of A-B running where I run the exact same course one day with the old Sauconys and then the next session with the Ultra 2.  I am catching edges and rolling my ankles a LOT in the Ultra 2, but not much at all on the old Sauconys.  My training run yesterday was the last straw.  An easy 5 miles and by half way through I was worried I was going to get injured due to all the ""catches"".

I believe this experience is primarily because the Ultra 2 is visibly narrower at the bottom (tread) than any of my previous Xodus models, and even a touch rounded.  On windy trails I now suspect it's more prone to roll over the edge onto it's side (what I first thought was it ""catching"").  I have confidence in this being at least part of the issue as I don't have problems on ""pure"" rocky stuff like running up the railroad grade (typically a mile or so of straight ahead running), but when I get to the twists and turns and moving over/around roots and rocks on the trail, it will happen at least 3-4 times in those few forest miles.

So first thing this morning, I went to a local running store with a good reputation (and they've done well for me with road shoes.)  The rep was not a trail runner but seemed familiar enough to asks the right questions, look at my shoes and compare them, and select a few shoes to try.  One thing that I mentioned to him was my belief that a beefy rock plate was a requirement (the Xodus has convinced me of this.)   The did not have any Saucony trail shoes.  We ended up with the Brooks Cascadia 18 and the Hoka Stinson 7 (which feels ""tall"").  I bought both because I didn't feel like I had other options at this point and he pointed out that they have a 30 day return policy.

I got home and was trying to decide which shoe to take out this afternoon to start gaining some confidence and discovered that the one I like slightly more from a feel and movement standpoint, the Hoka Stinson 7, doesn't have a rock plate. This bummed me as I am now wondering if this shoe will be a problem.  The Cascadia fit is much closer than the Hoka, which could be a heat/sweat/blister issue, but my past good experience with the Brooks line for road and winter trail running had me feeling good about these two shoes.  At the moment, I'm uncertain enough that I'm actually considering using the Xodus 6, maybe just swapping a fresh insole into it.

And now I'm wondering if my better answer is ""neither"" and trying to lay my hands on the Peregrine 14, or possibly the Endorphin Trail (I run the Endorphin Shift on the road for my longer (15+ Mi) distances.)

I am hoping for some advice here so I can get to a good solution and get off the ledge.

Update: Thank you to everyone for the advice. It helped me a lot. I'm off the ledge and enjoying a beer now.

I'm going to plan to run in the Xodus 6 and look at some of the suggested shoes for the future.",2024-09-01 01:23:40+00:00,13,17
1f5y6n8,XXRunning,Help with shoes,"I bought a pair of Hoka Clifton 9s later year and was very pleased with them. I had no issues whatsoever. In fact, a small but persistent pain went away when I switched to the Clifton 9s. I'm about a quarter of the way through another marathon training block and I thought it would be wise to buy another pair. So I went online and picked out another pair of Clifton 9s in the same size. 

Two weeks later and my feet, especially my two little toes on both feet, are deeply bruised. My feet are in so much pain and I realized that it's my new shoes. I thought that maybe I was still adjusting but it's very clear to me that I can't use these shoes anymore. I returned them (thank goodness for the REI's return policy). And while I'm thankful to not be out $160, I'm still in need of shoes. What do I do? Do I just buy another pair and test it out? How have you all navigated buying the correct shoe?

1f5cccw,FootFunction,Foot Function in Peroneal Tendonitis,"
Hello! This might be a bit long. I attached some pics for context and measurements.

Some background:
I am a novice runner struggling with peroneal tendonitis. Five months ago I had my first encounter with the issue and it was rather acute - I was unable to walk for longer than 2 blocks and certainly could not run. The initial onset happened during/after a 10 mile tempo in new shoes (Hoka Clifton 9) - at the time I was at ~35 mpw.

After wearing a boot and stationary biking for 2 months, I graduated to stairmaster. After a month on the stairmaster I graduated to walk-jogging on the treadmill. A month later I am finally back to about 85-90% function and comfort, but struggling to reach 100%. I‚Äôm doing around 10-15mpw on the road and treadmill and trying to take it reallllyy slow. 
I am doing PT - I find nerve glides and peroneal isometric holds help the most.
I‚Äôm also working on strengthening my hips and calves while trying to make sure my calves don‚Äôt get too tight.

So I‚Äôve been trying to familiarize myself with my foot mechanics so I can more confidently pick the right footwear for my feet. I noticed that my foot/ankle collapses inwards on impact - looks to be very mild overpronation (I think?). Interestingly, the wear on my shoes is on the inside of the heel and outside of the toe box, which doesn‚Äôt match what the internet says is common with overpronation. 

All this to ask:
- Does my pronation look to you folks to be actual overpronation OR a totally normal amount of pronation? 
- Is it possible or likely that this pronation is contributing significantly to my tendonitis?
- Any tips for peroneal tendonitis given my background?
- I‚Äôm probably not gonna touch the Hola Cliftons again. I‚Äôve heard other people say they may have caused their peroneal tendonitis as well. Any shoe recommendations? I think my calves are strong enough for 4-6mm drop.

Thank you SO much for any feedback or guidance you can offer. I know this was a longer read - so, if you read, thanks.

1f55rh2,sesamoid,Knee issues?,"Has anyone experienced knee issues on the same side as their injured sesamoid?  Maybe from a change of gait?

For background, my sesamoid has been in a state of avascular necrosis for 3-4 years.  It's never hurt me that much--there's a slight, annoying pain whenever I step on it--so my doctors advised that I shouldn't take it out.  I'm not a runner so I'm not concerned about running long distances, and I wear Hokas and/or a dancer's pad when I have to walk a lot.

But the problem is, I've changed my gait to avoid putting pressure on the right sesamoid.  For the last 3-4 years, I've been walking with more pressure on the outside of my foot (lateral).  Recently, I started having knee pain on the same side.  An MRI showed chondrosis on the lateral knee--essentially, my cartilage is breaking down.  I've never injured my knee, I'm not a runner, and I'm in my early 30s.  I can't imagine how I could have gotten this knee injury, other than my weird gait as a result of the sesamoid.  I do have an autoimmune condition, but my doctor said the knee issue looks to be mechanical, not inflammatory.

Now, I'm again considering whether I should remove the sesamoid.  Even though it's not hurting me that much, I don't want it to cause issues in other parts of my body.  Just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience.

1f53xve,PlantarFasciitis,Is it PF or Metatarsalgia or both?,"I have had foot pain for over 2 months and have an appointment with a Podiatrist. My primary thinks it PF but after seeing a massage therapist/PT he says I am super tight right below my toes. This is causing my toes to feel tight. I don't really have pain in my heel.

I have pain in my mid foot in both feet. It is pretty much a dull ache and is constant. My toes especially my big toe hurts in my new shoes I bought. I feel like the inserts my friend gave me who works at a shoe store do not provide enough cushion in the midfoot.

I had cortisone shots in both feet at a different Physical Therapy place and it did nothing to reduce the pain and inflammation.

It is hard to walk so don't do a lot of that. I wear the Hoka Cliftons and they feel good in the heel but not in the middle. They also did a test for Mortens Neuroma and did not think I had that and also did not think neuropathy. I cannot take Ibuprofron for the pain since am on blood thinners for a clot in my lung and Tylenol does not help.

1f3rwkd,RunningShoeGeeks,Saucony Guide 17 First Run,"Paid: 220 AUD On RunnerInn
Fit TTS, slightly wider than past Saucony (Peregrine)
Drop: 6mm
Stack 35/29
Run: 7.5k jog-walk, flat, dry. Slow AF.
Modifications: Custom foam orthotics 


Background: I got sick with covid or something similar two years ago and had an autoimmune flare: posterior tibial tendinopathy and some left sided arch collapse. Stability shoes offered pain free running almost immediately and saved my running. I bought the Guide 17 as I still use stability offerings for a fair bit of my daily k‚Äôs. Also, to be honest, because I buy too many shoes and it had been a while. I have found my go to stability-daily, the Arahi, has felt firmer and firmer even in shoes from the same series. I actually have gone back and tested concurrent pairs (two pairs I have at my job, and one at home) and they really have become firmer and have lost the bottomless Hoka squish that I loved. So these were a new option, and a less prescriptive approach to stability.

I am dealing with tendon issues again following covid a few weeks ago, so did a jog-walk alternating 200m on/off. Walk at 11min/mi (7:00/km) pace and then jog at a bit under 8:50/mi (5:30/km). So‚Ä¶SLOOOOOOW. 

Fit: TTS for length. I usually think of saucony as a lower volume, very narrow fit but these accept more volume and the toebox is wider. They took my orthotics and still had tons of room. Fit was ok through midfoot but pretty loose up front. Comfortable. 

Upper: Mesh. It‚Äôs hot here in Australia already and these were warm. I used a thick sock and will see later how I go in a thinner one. I‚Äôm guessing they‚Äôre toasty. They‚Äôre stretchy. Laces stretchy, perfect length. 

Midsole: These look massive, but the stack is 35/29 with high sidewalls. It‚Äôs ‚Äúsoft-firm‚Äù. The firmness doesn‚Äôt feel harsh, but not particularly bouncy, AT ALL. I used my orthotic and I bet with the Saucony supercritical insole they are more springy. But not with my boring orthotics.

Geometry: WIDE. They look like a ton of shoe underneath. High sidewalls. Wide waist. I suppose if aircraft carriers are stable the same approach works here. Rockered and pretty stiff, as reflected in the ride. I was looking for that, so, bonus. 

Outsole: Front and back have some rubber. Rest is exposed midsole foam. Not sure if it‚Äôs ‚Äúrubberised‚Äù or not. I have found keeping exposed midsole shoes clean by washing after each run extends their life for ages as it removes the small abrasives that work their way in and grind them down. Everyone here disagrees with me for recommending this but it works. 

Ride: Dense, soft, and firm. The landings feel soft and smooth, landing on a flat foot or forward is one of the sweetest transitions I‚Äôve had in ages on a daily trainer. Landing on the heel feels less smooth. They overwhelmingly seem to want to push you forward, in a good way. I read a review that said the rockered ride is ‚Äú‚Ä¶what I‚Äôm always looking for from Hoka but never quite get‚Äù and that seems accurate to me. They also feel super centered. 

I would say that if I were having a tib post flare, I‚Äôd prefer the Hoka Arahi 6 even in its current firmer iteration. The Guide seems stable, wide and safe, but lacks the prescriptive element I look for that‚Äôs specific to my recurring injury pattern. So I‚Äôd wear this when healthy or going long to keep me centered and stable, but there is still a role‚Ä¶for me‚Ä¶for medial based stability solutions that slow pronation velocity and extent WHEN INJURED. When healthy or with an injury pattern that doesn‚Äôt necessitate older, medial biased interventions, I will really enjoy these new Guide 17‚Äôs. ",2024-08-29 02:43:11+00:00,72,23

These are all pretty expensive I hope someone can steer me in the right direction I dont want to regret any purchases :( Might have to take the jump soon though. 


I hear so many good things about Hoka i‚Äôm just worried the cushioning is going to be too much, i hear some say it is too heavy or makes them lose balance. 

My feet are super sensitive so Im looking for some good support. Something comfortable and durable. If anyone has tried any of these and have an opinion on them, or if i shouldn‚Äôt get one of these please let me know!!!! ",2024-08-29 01:35:14+00:00,2,3
1f3q37k,beginnerrunning,I need shoe recs for my first marathon!,"I am in the market for some new shoes for my first marathon! I‚Äôve been running a little bit over a year now and hit my stride about 6 months ago. I am about 6 weeks out and running 16 miles as my max. 

I am looking for a new set of shoes for the marathon. I am open to getting two sets (training/race day) if recommended as well. 

I prefer bouncy but soft shoes as I am a heavy runner (230lbs 105Kg) I also have big feet and wear a size 14 US. Not all running shoes are an option for me due to the size

I want something different as what I‚Äôve tried as I have had issues currently:

Nike Zoom Fly 3- hate them for long runs. Super fast for a 5k but still not enjoyable to run in.

ASICS gel nimbus 25- I‚Äôve been through 2 pairs. Great shoes but I‚Äôve lost 4 toenails because of them‚Ä¶. And I can‚Äôt half size up

Hoka Clifton 9- favorite shoe so far in comfort. But I miss the bounce from the ASICS and then power of the plate in the Nikes.

Just wanted to see if anyone had good recommendations?

Thanks runners!!!",2024-08-29 01:15:01+00:00,1,6
1f3n0z1,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Mach X2 First Run,"I took the Mach X2 out for a first run this morning and really enjoyed them. I ordered them from REI over the weekend and received them yesterday. I think they‚Äôre the only online retailer that has them available before the official launch date.

I‚Äôve enjoyed Hoka‚Äôs line this year. The Skyward X is one of my favorite shoes this year and am enjoying the Skyflow recently.

The Mach X2 feels more nimble than the Skyward X and Skyflow and the forefoot rocker works really well with my foot strike as a forefoot striking supinator.

My first run was a progressive run and it felt good at all paces but shined as I picked up the pace. My only concern was the heel counter. It‚Äôs pretty minimal and didn‚Äôt feel great when I put on the shoes but I didn‚Äôt notice it once I started the run.

I didn‚Äôt run in the first version of this shoe but I think Hoka did a great job with this one",2024-08-28 22:51:58+00:00,34,52
1f3hf1x,cna,CNA or server assistant in fine dining?,"I'm a CNA, but the stress of the job is affecting my mental and physical health. I got offered a job as a server assistant at a fine dining restaurant, and I don't know if I should take it. I love what I do as a CNA, but when it's a bad day it's bad- I've been working there for 2 months now and I barely drink any water during my whole 12 hour shift. I start nursing school in January, so I would have to quit my CNA job by then anyways because I won't be eligible to apply to work contingent by then yet (and I've heard most people get denied anyways). I was thinking I could build my way up from a server assistant to a server, so that by the time nursing school starts I can make really good money working once a week. At the same time, I feel I've already invested a lot mentally in learning vitals, etc, and financially (scrubs, hokas) to quit being a CNA. And there will be a pay cut quitting that job for the time being until I'd get promoted to a server role. You can clearly tell I'm completely torn.

1f3daun,trailrunning,Julian Alps Trail Run - 50K - shoe choice,"Hi all,

in a little more than three weeks I will run my first ultra - the Julian Alps Sky Trail in Kranjska Gora, covering 53km (33miles) with 2700 meters of vertical gain.

I have raced the 25K event last year and loved it so much that I decided to tackle my first ultra there as well. 

Now that the event approaches fast, I am naturally starting to overthink things. I am especially unsure about what shoes to wear.

My two main choices are the HOKA Tecton X 2 (faster but higher stack and shallower lugs) and the Salomon S / LAB Genesis (deeper lugs, better suited to more diverse terrain but possibly a tad bit slower).

Both pairs are quite fresh. If it rains cats and dogs in Slovenia I would also bring a beefier shoe just to be safe. For the 25K last year I wore the Nnormal Kjerag and it was the perfect choice. Its lugs are also only 3mm but it's just so agile that it doesn't matter. For my first 50K effort I think the Kjerag is too minimal though. Also, the 50K route is supposed to be quite different than the 25K (elevation profile in the pic).

Any tips are more than welcome, especially from folks who have run that particular distance at the JAT.

Thanks, fellow runners.

P.S.: I know that what counts much more than my shoe choice is the training I did. Please be assured that I covered that aspect as well as I possibly could this year.",2024-08-28 15:36:12+00:00,3,9
1f2z1ps,RunningShoeGeeks,Puma mag max initial thoughts - big cat bounce ,"
I‚Äôm 6‚Äô0"", 190 pounds, and my stride varies from midfoot to forefoot, depending on how my Achilles is feeling. I‚Äôve had issues with my Achilles‚Äîpartially tearing my left one after my first half marathon in 2023 and dealing with a flare-up in my right one this year. With physical therapy being a big part of my routine, I‚Äôm currently running over 30 miles a week.

First Run: Fit and Feel  
The Puma Mag Max fits like a glove‚Äîin a good way. I usually experience slippage with brands like Nike and Hoka, possibly due to my right foot being shaped differently or slightly shorter than my left. But with the Mag Max, that wasn‚Äôt an issue at all.

The upper is super plush, and the tongue is just thick enough‚Äîsoft without being overly padded. I tied a runner's knot, and it didn't put uncomfortable pressure on the top of my foot like some other shoes do. There was also zero heel slippage, which is always a relief.

The laces are a bit short, but I actually prefer that. I can‚Äôt stand when laces tap against my Coros foot pod during a run.

The Outsole and Midsole  
As usual with Puma, the outsole delivers. I heard that satisfying squeak while walking around indoors, which signaled solid grip. The outsole also offers good coverage, so I expect it to hold up well over time.

The midsole is plush and forgiving but still has enough density for a nice rebound. The balance here is just right‚Äîit feels responsive without compromising on comfort.

The Run  
This shoe reminded me of when I first got serious about running again in 2021 with the Hoka Bondi. I haven‚Äôt run faster in a training shoe than I did in the Bondi 6‚Äîmy mile PR is still in that shoe. The Mag Max gives off a similar vibe, just giving back whatever you put into it. It‚Äôs bouncy in a way that I really like.

My first run in the Mag Max was a 40-minute easy run, and it felt great. Today, I picked up the pace a bit while keeping my heart rate below 155, and I was cruising‚Äîfelt glorious. The landings were plush, and the upper and midsole worked together to support my stride. I tried out different landings, from heel to forefoot, and when I got up on my forefoot, the shoe rolled right over, smooth as anything.

Final Thoughts  
I‚Äôm excited to make this shoe my main daily trainer. I‚Äôve been using the Mizuno Wave Rider 28 because of its super high drop, but now it‚Äôll be the Pumas, the Mizunos, the Brooks Hyperion 2 GTS, and the Pegasus in my rotation as I prep for the Staten Island Half. Race day, I‚Äôll be in the AlphaFly 3, but the Mag Max is going to be crucial for getting me there.

I‚Äôve already logged a 40-minute easy run and a 1:20 run that was supposed to stay easy, but I ended up pushing it to the upper bounds of Zone 2, almost into tempo pace. This shoe is just fun to run in, plain and simple. I‚Äôm excited to see how it holds up as I rack up more miles.",2024-08-28 02:17:19+00:00,90,38

I am doing my first half marathon looking at finishing around 1hour44 doing 8minute miles.

I have trained in both the ride 17 and hoka mach 5 and find them both really comfortable for all types of runs, long , easy, tempo. I prefer the mach 5 for faster runs and done a 5k race in them at just over 21minutes

I bought a pair of puma deviate nitro elites 3s for my half marathon but hated them after the one run, i have a weak ankle after football injuries and they didn't feel stable enough with that and it was as if my ankle was stiff and wasn't able to flex as it should causing discomfort. Also causing pain in sole of my other foot and felt my knees weren't going to agree with the carbon plate also had knee injuries from football.

Anyway i really like my ride 17s for comfort and feet always feel stable in them so i might go with these for the half marathon or buy a new pair for it but i was just wondering if there are any alternatives people would suggest.

1f1ec3a,RunningShoeGeeks,New Balance 880 v14 - 300 Mile (482 km) Review,"Hey RunnningShoeGeeks,

I haven't seen much on this subreddit about the NB 880 v14 (understandably) so I figured I would post up my long term review of them.

About me: 175cm (5' 9""), 72kg (\~160 Lbs), hobby jogger that averages about 50-60 miles a week (80-96 km) per week. Foot strike varies from rear mid-foot to forward heel (depending on pace).

How I have used this shoe? It's been used as an all around workhorse for me. I use it to absorb the bulk of my weekly milage via daily runs, but have also used it as my primary long run shoe, a mild-trail shoe, and even have used it for a good bit of speed work. The longest run I've taken it on is 18 miles (29 km) of mixed tarmac and trail and despite this being the high-stack super shoe ""speed"" era, the 880 v14 holds my 5k PR (though the shoe does get a bit squirrely once you drop below 5:50/mile pace).

Fit/Upper: The shoe fits quite snugly and the lockdown provided by the upper is great. I have quite a narrow foot (just shy of a D-width) and have had no issues with slippage; typically I struggle to find shoes that fit because of this. Though, if you are a wide-footed individual you will likely need to order a true wide size. The upper has held up well over my 300(+) miles that I've ran in the shoe (no holes) and is only starting to show signs of wear on the heel padding at \~330 miles in. Breathability could definitely be improved, but for a traditional daily trainer I think it delivers a product on par with competitors.

Performance: Given that it is a traditional daily trainer, the shoe performs decently well at just about anything; it's not a shoe that is going to leave one with a thought of, ""Wow! That was an incredible ride!"" after a run, but I think the super power of this shoe is that it really isn't overly prescriptive in any way. If you are looking for a shoe that just melts away during a run this is a wonderful fit. The absence of aggressive geometry/plate, lower stack height, and a wide base contribute to a stable ride, letting you focus on running without any extra mental effort. The FreshFoamX compound used, for me, strikes the perfect balance between compliance and responsiveness; it is soft enough to feel comfortable for any distance and provides an excellent level of protection with decent energy return (for a traditional daily trainer). I live in the Pacific Northwest of the United States where it is quite rainy and have had zero issues with wet-weather performance; outsole rubber grip has been great compared to my experiences with Saucony or Hoka shoes, but sits a small-tier below PumaGrip or Adidas Continental Rubber.

Durability: The 880 v14 is designed to be a workhorse of a shoe and it definitely lives up to standard well. I'm currently at about 330 miles (531 km) of usage on the shoe and can easily see myself taking this pair to more than 400 miles. As is expected with a high-milage shoe, the exposed foam on the outsole does wear with time, but the level of wear isn't nearly as extreme when compared to my experiences with experiences with other brands (Hoka, namely). The foam has compressed over time, but it's retained its soft feeling very well and hasn't yet turned into a brick; I'd imagine with continued use this will eventually happen, though. Outsole rubber coverage still is plenty grippy and will likely outlast my (running) usage of the shoe.

Overall thoughts:

This is an excellent shoe that I will re-purchase and continue to use as a daily driver. While it isn't as exciting as many of the options available today, it is extremely reliable and works with just about any pace, on most terrains.

1f0lrem,beginnerrunning,Am I overthinking running? ,"Hiyo, I‚Äôve been running since the beginning of June and I am a 26 F who has never done any sort of long distance running in her life except for soccer and we would only do a half a mile. I am about 150 lbs and would say I‚Äôm fairly decent shape. I work in the hospital and am on my feet all day long (4-5k steps min per shift). 
My first concern is my heart rate. It gets to around 175 and will drop to about 145-155 range when I‚Äôm walking but in instances where I don‚Äôt run and just walk I am about 110. After running for more than 12 weeks I‚Äôm not sure why it won‚Äôt go down? I am just wondering if anyone else experiences a heart rate that is generally higher than others after a while of running 3-4 times a week. 
The other concern is pain. I know sore muscles from lifting and soccer but this running pain is in places like my knees where I‚Äôve never had issues. I try running at a high cadence and staying on my midsole rather than heel striking (too much of a change cause leg cramping and shin pain). The whole time I‚Äôm running I‚Äôm trying to focus on making sure I‚Äôm breathing good, fists not clenched, shoulder not raised, core is somewhat engaged, not heel shrinking. But I almost feel like I‚Äôm changing every second and if I run how is comfortable my cadence is awful and I am out of breath. My calves ache going up stairs my knees hurt and I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs sore or actual overuse pain because my knees have never hurt. It‚Äôs mostly along the outer edges and under kneecap. I switched from road to tread and the first week the pain reduces but now it‚Äôs back again.
I was running in Hoka Bondi 8 but then switched to Brooks Glycerin 21. They feel good so I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs a shoe problem. 
Any advice helps especially if I am overthinking it!

This wasn't a problem always, but started some months ago. Does anyone know what might be causing this?

1ezjojm,PlantarFasciitis,How I fixed/treated my plantar fasciitis ,"This is my personal experience and journey to getting over plantar fasciitis (PF). Keep in mind everyone is different and I am no podiatrist or physical therapist. Bear with me, it's a complicated issue so this is long, but you can skip to whatever sections interest you. Hope this helps at least 1 person 

First, watch this video. Best video I found 
https://youtu.be/d6dBXCxvLk4?si=WUydlUb9TwOkdYxm

Background: 
I'm a 35 year old 5'6"" 120 lb male, not overweight by any means. Active daily (weights 2x/week, run a mile in ~6 min 2x/week, walk/jog several miles all other days, body weight circuit exercise 1x/week). Walk 15-20k steps daily at work 

Possible causes and start of PF: 
Unclear. No change to my exercise routine in years. Been working the same job for 5 years, so daily step count hasn't changed much. It may have been my shoes and/or age. I don't drag my feet so my shoes retain good traction for years. At work, I was wearing Clark's business casual dress shoes that were ~5 years old lol. I'm guessing this was the cause. Outside of work, I wore a variety of Nikes but mostly a ~1.5 year old Nike Pegasus 38 that has logged a lot of miles over that time and was probably due for replacement 

Timeline:
1. April: start of PF, did not realize at first since it was just discomfort rather than pain and my first steps in the morning were not painful 
2. May: finally realized it was PF since it has not improved, just lingered. Did not formally get it diagnosed, but it's obvious and didn't think it'd make a difference in treatment. Replaced all my shoes to new Nikes (Pegasus 39/40s, Infinity RN4). Wore shoes all the time 
3. June: started wearing Hoka Clifton 9 at work and started stretching daily 
4. July: started wearing ""Strassburg"" type sock at night   
5. August: 3rd week of wearing sock 80%
healed, 4th week 90% healed
6. Sept: healed 

What I learned:  
1. PF is very common. More people have it than you think, they just don't talk about it, healed, or just learned to deal with it on a daily basis. Didn't know of a single person who had it until I started talking about it and now I know over 10 people who have it 
 2. Personal opinion, but seeing a podiatrist or Physical therapist (PT) doesn't seem to be a necessity. I know someone who spent months doing PT and still has PF for about 2 years now. I even know a PT who has PF right now. I work in a hospital and asked several PT coworkers for advice and I didn't find any of it very helpful or use any of it as part of my recovery. I feel like all the tools we need can be found with good research. Most people I know saw both specialists and still have PF today 
 3. Don't quote me on this, but in my opinion and from my research, anything you do directly to the PF (rolling a ball or cold water bottle, massage, etc) is only for temporary relief and will not fix the issue. You need to address root cause  
 4. Recovery time highly varies from person to person. Be patient. You can't rush this. I know people who got over it in 1-2 weeks and also people who had it for several months or even years 
 5. Don't cheap out on shoes and replace as appropriate. I think we've all heard it is better to spend money on good shoes than to suffer and spend even more money on medical treatment. Heard this before, but never took it seriously. All shoes have a ""mileage"" before replacement, regardless of tread condition 

Treatment (ranked from effectiveness): 
1. Strassburg sock (or anything that keeps the ankle at min of 90 degrees). Get this asap and wear it when you sleep. I feel like all the stretching and orthotics just maintained my PF status, it wasn't noticeably healing until I started wearing this. I know someone who healed in 1 week from wearing this early on. Also know of someone who just pushed the bottom end of his bed against a wall and slept with his feet flat against the wall at a 90 degrees. Neither of those 2 people did any stretching and healed quick
2. Stretch. I followed the YouTube video by athlean-x - how to fix plantar fasciitis. Did the calf stretch and hip thrust 5-10 times daily. Calf stretch might be the most effective 
3. Orthotics. Get shoes with good support and wear them even in the house. Avoid going barefoot. Replace old shoes when it's time. Hoka Clifton 9 are the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. Their just expensive and don't look that great lol 
4. Rest. This may be the hardest part since my guess is most people who get PF are very active. It's like a death sentence for us. Walk less and avoid standing in place, I think it's worse than walking. Stop running. Running definitely exacerbated the condition. Find alternate cardio (I did cycling instead).

1exvl2i,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Tecton X3 first impressions,"**Total distance ran:**

12 miles (19 km)

**Type of run:**

Forest trails

**Weather ran in:**

Rainy, 65F

**My profile:**

50M, running 40-45mpw mixed roads and trails

**Positives:**

* Slightly more traction than Tecton 2
* Slightly more cushion than Tecton 2

**Negatives:**

* Pricey
* Built-in gaiter is polarizing

**Overview:**

I did my first run in these over the weekend (12 miles on forest trails). The overall fit and feel is very similar to the X2, however the soles are a little stiffer and there's a bit more cushion - which made running on gravel, rocks and roots much more comfortable. The tread feels a little more aggressive as well. I felt extremely stable, even on hairy terrain. I was not initially enamored with the built-in gaiter, but it turned out to be really functional. Overall, a nice improvement on the X2. 

**Worth buying?:**

They're expensive, but good. I plan on using them for my upcoming 50k.

1exqkdy,trailrunning,PEBA or TPU Insoles?,"Hello there!

I am large footed human and am having trouble sizing a new pair of Hoka Tecton X3. I bought 13 originally but the right foot is too close to the front for comfort, despite wearing a 13 in everything Hoka including Mafate Speed 4 (my daily trail trainer). The toe box is much more accommodating than the X2, which I couldn't wear, but it still feels short. As there is no 13.5, I ordered a 14 to see if that might work but of course I'm worried that it's going to be TOO big. I'm thinking of replacing the insoles to take up some volume and also to give some arch support. I pronate slightly so I think the insoles will help in general with such a bouncy shoe.

That's a long way of asking if there is an insole that you might recommend that would be a good match with a PEBA trail shoe. Extra support than stock would be great, but also I'm thinking about weight and water retention. I'm familiar with Inov-8 Boomerang but I've never tried them myself. Heard they're a little heavy but that might not matter too much if they fit the bill elsewhere. Of course there's Curex and Superfeet, and Sidas seems to have custom trail running insoles but they're hard to find.

Looking forward to your suggestions and thank you!",2024-08-21 14:08:20+00:00,1,3
1ewshuw,hiking,Autumn/Winter low cut shoes dilemma...,"Yes, it's another cry for help regarding shoes advice (sorry). I just can't make up my mind as there are so many brands with THE BEST shoes and sci-fi technologies. Ok, long story short...

I am looking for PERFECT shoes for Autumn/Winter months in a **""low"" cut**.

Mainly for **walking in the city** and **occasionally very intense/fast walks in the forest and rare mountain hikes** (hills rather). I am looking for warm-ish shoes with good breathability and soles (flexibility would be nice). Waterproofness/water resistance (Gore-tex?) would be great as in the place I live, (Poland) Winters are rather cold and wet/snowy but insulation is not a must as I do own few pairs of quite warm merino socks.

Also, I know that I should try on all the shoes first, but I would like you to help me with technical aspects first. And when my list will have 3-4 pairs I will try them and see which pair fits me perfectly.

1ew4hww,RunningShoeGeeks,Saucony Endorphin Elite 2 - Initial Review,"Stats: 5‚Äô9, 140 pounds, running is anywhere between 6-9 minute mile paces. 50 to 70 mpw. Mid to forefoot striker. 1:28 half marathon, 3:10 marathon. Training for a sub-3 in Berlin. Mostly training in Superblast 2 and NB More V5s at the moment.

Initial Run: 13.1 miles @ 6:50-ish pace. 

Was lucky enough to get these on release. Wanted to hold off on using them until I felt better since I‚Äôve been dealing with some injuries. Decided to take them out for my long run last weekend.

These are the craziest shoes I‚Äôve ever worked on. Reminds me of the effect I felt when first trying an Alphafly in terms of how much easier it feels running. I‚Äôve tried or have owned every a shoe with every type of super foam released in the last few years are these are by far the craziest. I can‚Äôt really describe it but if I had to it would be the softness of fresh foam and the rebound of zoom x? 

They are super comfortable, about on par with the Alphafly 3 as the most comfortable super shoe I‚Äôve ever worn. Grip is surprisingly good. I can almost feel the shoe stick to the ground on push offs. Rocker is super pronounced, but you can also strike midfoot and feel the foam engage.

The only complaint I have is that it‚Äôs really squarely around corners. I felt like I had to slow down a lot or risk rolling an ankle. I wouldn‚Äôt take these on a course with lots of turns.

I have the original endorphin elite and these feel like a completely different shoe. The foam in the original are much stiffer. The only thing that‚Äôs similar is the super pronounced forefoot rocker.

Ranking super foams based on my preferences after one run:

1. These/ZoomX
2. FF Turbo+
3. Powerrun HG
4. Hoka

Gap

5. Fuel cell PB
6. Lightstrike Pro
7. Pwrrun PB/Any beaded PB
8. FF Turbo

I tend to like softer foams and these feel next generation to me in that regard.

Probably going to be deciding between these and the Alphafly 3 for Berlin.",2024-08-19 15:20:31+00:00,253,136

What does the 2E mean, and what should I be looking for? Is a 10 wide the same as a 10 2E? I don't think that going bigger will help since the 10 1/2 were snug.

1evmhft,RunningShoeGeeks,Initial thoughts: NB SC Trainer V3,"TLDR, got a mad deal on these, they‚Äôre everything I want in a trainer personally and I love them, keen to put more km‚Äôs in and out a full review up soon.  8/10 as a shoe in general (Alphaflys are 10/10 for reference yes I‚Äôm that basic with racing shoes) 

I am a medium weight runner at 78 kg. I am 178 cm tall I have a forefoot-midfoot strike and I have an easy cruising pace of around 5:30 to 6:00per kilometre. I normally wear US9.5 -10 depending on the brand, and went a 9.5 in these as I preferred the fit of it being snug but not tight.

So I‚Äôve been needing a new daily training shoe for a while after being underwhelmed by the ON Cloudeclipse (review posted previously). I have been using the Hoka Mach 6 and the Saucony ES3 for for my daily training tempo and speed sessions, kinda just swapping between them. However after doing a race in some old racing flats, I realised I need a chunkier, larger trainer to take care of my feet after racing than what I‚Äôve been using as well as to avoid injuries I‚Äôve been dealing with. This led me to the SC trainer. I compared this shoe to the Mizuno Neo Vista the Asics superblast 2 to as well as the new puma mag Max. The super blast felt a little bit too bland a little bit too stiff for what I‚Äôm wanting, though it seems to be everyone‚Äôs favourite. The Neo Vista was wonderful. That would definitely be my next option as it was springy, light and the upper was perfection. It was a very close call between this and the SC Trainer. 

I‚Äôve had the SC elite V4 on release though I returned it as it wasn‚Äôt the right racing shoe due to its softness, instability and shocking heel cup, however all of these issues are resolved in the SC Trainer, and enough weight to be a nice trainer that isn‚Äôt too heavy say like a Nimbus. 

So I‚Äôve been out for a 5.5km run with my dogs as well as 4 x 15 seconds strides at the end of it at approximately 5:30‚Äôs? Few stops to cross the road and poos to pick up and didn‚Äôt stop the watch so hard to tell. Strides crept up to 3:40‚Äôs.

Overall I found the shoe was stiff and springy enough to run fast, but soft and gently on the body at easy paces, enough to take care of my legs after multiple games of soccer last week and a long run yesterday. 

Considering I‚Äôm still recovering from a previous injury I‚Äôd say that this has handled my legs really nicely and I look forward to doing more runs in it over over the next few weeks.

In all the upper was very lightweight and comfortable, very breathable. The heel cup was plush and cushioned but not over the top say like an ASICS nimbus but lightweight and comfortable so you don‚Äôt notice it, and it actually holds you in unlike the SC Elite furthermore unlike the SC Elite the tongue is fantastic no issues there, rest of upper a nice snug fit. 
The sole is soft, spring, and bouncy. It‚Äôs fast. It‚Äôs stiff enough for fast but soft enough to take care of the legs on a slower jog and the outsole grip was very adequate, not Puma gripper, but not ON or Hoka slippery, took me nicely along damp and slightly muddy grass, roads and paved paths. (I know, first run and damp/slightly muddy grass? We‚Äôll welcome to having very active and strong dogs, sometimes you don‚Äôt get a choice üòÇ

Only real downside I‚Äôve found is the price. This shoe is expensive at $330 Australian however I got it cheap, $203.99 ( 20% sale, store credit, click and collect credit and Cashrewards cashback, and a bonus, I earned another $11.15 for this purchase, insane value from Rebel)
At that price it‚Äôs an absolute bargain and I feel like I‚Äôve robbed rebel sport as well as snagged one of the greatest value super trainers I‚Äôd be able to get.

Thanks for listening. I‚Äôll have a full review out in a couple weeks time once I‚Äôve reached over 100 km in it and have enough variety of runs and time in it to have full thoughts on it.

1evkz5m,trailrunning,‚ÄúEveryday‚Äù trail shoe,"After a solid chunk of distance on my Speedgoat 5, I‚Äôm looking for my next pair (or 2) of shoes. Ideally a Swiss Army knife shoe that can handle different terrain. 

The new Hoka Tecton x3 has really peaked my interest but I‚Äôm reading it‚Äôs a ‚Äúrace‚Äù shoe. Has anyone used a race shoe as their everyday shoe? Maybe I‚Äôd only use it on longer runs (meaning 30km+ to me). Would it just wear faster as a race shoe? I‚Äôm fairly light at 135-140 pounds.

I‚Äôve read the Adidas Terrex Agravic Speed is a solid everyday shoe. But also heard it runs big (¬Ω to a full size) and no local shops have them in stock. I guess I could order 2 sizes and return one if I go that route.

-i want a sneaker with nuetral colors because i would love to be able to wear them casually as well as when exercising and i cant stand neon nasty

I bought these as a daily alternate for my NB4. As mentioned in a separate post, I really enjoy the NB4 but I‚Äôve found at distances over say 12km I get a slight pins and needles sensation in the bottom of my forefoot. Not enough to affect the run, just strange for me. 

Today I took the Skyflow out for an inaugural 16km cruise which had some large ascents and descents throughout. I held 5:15 pretty consistently for the run. These shoes just ate it up. Plush enough to maintain comfort throughout the run, but didn‚Äôt run hot at all. Very very stable for such a high stack. Typical Hoka geometry kept the legs turning over at a consistent cadence so nothing groundbreaking there. The responsiveness is decent, again nothing groundbreaking but for sure snappier and more responsive than Clifton‚Äôs. The outsole grip is quite tacky. Felt like I had gum stuck to my shoes (in a good way if that makes sense)

The fit is‚Ä¶ strange. Narrow but long. I went a 1/2 size up based on another redditors advice and I‚Äôm glad because these are quite narrow. See second picture. I have A LOT of room up in the toes. Some may not like that. Works for me though.

1euvnrn,walking,Do my abnormal feet cause issues with foot scans?,"I went to fleet feet recently and got a foot scan and I just want to make sure I fully understand the results to ensure I get the right shoe. That being said I've never really had issues with any shoes I've owned so I'm wondering if expensive ones are even worth it.

Anyway the reason I say my feet are abnormal is that I am a very short male, 5'0"" on a good day and wear a size 6.5 shoes but I tend to buy 7s because that's generally the cutoff between child and adult shoes and I'm not trying to get shoes with lights or wheels in them.

So the scan shows my heel to tow length and pretty low compared to the male population, which makes sense. Everything else, ball width, arch height, instep height, heel width, ball girth and instep girth are all high, in many cases as high as it goes compared to the male population.

I'm just wondering if my short length feet affect that at all or if it doesn't matter and I really do have stupidly wide feet and high instep and medium/high arch height?

Ive never bought wide shoes before, always regular. Fleet feet did give me a few different support shoes to try and I settled on the hoka gaviota wide mostly because the cushion felt nice. But I've read some about support shoes and many seem to say they are a gimmick and/or are not the best way to correct feet issues. I also bought a pair of Brooks glycerin 21 not wide online. They feel pretty much the same cushion wise compared to the gaviota.i suppose I can probably feel them being a little narrower but it doesn't feel bad. I do also wonder if going a half size up like I do might eliminate the need to get a wide shoe but I'm not really sure.

I just want to find the right shoe for the walking to lose weight I've been doing and also for a trip to Disney in October. Not sure if I should get a wide support shoe, a neutral shoe, a neutral shoe with an insoles or just keep using what I've been using. I also feel bad buying these shoes and returning them if they dont work but I suppose that is the point of the generous return policies at places like fleet foot.

Lastly I am debating about going to another show store. I have 2 other good options, roadrunner which can do the scans similar to fleet feet, they also apparently push their insoles pretty hard I hear. And the. A local running company that will do sizing and gait analysis with a human rathern than some sensors.

1ethxb5,trailrunning,Trail Running Shoe Recommendation (Salomon vs Hoka),"Hi everyone I just started trail running and running in general and I‚Äôm looking to purchase an all terrain trail running shoe. I‚Äôm looking for shoes good for casual hikes, muddy and technical trail. I am usually running upwards of 10km on my regular running shoes, I can feel every rock üòÇ but the water drains really fast. (More info: my feet is relatively flat and wide).

I‚Äôm currently looking at:
‚Ä¢Speedcross 6 (wide) - tried it on and the heel to toe drop was very aggressive. But I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs got great traction and is more for technical terrain.

‚Ä¢Hoka Speedgoat 5 - haven‚Äôt tried it on but heard mixed reviews about its performance on wet trail. What do people think of this ?

‚Ä¢Hoka Challenger atr 7 - I was initially looking at these shoes as they were hybrid. Good for road and trail. But that means I would need another shoe for a more technical trail. 

‚Ä¢Brooks Cascadia - first time hearing about these brands, heard they were good all round. 

What‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs opinion on this? I‚Äôm posting now cause speedcross 6 and Hoka speedgoat 5 are on saleüòÇ",2024-08-16 06:39:01+00:00,3,17
1etc9or,RunningShoeGeeks,Puma Elite v3 (After 3 runs),"Hi,

I‚Äôm in my 50‚Äôs, around 75kg and did my first two half marathon races last year in the Saucony pro 3‚Äôs (1.49, 1.47). I hope to do another race soon. I tend to pronate a bit, heel to midfoot strike and am a slower runner ranging from 4.40 to 5.45 per km paces. I use a heel insert which gives me extra stability.

I use various shoes for the training - Saucony triumph 20, Saucony speed 3s, and NB SC elite v3, Hoka Mach 6, Asics Novablast 1/3.

Looking for another race day shoe as I have 230km on my Saucony Pro 3s (Size 11) (I do have a newer pair of Saucony‚Äôs too ‚Äì 40% off as back up). I was considering the Asics Edge Paris, Nike Alphafly 3 and Puma NE 3.

Recently went and tried these 3 shoes in the shop on a treadmill and a running track in the store. ¬†

**~Shoe Comparisons~**

**Asics Edge Paris vs Puma**

The Asics (size 11) was a nice fit, however when running I could feel quite a lot of pronation, and the heel felt very narrow. Heel was quite firm, felt a nice push forward. The Puma however felt more stable for me, softer at the heel, felt a similar but gentler push forward. Puma - sized down to 10.5 felt a better lockdown, felt a little more cushioned and softer all round too.

**Nike Alphafly 3 vs Puma**

Nike Alphafly felt bouncy, and loud, felt like it was a little too soft on the heel. Pretty good on straight lines but around corners felt I was collapsing, upper not secure enough. Felt very bouncy but not very smooth. Puma felt more secure for me, grips well around corners. Very smooth heel to toe transition.

So purchased the Puma.

**~Three Runs in Puma Elite 3 vs Saucony Pro 3‚Äôs~**

**~Summary~**

**Initial Run: 8k tempo Run**

Took the Puma for an 8km tempo run. Very smooth, punchy and responsive off the toes, reasonably stable, great lockdown and light. The rocker is very smooth. I ran an average of 4.51 km pace, normally run in the Saucony pro 3‚Äôs the same course between 4.54 -5min km pace, so felt was a little faster on the Puma for similar effort. A couple kms I did around 4.40 pace - very impressed.

**Second Run ‚Äì slower 5km run**

At 5.24 average pace average one km was at 5.37. It wasn‚Äôt clunky still quite smooth but you could tell it wanted to go faster. Heart rate was low so quite efficient. Up hills was fine, down a hill I didn‚Äôt find too much instability landing on the heel. Similar versatility to the Saucony pro 3‚Äôs, seems slightly easier to run slow in Puma. ¬†

**Third Run ‚Äì ¬Ω marathon (21km)**

My first ¬Ω marathon distance in 10 months, so a bit unfit for that distance. Quite humid. In the saucony last week I did 18km run at 5.26 pace. Did 21 km in the Puma today at 5.18 pace. It seemed a little faster and easier at slower paces. Summary: Great lockdown, reasonably stable, bouncy, comfortable and smooth all the way ‚Äì didn‚Äôt lose any pop, toes start to feel it a bit at 17km mark and the midsole did soften a little on the toes area. Puma probably still breaking in.

**Vs the Saucony Pro 3‚Äôs for ¬Ω marathon.**

Saucony - I feel has a touch more protection (Wider shoe) but you do feel the plate more.¬† A little firmer towards the end the run, love the speedroll technology of the Saucony . The Saucony upper is slightly more breathable. The Puma does feel lighter you don‚Äôt feel the plate as much, and seems easier to pick up the pace. Puma definitely better and faster (more propulsive at 5-10km distance) and longer. I do love the Saucony Pro 3‚Äôs too for ¬Ω marathon.

¬†

**~Summary after 3 Runs (vs Saucony Pro 3)~**

**Upper:**

Breathable (not as much as Saucony pro 3), race fit but plenty of adjustment with laces, the tongue is better than Saucony as a bit of extra padding at the top of the tongue and doesn‚Äôt slip down like the Saucony.

**Sizing/Fit/weight**

The Puma runs a little long and narrow, usually wear size 11, and went for 10.5. If wider feet - maybe true to size. ¬†The Saucony pro 3 (size 11) is wider but has a tighter upper, similar length to the Puma‚Äôs size 10.5. Weight Puma 220g vs Saucony 230g. The heel width is 85mm (P) vs 89mm (S). Midfoot considerably narrower on Puma, forefoot slightly narrower. Puma feels lighter, Saucony feels like it‚Äôs a bigger and wider shoe which gives you confidence.

**Stability/Feel**

Stability a bit better on the Saucony especially at the heel but still pretty good in the Puma. The rocker is slightly more aggressive in the Puma with a more explosive toe off. The plate in the Puma I read is similar to the Asics Edge Paris/Nike vaporfly/Saucony pro 3 ‚Äì dips down into the forefoot. Puma‚Äôs heel is fairly soft.

**Midsole:**

A nice balance between soft and firm, the heel is softer than forefoot. Your feet feel flat while walking and more unstable at the heel but when running stability improved. You can feel the rocker and plate assist you moving forward and a roll. Words that come to mind - Very smooth and responsive on toe off

**Outsole**

Puma grip is fantastic better than Saucony. Great for cornering and imagine it be good in the wet.

**Ride**

Cushioned and Protective similar to saucony pro 3, maybe less harsh. Very smooth transitions - versatile and forgiving. Bouncy and responsive off toe off. Rocker not to aggressive, early and seems quite natural.¬† The ride I feel is fairly similar to the Saucony pro 3, but faster and seem to be more responsive foam, a quick slight sink and bounce with a more powerful toe off. It seems okay at slower paces too, not clunky.

**~Overall~**

**~Strengths:~** Great lockdown, Enjoyable ride, efficient ‚Äì propulsive snappy at toe off, versatile for various paces and distances, works for various runners. Reasonably stable. Light, Cushioned ‚Äì not to firm or soft. Cheaper than a lot of carbon plated shoes.

**Weaknesses:** Runs probably ¬Ω size long, runs narrow (suit my feet), little yellow dye on my white socks after ¬Ω marathon run. ¬†

**~So overall~** - one of the most enjoyable plated shoes, which light, protective and cushioned and reasonably stable. Efficient, bouncy with snappy toe off, quick transitions, easy to pick-up the pace and hold the pace. (Probably repeated myself). It‚Äôs a versatile shoe (Trainer/racer) for short and long runs, for training at faster paces. Tempo runs, intervals, and for races. I would use it for 5 km to ¬Ω marathon races and for slower runners like me.

It‚Äôs a good replacement or addition to the Saucony pro 3‚Äôs and I feel it‚Äôs a little bit more responsive too. I would give them at least 9/10.¬† Please ask any questions you like.¬† ¬†",2024-08-16 01:21:50+00:00,44,17

1er1v9p,RunningShoeGeeks,On Cloud Surfer - 700km,"M 6ft2 87kg HM: 1:27 Mar 2:58 mid foot striker

Have recently retired my cloud surfer (just over the 700km mark) so though would share my thought on the shoe. 

I used this shoe almost exclusively as a daily trainer for runs around the 45 - 60 minute range but some specific runs I did in it include (all in minutes per km): 

Long run - 25km at 5:00. Tempo - 13km at 
4:30. Easy - 8km at 5:15 (most common). Recovery - 5km at 6:00. 

Other shoes I have include - Hoka Mach 6, Cielo X1, NB 1080 v 12 and NB pacer v1. 
In terms of fit, this for me tts with no issues, no hot spots or rubbing or any issues to note. Runs slightly short I felt but again overall no issues. 

Who is this shoe for? I think if you just looking for a no frills daily trainer, that is comfortable on the foot and you wanting a more lower profile (less max stack height shoe) then certainly a decent option to look at. If you looking for a non carbon race shoe probably wouldn‚Äôt be my first option. Additionally if you wanting a big booming bounce (such as a superblast, that‚Äôs not this). I probably wouldn‚Äôt put this in the ‚Äúdo it all‚Äù category, but would say it would be a good first trainer for someone getting into running and not really looking at various sessions etc. or even someone looking for a walking shoe/travelling shoe. It also look great to me (personal taste).

What I used this shoe for I really enjoyed it. It is extremely comfortable on the foot and provides a very easy ride. (For reference on  the comfort if someone was looking for a shoe and they spend all day on their feet I would suggest this shoe). There is a fairly nice rocker which helps roll through the stride nicely. Had a decent amount of responsiveness to it to a point (will touch on that later). Was always very happy throwing them on and going for a run which is all I really want from a daily trainer.

However, I would say I didn‚Äôt really enjoy this shoe at anything other than daily pace. For tempo and intervals it worked fine but wouldn‚Äôt be my first option. Long runs I found it started to bottom out around the hour make (c.13km) and just didn‚Äôt give me the protection I wanted. Recovery, similar to above. Was fine but would like something a bit more padded. 

In terms of durability I would say it‚Äôs actually done pretty well in terms of the ‚Äúvisual‚Äù durability. There is some wear in the heal (normal for me) and the outsole has pretty much lost all of its grip but still looks good. I will say though that the bounce/responsiveness of the shoe is very dead though (why it‚Äôs been retired unfortunately). It did start to look that bounce around the 450/500km mark for what it‚Äôs worth (would give it a B- grade in my books). 

Just some thoughts on what people have said about the shoe/what I have seen people use the shoe for: 
- a good tempo shoe: ah 50/50 on this one. Can certainly be used for that but not really sure hat I would use it for. 
- unstable: it is certainly a soft shoe. But I always felt pretty planted to the group so never had any issues with that (I do come from a trail
Background though so might be impacting that a little l). 
- a warm shoe: yeah I would agree. I have run in the heat with this shoe and it‚Äôs been fine but not the most breathable shoe around. 

Slightly rough but have seen some reviews who used it for road ultra (believe that was on the Run Testers). I mean if you didn‚Äôt have any other option then yeah I suppose you could use it but it would be very low on my list of options for that. 

In summary, I have enjoyed it and probably would get it again if was looking for an exclusive daily trainer. 

If anyone is looking at picking it up I do believe there is v2 coming out soon so maybe worth hanging on and seeing that before picking it up. 

Happy to answer any questions!

1er1g3y,PlantarFasciitis,IT Band connection ? ,"Hey foot fam. 

I've had this a decade now. 
It first showed up 9 years ago. I was crushing it. Hiked Mt. Whitney twice in one month. Hiking 3000+ elevation at least every weekend. Then of all things seemingly a drive up the coast in flip flops and I had the sudden  arch pain. Ok fine. I had shit medical. Went downtown. The guy did a shot in my foot right in the exact pain spot. I almost kicked him in the face. He put me in a boot for a few weeks. Pain disappeared. Random note. He had me get an MRI and I was yes, burned in the MRI. On my lower leg. 

I was pain free for nine years. Hiked a lot. Happy. Then I blew my knee out on a backpacking trip in the sierras a few years later. Wasn't trained for backpack weight. I'll never forgive myself. MRI (not burned this time thanks guys) shows IT band syndrome*

(I have severe PMDD. And hiking is my only form of mental health. So this is dibilitating for me losing this outlet.)

Had a large baby almost ten pounds. Recovered. Lost all the weight. Started hiking slowly on weekends.  Slowly over like a year. Started getting up to 20 mile hikes and as soon as I hit 3000 elevation total I felt the pinch in the side of my knee and the IT band flare up was back. Not soon later.. the fucking PF came back. The knee I could deal with. It's depressing as hell to be on low local hikes but at least I can do that. And be outdoors and moving local. I know my routines to back off. Deflate the knee. Work up again. Etc. The PF back again is another thing. 

Better medical now I went to good podiatrist who says you have one leg shorter than the other do non stop Pilates. Never be barefoot. Get slides. Go to chiro. No need for MRI. No need for shots. Try these shoes see ya.

I'm a single married mom. (It's a thing) I have zero time to do Pilates. I tried. I googled. I stretch. I switched to hoka clifton 9. Got some relief. Then it got worse. I went back said I don't have time for this shit. She stabbed with shot. A bit fast for my liking. I got a cortisone flare. After a week. Seemed to do nothing. Is it worse? Who knows. But now my IT band HURTS and that had been silent for a while. I know everything is connected, duh. But if there are are hikers that have experience with this and please God have solved it please share the secret sauce! I would give anything to do summits again and take my kiddo up there when she's older üò¢ I'm not really a runner except downhill if that matters. 

I just started reading this Dr. Angela foot lady and it's all the opposite advise and it's all head spinning. üòµ‚Äçüí´ I get the concept of zero drop/ heel drop etc. im starting to think I might try this route since none of this stuff is working. & 

*after losing the baby weight around same time I started hiking again I did start wearing brooks Adrenaline. Which many of us attribute to causing/reintroducing PF yayyy

*I now have a 40 pound toddler and I definitely carry her up stairs everyday. I'm sure this helps things. 

* my body has stopped making hormones. - see PMDD. So losing weight is virtually impossible. I'm about 20 pounds over. But ironically when I first got PF I was in top shape and health. 

I didn't intend on typing out my life story. But I'm desperate. ü§£ thank you for annnny ideas. Grateful for all of the nuggets yall put out here daily. ",2024-08-13 07:08:18+00:00,6,26
1er1fno,RunningShoeGeeks,Saucony Speed 3 - 500mi / 800km Parting Thoughts,"
I posted my 150mi/240km update here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/s/uOhj7oEcgI

After having a second kid, it took FOREVER to hit the 500mi.  I finally made it and here‚Äôs a few parting thoughts.

Tread: Lowlight.  Re-glued the tread back in multiple times to try and lengthen the use of the shoe.  While the shoe glue is a perfectly good fix, it was rather annoying.  Ultimately around 350-400mi I gave up and just let it be.

Feel:  The actual shoe held up well over the miles.  The full energy return of the nylon plate degraded over time but didn‚Äôt necessarily feel like it compromised the shoe overall.  I was using it as an everyday trainer so I wasn‚Äôt necessarily pushing the shoe to perform anything spectacular.  This is different than my experience with Hokas.  Rincons and Machs seemed to have a much more noticeable change in feel when it was past due for a new pair.

Cloth/Material: Unlike the tread, the fabric and laces proved highly durable.  I didn‚Äôt experience an inordinate amount of stretch or give that made the shoe unusable.  

Overall - happy with what I got from the shoe.  I‚Äôm systematically trying new brands and shoes so next up are some Brooks Glycerin 21s.",2024-08-13 07:07:29+00:00,93,62

1epitj3,Marathon_Training,"Paris ""Marathon pour tous"" feedback from the guy who posted about meeting Molly Seidel this week","Long but explicative title.

Since some of you asked me on my previous post, here's my feedback from the race which was my first marathon.

For the context, I'm a Parisian (suburbian to be precise) here and last minute member of Team Orange Running, the company which organized the race.

First of all, I'd like to thank the organization, it was fantastically (do we say this ?) prepared. I'd like to thank even more the crowd, so friendly, so warm and joyful. Can't count the number of hands that I've clapped. And I'd like to thank the scenery : Paris is gorgeous and I still want to cry when I look back at the monuments we've seen.

As for the race itself, hard. Very hard. I ran the marathon in 3:51:00. I aimed at a faster time initially but we (a group of friends and I) have had a lot of difficulties (not related to the organisation) during the day and I had to ride my bike like for 25km.

I stopped to almost every refreshment zone, since it was hot and I was afraid to get deshydrated. There was this famous hill (la c√¥te des Gardes) which was really a wall. I didn't want to believe it in the first place but gosh, it was hard.

I also made a huge mistake with my shoes : I bought few weeks ago the Hoka Mach 6 : same size as my previous Hoka Mach 4 and 5 but this model runs very short and my feet have taken a huge toll. So, if you want the Mach 6, just be aware that the sizing is off. Of course, I already knew this before taking those for this race as I ran quite a bit with them already but until the big race, I managed to deal with them for long runs and I assumed it would be ok for 42k but big mistake. It was stupid.

As for the preparation, I can't thank this sub enough : a lot of good insights there. I started around april (but already raced a difficult trail in february) with a coach the organization granted me. Lot of intervals training mixed with endurance (and blocks of marathon speed). We raced a half a month ago that I did in 1:35. I was in good shape and at my peak. Unfortunately, Covid, a hyperextended knee and fasciitis slowed me all together starting three weeks ago.

1eo78rr,PlantarFasciitis,Lost weight and my PF went away???,"I lost 20 pounds and my plantar fasciitis went away. I went from not being able to walk for more than 20 min without pain to now walking for 2+ hours with no pain at all. 

I‚Äôm shocked. 

My doctor never mentioned weight gain as the potential issue/cause. (Pre pandemic I was within BMI then gained a 40 pounds. I developed PF a few years ago). 

I‚Äôm still going to do some of the foot exercises at home and hope it goes away entirely (I still feel minor foot pain occasionally) but wow wow. I feel like this is my aha moment. This was the culprit all along???

Edit: a lot of commenters asking how I lost the weight. I was overeating. Like eating twice as much as I normally would pre pandemic. Food became my comfort through depression. I would eat just to eat. I was also eating out a lot. I stopped doing that. Started cooking at home with regular sized portions (and healthy meals). I also started biking (which didn‚Äôt hurt my feet with PF) then after the pain subsided I started walking everyday (30-45 min). I used to feel like cooking meals was a chore, now it‚Äôs a hobby and it‚Äôs fun (I follow social media accounts to get healthy recipe ideas). I walk at least an hour everyday now that the pain is gone (with hoka sneakers is optimal). TLDR: exercise, calorie reduction and changed type of food. ",2024-08-09 18:30:51+00:00,109,49
1enuz4u,trailrunning,Please help me to a shoe for my first longer trail race (and training),"Hi all, 

I am going to run my first longer trail race in end October. Its 25 km, and I am very used to the distance on road, with multiple marathons, but this is new terrain for me. 

  
I got a few shoes already, but I dont really see either of them fit for purpose, so help me on the way. 

  
The race will take place on smaller trails in a pine and beech wood forrest with soft bed, and little to no rocks. We can expect it to be wet though. 

I currently have:

* Asics Fujispeed 2. Fantasticly light and responsive with amazing grip, but the carbon plate hurts like hell after 10k. They fit well in my UK7/US8
* Then I got the Zegama. I bought them in an outlet for next to nothing. Grip is terrible, and i dont have a good lockdown - seems like foot is sitting too high in the shoe. Fit will in UK 7
* Norda 001 - Lovely shoe. Great lockdown and feel, but they are slow and poor grip in soft and wet mud. Lovely for cruising in zone 2. Fit well in UK 7.5/US8.5

  
So far my favorite is the Nordas for the race, but I would love a more versitile shoe in gerneal both for training and longer slow trail runs. 

Im considering these - tend to look at cushioned shoes for longer training runs (25km+)

* Merrel Agility Peak 5 - Seems like the new do-it-all shoe. Cheap and available where I live. Any feedback on the sizing?
* Xoudus Ultra 2 (3 seems pricy atm)
* Other saucony shoes (edge, rift) as saucony on the road side really fits well
* Hoka Mafate Speed 4 - hear they are great and breathable. 

Any feedback on what would a great choice for the conditions and properties I look for?

1emv53g,FootFunction,Two Month old MRI Findings for my left ankle and figuring out (trying to) how to figure out where or what it means to go from here...    ,"In the the middle of March this last year I started taking pretty long walks on a bike path that leads to a forest preserve near me.  The whole thing took 2-3 hours and my phone said I walked about 8 miles or 20K steps.   It was great.  Something I'd been gearing up to do for years.  I use to be a runner.  I ran track in high school and I was not the best but I made a lot of improvements I guess and in my 20s I stuck with running and enjoyed a lot of yoga and got into cycling and barefoot shoes.  I haven't run in a while.  I have been waiting to get healthy enough feet via barefoot minimalist shoes and then run and build a lasting practice of running et cetera.  Well life has surely happened and I continue to little engine that could my life.  After almost three months of waking up as the sun rises and heading out for my walk, I had to stop and the results are what I pasted below.  I have not walked except for some short 30 minute walks on pavement.  And I have spent countless hours trying to figure out what new shoes I need when my stress fracture has been given the time to heal.  My doctor recommended Hokas but I was hoping to not throw in the towel on whatever my aim was with the whole barefoot thing.  I can appreciate starting slowly and taking appropriate next step after appropriate next step but I hate to say that I cant articulate what any of that is.  Please help!!!  :(.        



I just ordered a pair of Vivo ESC  Forest Trackers and a Naboso Toe spacer but even with that I feel paralyzed upon further going down the rabbit hole of all things barefoot and heel-toe drops.  I don't think I injured myself too badly but I have learned how common most of my issues are as a result of having transitioned to barefoot shoes the way I have.   I was a heal striker.  I did start jumping from the front of my foot and when I only started walking in my barefoot shoes and not even taking my time with those.  I assumed I wasn't running, only walking and I was healthy so I think the ailments I have all make sense in terms of this is where I can say I have been and what ive done.  I dont know where to begin except maybe see if anyone can help with a few honestly informed suggestions to help me start to guide myself.  I feel like I need proper insoles and maybe I should consider Altra.  Maybe some lower drop shoes.    But maybe I can stick with the zero drop shoes?  I can feel how weak my ankles feel just sitting.  I'm not in any pain really.  Some days I have a little hip soreness.  My right knee has been feeling a little funny the last 24 hrs.  But I never really have knee or hip pain.  I have all manner of exercise equipment but im just growing a little overwhelmed with meaning too well.  imo.   

  
How slow should I start out?  Should I begin with different toe spacers?  I have images from my MRI and I do feel like Id never thought I have high arches or did but I think the way I have walked in my shoes these last few months that Im using my heel and the front of my feet and im sort of supinating.  I feel like my midfoot is probably pretty rigid.  I recently bought an insert from Sole insoles, the performance medium with met pad.  I'm not sure if I need a the thick performance with met pad but get a size larger than what I have bought and trim it to fit my barefoot shoes better?  I found something called bridge soles and those sound compelling.  I also feel like I could invest in some of the Naboso insoles to really customize the fit of my shoes when reintroducing myself to walking longer and longer distances?  Should I tape my ankle?  Should I get a heel cup?  How can I bring balance to the muscles of my feet that is appropriate for where I am at given the results of my scan and also the goal of being able to be healthy in a healthy way?  Anyone?

INDICATION:¬† Acute left ankle pain.¬† Evaluate for stress fracture of calcaneus.

COMPARISON: June 17, 2024 radiographs

FINDINGS:

There is abnormal curvilinear hypointense signal at the posterior calcaneus bone marrow on sagittal STIR series 9 image 24, measuring 1.7 cm in length.¬† There is surrounding marrow edema with increased INR, decreased T1-weighted signal on this image and on series 8 image 23.¬† There is mild increased inversion recovery signal at the talus, anterolaterally, with corresponding increased T2 FS signal.¬† Reference series 9 image 24 and series 7 image 19.¬† There is a small slightly ill-defined approximately 16 mm area of increased STIR, faintly decreased T1-weighted signal at the distal anterior tibial bone marrow.¬† Reference image 24 series 9 and image 23 series 8.¬† This may represent trace stress reaction or marrow activation.¬† Tiny focus of mild increased IR signal at the proximal plantar aspect of cuboid bone on sagittal series 9 image 24, adjacent to the calcaneocuboid joint, could be degenerative or due to stress reaction.

Diffuse increased T2 FS signal throughout the subcutaneous soft tissues.

Slightly curved morphology of the anterior talofibular ligament on series 5 image 19 axial.¬† Intact posterior talofibular ligament.¬† Unremarkable MRI appearance of calcaneofibular ligament.¬† Intact syndesmotic ligaments.¬† Intact deltoid and spring ligaments.

1emgfvg,FootFunction,Shoe recommendation for peroneal tendonitis?,"I (30M) sprained my ankle in college and didn't do physical therapy. The past year I've developed seemingly spontaneous issues with that ankle. I saw the podiatrist last week who said it likely is peroneal tendonitis due to laxity of the sprained ligament. She recommended neutral shoes with good arch support, and some ankle support if possible. She mentioned a few brands that she generally recommends (Brooks, Hoka, New Balance, etc) but no specific shoe recommendations.

Any recommendations for this particular condition for a daily sneaker for walking and maybe light exercise? A huge plus for me would be the ability to slip on the shoe because I am lazy and cannot be bothered to bend down to put them on. She did say she is able to slip on her Hoka shoes but I don't know which ones they are.",2024-08-07 16:32:29+00:00,1,0
1eme3gj,PlantarFasciitis,Help me find comfy dress shoes!,"I have plenty of traditional comfy shoes for every day.  I love my Oofos and Hokas.  I even have a pair of the soft bed Birkenstocks that I love.  My problem is that I work a job where I need a good pair of dress shoes with that same level of comfort all over the entire shoe.  I have tried a Vionic flat that is very comfy on the bottom but no amount of breaking in has made the back stop giving my heals blisters. I have attempted inserts in my heels but they always end up sliding at least a little and I end up with foot pain in various places depending on the inserts and the heels.

After being diagnosed with plantar fasciitis a few years ago and the process of finding what works for me and keeps my feet from hurting, I am over ""You just have to break it in for a while!""  If I have to deal with the pain to get to good, it is not worth it for me any more.  Hokas can be business dress, right? LOL!

\*Edit - I forgot to mention that I am looking for a more feminine shoe that I could wear with skirts and dresses.

1em5jaw,RunningShoeGeeks,Novablast 4 after 75km - First Time Asics Wearer,"I have never been drawn to ASICS since I started running properly in 2019 since they always seemed to be lacking in the aesthetic department compared to other brands but recently, they've really upped their game.

Background: 30yo male, 176cm, 65kg, midfoot striker, usually race over ultra distances, no official HM or marathon times but I have a 5k pb of 17:31 and 10k of 35:56.

Current rotation: Endorphin Speed 2, 3 & 4, Endorphin Pro 3, Kinvara Pro, Salomon Phantasm 2, Puma DNE2. 

I came across the Novablasts in my search for a non-plated, softish (on the firmer side of soft) shoe to use to eat up my daily miles without making me want to push the pace like the Endorphin Speeds do (2 & 4 at least). The other shoes I looked at and tried on were the Triumph 22, the Hoka Skyflow and the Rebel V4. The Triumph and the Skyflow felt nice underfoot but just felt a little bit heavy compared to the Novablast and the Rebel of course felt very light but didn't feel as cushioned as I was looking for.

I've put 75k on these shoes over the past 6 days with the shortest run at 10k and the longest at 24k. Most of the runs have been at a cruisy 5:00-5:10 pace. One run was a full 12k at about 4:35 and then I've done a few ks during runs down towards 4:10ish.

The look: I absolutely love the look of the shoe and this new colourway for the Paris Olympics is great. I'm a big fan of colours on shoes (I often prefer women's colourways over men's as they're way more flamboyant) and these don't disappoint. I love a chunky looking midsole and the Novablast's deliver.

The upper: the upper is forgettable in the best possible way. It fits well, the lock down is great and it fits very much true to size for me. A good upper for me is one that I don't have any comments on other than it feels good. I've had no issues with rubbing or blisters and that's a win in my book. The one concern that I have with the upper is that it's fairly thick which may be an issue come summer here in Australia.

The midsole: the midsole shocked me to be honest. I read and watched plenty of reviews on these shoes before I bought them and they all said that they had lost the 'pop' that the Novablast 3 had. I've found that this shoe has no issues at all at any pace from about 4:20 and slower. It is actually quite a fun shoe. The rocker is great and really helps in transition. The midsole is in no way as responsive as an Endorphin 4 but it still gives you enough to make the run fun and not sluggish. It's probably firmer than some people would like a 'soft' shoe to feel but it suits me perfectly.

The outsole: the grip in the dry is faultless as it should be. It hasn't rained in the past week so I can't comment on their performance in the wet but I sure hope they're better than Saucony's outsoles are in the wet. Durability is also hard to judge so far although there are no signs of any wear yet. I am a light footed runner so I like to be able to get anywhere from 800-1000km from a daily shoe so time will tell with these.

Conclusion: a soft but not squishy midsole with a very helpful rocker and a good, yet forgettable upper wrapped in a really nice colourway make the Novablast 4 a great addition to my rotation for easy daily miles and the odd little hit out up to about threshold pace if the urge strikes.",2024-08-07 07:20:09+00:00,137,69

1elfdm6,trailrunning,Looking for a trail running shoe,"I've spent some time now looking for a trail running shoe and i'm getting lost in useless information without getting to any place at all. Websites point out to all different kinds of things like ""vegan"", ""0 emissions"" and 3000 different kinds of tech that i dont wanna know about, while at the same time they make it difficult to get an easy view of the basic specs like drop, weight, front and rear height, cushioning, narrow/wide fit, or lug size. At this point i'd just buy whatever because i'm tired of searching and i thought i could get some help from you.

I've always used the speedcross from salomon (model 3 and 4), and they've felt very fine so far, i like that they're snug and they allow for good precision, i also like the feeling of being close to the ground with them and the lacing system, but i've never enjoyed that much the agressiveness of their sole for technical rocky terrain, and neither the amount of drop they have (10mm. Although i gotta admit they feel uncomonly stable for such a high heel). Now i'm also using some old Scarpa Newtrons (6mm drop, which feel clumsy because they are too wide, dont have good cushioning and in the end dont fit my running style or something) and Asics Trabuco 11 (which are great and have the best cushioning ever, but they dont feel better than the speedcross in short and technical trails because the midsole feels unstable due to being too thick, the toe box is too wide and the sole lugs are way too much. They're awesome as my long distance comfy shoes though).

So i'm looking for a shoe that can run on technical terrain (big rocks, high gradient uphills/downhills and compact sand), made for short distances (5-15k) but that at the same time has some bit of cushioning. Probably i'd like for it to have a narrow fit (becasue i value precision) and mostly that it makes me feel connected to the ground (i'm really not into these fat Hoka style of midsoles). As for the drop, i dont think i'd enjoy anything outside of 5 to 8mm. I feel like the perfect shoe would be a 6mm drop speedcross with the midsole a bit more narrower and something like a zegama sole.

As of now, I've got my eye set on the Brooks Catamount 3, Hoka Torrent 3, Asics Fuji Lite 5 and the Speedcross 6 aswell. Also, although they dont seem to fit my description but because of the reviews and good comments i've read in here, i even see myself with a pair of Hoka Speedgoat 5s. Which one would you recommend? Is there any other shoe you'd suggest?

Thanks in advance

Edit: I know the best thing would be to go to a shop, i've always done that in the past, but now i have non near where i live. The best shops here have no more than 3 options to buy from.",2024-08-06 11:32:40+00:00,0,19
1el79ty,RunningShoeGeeks,On Cloudboom Strike ,"Male / Size 13 

6ft / 182cm 

170lb / 77kg

Shoe weight: 7.6oz

Mid foot striker / Road runner

First run: 6 miles / 9.67km ~ Pace: 7:48mi / 4:51km

I purchased these shoes from Fleet Feet these are my first OnCloud shoes. They didn‚Äôt have a size 13 so I went with a 12.5, and they fit perfectly. I initially didn‚Äôt run in these shoes, I left home to head for the greenway but had a lot to do that day. So I went to the grocery store, and to the post office, and then the gym because it was too hot to run at that point. That‚Äôs when I discovered these are lifestyle shoes for me. Very stable and incredibly comfortable. I continued to use them off and on for 2 weeks as a lifestyle shoe, I even hit the YMCA for a strength and conditioning class. They hold up very well, and never feel uncomfortable‚Ä¶and everyone loves the way they look. No shoe I‚Äôve ever worn gets this many eyes, and compliments. 

On to the run‚Ä¶

Upper: This shoe is very breathable and light weight. The upper material is comfortable with no lace bite, the laces themselves are incredibly long for no reason at all. I apply the Supwell double bow tie, and it‚Äôs a non issue. It‚Äôs a little effort to actually get them on, you‚Äôll need to grab the thin heel counter and the tongue at the same time to slip your foot in. I had no issue with the thin heel, as there are pads on each side of the heel in the lower sections. 

Midsole: It‚Äôs lovely, I‚Äôve never run in a more natural feeling shoe. It manages to give ground feel, but have this incredible cushioning. It‚Äôs not 1080 v13 soft, but it‚Äôs also not in the firm category. I‚Äôm very impressed how they managed to make the perfect midsole for my foot. The rocker isn‚Äôt incredibly prominent, like on the Noosa Tri or Hoka Cielo X1. It‚Äôs gradual, and the word I‚Äôll keep using ‚Äúnatural‚Äù feeling. It‚Äôs like if they got the Streakfly right. The Nike Streakfly had a good foam feeling, but not enough in the forefoot‚Ä¶it also had ground feel and felt fast and light. The Cloudboom Strike does all of those things, and I have to credit the midsole insert technology. I‚Äôm not sure who did it first, or if anyone put that much R&D into a shoe insert that doubles as a whole other foam. Think ultra performance Dr. Scholls.

Outsole: It‚Äôs only been one run, it‚Äôs too early to tell but I didn‚Äôt have any deterioration or obvious blemishes to the rubber. I‚Äôm big on how the shoe sounds at all paces when I‚Äôm running. Everyone hates a squeaky shoe. But I love a quiet, or unique sounding shoe when running, and this one fits in that quiet but enjoyable white noise category. It‚Äôs a pleasant sounding shoe. 

Conclusion: 

This is my new favorite shoe of 2024, the Hoka Cielo X1 is now in second. They couldn‚Äôt be more different, and I love that. The ride of the Cloudboom is so comfortable, and natural, and plush but with rebound. This is a at all pace shoe, I did some flat out digs, and also a 1 mile warm up at a light jog. It all felt stable and comfortable. I will undoubtedly have to buy a second pair, if I continue to use these to take out the trash. For 300.00 with tax in the US for me thats a fair price. On made a great shoe, tried something different, as they continue to do (The Light Spray looks insane). Innovation always wins. 

If you have any questions or anything I could clarify, please let me know.

1el6lwg,trailrunning,Trail shoe advice ,"I know this topic gets beat like a dead horse but I‚Äôve reached the end of the internet and still can‚Äôt find what I‚Äôm looking for. 

my road shoes are  brooks glycerine and adrenaline‚Äôs in size 13 normal width. I love them and they fit me perfectly.  Seeing as how brooks have served me well I bought a pair of brooks cascadia 16s to run trails in, generally between 10-20 miles nothing technical a lot of mountain bike single track a mix of dirt and loose rocks with what I would describe as rolling hills.

The cascadia‚Äôs feel great on my feet other than the fact they feel like they weigh 100 pounds apiece. I swear I hit every root, rock or stump on the trail with them and almost eat it too many times to mention. I switched to running trails in my adrenaline‚Äôs but when it‚Äôs wet or sloppy I have no traction. 

I live two plus hours away from a city with a major running store so I can‚Äôt just go try on shoes with ease. Also I have found that with shoes that run small I can‚Äôt size up by .5 because the are no 13.5s and 14s are too big.

I was hoping that someone has been in the same situation as me and has a recommendation. 

I‚Äôve tried running roads in the Hoka Arahi and absolutely loved everything about that shoe other that the blister that formed on the inside of my arch at 6+ miles so I don‚Äôt know if Hoka trail shoes would work. 

Any advice would be appreciated. ",2024-08-06 02:36:58+00:00,0,4

1ekxxx3,bunions,Shoe to big??,"I am 7 1/2 weeks post bunion surgery, I have been going to PT for 3 weeks and I returned tot work last week (Wednesday and Thursday). I am a CNA and I work 3 12hr shifts at a hospital. 
While at work my left foot (surgery foot) did get swollen (I never experienced any pain) but I put an ice pack several times during my shift and that really helped. My surgeon did tell me that it‚Äôs normal for swelling to occur for a tee months after surgery. 

I decided to new pair of shoes because I‚Äôve had my hokas for almost two years and my crocs aren‚Äôt very supportive. I went to fleet feet and they did a foot scan. The scan determined that my left foot is a size 9.1 and my right is a size 8.9. The hokas were 8.5 and both of my feet were hurting after work. 
I shower the salesman the scan and explained my concerns. He came back with a pair of hokas, bondies and a pair of saucony, triumph 22, both in size 10. I tried them both on and decided on the saucony‚Äôs. They felt great when I tried them on, my toes had plenty of room and my feet were stable. 
This afternoon I went to the gym and my workout was fine but I feel like I might have gotten a shoe size too big. I was worried that my right was going to slip out of the shoe and my left heel is now achy. It was a short workout so my foot didn‚Äôt have the opportunity to get swollen.
Should I exchange them for a smaller size?  Or is it better to keep the size because my foot is getting swollen?   ",2024-08-05 20:16:50+00:00,2,0

I'm at a crossroads now and could use some advice. Should I stick with what I know and get another pair of Speedgoat 5s, or is it worth experimenting with a different brand/model? If you recommend trying something new, what would you suggest that's similar in terms of fit and comfort?

These have been my daily beater for a year or so. Anything from 5k to half marathon has been covered. My first shoe that I properly got into running with. 

You may think I would like them or feel nostalgic towards them. After all, I completed my first half marathon in these (not my PB- I did this in endorphin pro 3). You would be wrong. They offer nothing. They‚Äôre not fast, there‚Äôs no pop and they aren‚Äôt very well cushioned so aren‚Äôt the best recovery shoe and the upper material is very thick. Comfy for walking in but having added other shoes to my rotation (Boston 12, endorphin pro 3, vaporfly 3 and all 3 are better at literally everything)  I‚Äôve realised how terrible they are. Just a dead shoe, and 389km is the end. My final run they felt like lead weights and my joints all ached after 8km so I truly believe the foam is dead.

1ei8gut,RunningShoeGeeks,Li-Ning Feidian 4 Challenger after 150km,"I realized that most of the people here mainly posted high-end and affordable Chinese shoes, and never saw Feidian 4 Challenger review. (I see F3C first impression only) Even though I have no picture, I hope this can be a helpful review for somebody who is curious.

So, I got this pair of shoes around May and I had run  a bit more than 150km, including one half-marathon event.

Following is the feeling so far:

1. Outsole - I feel like that these shoes provides a bit better grip than slightly worn-out Bondi 8 (400km+ used) or Asics Nimbus Lite 3. Not as great as Adidas Boston 11 (it's ripped after 120km though). Generally, you can expect decent grip and the durability so far is a bit better than acceptable.

2. Midsole - I believe they use same type of material as other world-famous brand (like PEBA?), and the feeling of cushion is springy, a bit like Endorphin Speed 3 (FYI, I never had this. I only tried in the shop). The deformation rate is more than my expectation and with its softer properties, I can feel little bit of instability on my ankle at any speed. If you're more counting on stability of the shoes itself, I'd recommend to avoid this shoes.

3. Upper - The upper does not stretch at all. And it's really really thin. You can see the color of the insole or your socks. It's like covering the whole area with thinnest part of Boston 11. Still, the durability was not a concern so far. The heel has some padding, thicker than Adidas Boston series. Your heel will feel more comfortable than most of the speed trainer.

4. Plate - This is my first carbon plated shoes, and I'd recommend this one for anyone who want to try carbon-plated shoes for the first time. With combination of the extra soft midsole, these shoes will give you comfortable thrust, sacrificing a bit of stability.

5. Price - I acquired this shoes from AliExpress Li-ning official store. I paid USD 105 and import tax as an addition.

6. Recommendation - I'd say this is recommendable for people who is looking for comfortable, plated tempo-run shoes which gives extra thrust force. However, you shall have some experience with shoes without 'stability system' as these will give you no frills for your ankle besides its thicker-than-average heel padding.

  
I do not wear these shoes for jogging and I mostly jog. My monthly mileage is approximately 200-220 km.

  
For those who is curious, my personal info:

1ehq4xa,RunningShoeGeeks,Superblast 2 100 Mile Review - Major Improvement,"**Total distance ran:**

106 miles (170km)

**Type of runs:**

I ran almost exclusively in these shoes for the last 3 weeks, apart from a couple races and track sessions.

Anything between 4 and 18 miles, paces between easy/recovery (5:45 - 6:16 min/km), MP (5:15-5:30 min/km) to treshold (4:20-4:30 min/km).

**Weather ran in:**

Surprisingly we had proper summer weather in the least 3 weeks so mostly hot and dry. I did a couple runs in rain as well just for good measure.

**My profile:**

184 cm (6 ft)

79 kg (174 lbs)

Strong forefoot striker (slam the ground and bounce right back off type)

Averaging 30-60 miles a week depending on training load

**Positives:**

* Very comfortable upper and no excessive volume
* Good lacing system
* Soft and resilient foam
* Good grip
* Works out of the box - no more 50 mile break-in period

**Negatives:**

* Price - I will get to that later
* Size of midsole in the heel is a bit too intrusive
* Difficult to get a good lockdown
* Materials in the upper are too... slippery
* No choice of colourways
* Poor availability again (but better than v1)

**Overview:**

I will start by saying that I bought the OG Superblast not long after it came out and returned it after less than 50 miles. It felt clunky, too big, I didn't understand the foam. It was firm, but also mushy, I just couldn't figure it out. I know that people say that it has a long break-in period but that is just not acceptable in 2024 with modern foams, especially not in a ¬£200 shoe. I am expecting my shoes to work straight out of the box or after maximum of 2-3 runs. Superblasts still didn't so they went back. I was sceptical about Superblast 2 but the more leaks and reviews started coming out, the more I was convinced I want to try them. 

Most reviewers said it was a minor improvement, I highly disagree with that. In my opinion Superblast 2 is a massive improvement over Superblast 1.

Firstly I'll start with the midsole. The new foam feels nothing like the the original. AND FINALLY IT WORKS OUT OF THE BOX! Finally people don't have to tell me that I should endure a clunky shoe for 60 miles just to enjoy them. It's softer, it's gives more back. It just works (I hated when people were saying that about Superblast 1). Do not get me wrong, it's nothing too exciting but it does the job and it does it well. One thing about the midsole that did surprise me is that the midsole is quite stiff for a non-plated shoe. Almost like it had a plastic plate in it. I'm not sure if it is the adhesive between the layers or the bottom layer itself. A few other people I know mentioned this to me as well so I don't think it's just me. If I didn't know any better, I'd say there is a nylon plate in there. It's not a good or bad thing really, it's just surprising to see.

Outsole is another major improvement. I didn't trust the one on SB1 at all. SB2 outsole gets a solid A for grip. I ran on tarmac, concrete, dirt roads and light trails. Dry and wet. No issues so far. It's not Puma Grip tier, but it's good.

Upper changes are very welcome. Superblast 1 had too much volume in it. Superblast 2 has just the right amount. I said earlier that the materials are a bit slippery if that makes any sense. It's easy for the foot to slide around inside. That proves challenging in getting a good lockdown. Tie the laces a bit too loose and I'm getting hotspots and rubbing. When I get it right I get no issues. It takes a few runs to figure it out. Room for improvement there. Fits TTS. I am a UK size 9 in anything but Hoka and SB2 fits perfectly in UK size 9.

My only gripe with the shoe is still the size of the midsole in the heel. It's enormous and gets in the way sometimes. Personally I don't need a platform this wide and I'd prefer a narrower heel but I get that many people would be displeased with that because it would lose some stability.

Overall a comfortable and versatile training shoe. Again there are no fireworks here, but it feels good to train in. It's light, it can go long and it can go a bit faster. I approve (but not really - more on that next).

**Worth buying?:** 

Yes, but only if you have sufficient budget. Regardless of being very good shoe, I believe they come out poorly in a value for money comparison against the competitors. They barely ever go on sale and when they do, it's 10-15% tops. Superblast 1 are still sold at full RRP a month after SB2 release. Frankly speaking, if my choice was dictated purely by cost, Superblast would not even be in the top 3.

I get what Asics are doing by positioning this as the ultimate premium tier trainer and running the scarcity sales model. But it's bad for the customer and I can't get behind and defend that. RRP can often be ignored because most shoes end up on 30-40% discounts sooner or later. Superblasts don't and that's why I can't fully recommend them. The shoes I used for the same purpose before (Speed 3) cost me ¬£90. The ones before were under ¬£100 as well. Superblasts 2 cost me ¬£180 and I don't think I got ¬£80 worth more of a shoe. I don't think it's going to last 80% longer, it's doesn't perform 80% better.

I can stand by this shoe, but not it's price tag.",2024-08-01 19:57:33+00:00,167,94

1ehcr40,trailrunning,Road to trail shoes (beginner),"Hey guys, I‚Äôm a beginner trail runner and I‚Äôm training for a 15K race. The race starts and ends with ~3km on the road, so pretty much a third of the race. 

I‚Äôm mostly training on a treadmill and doing some sprints up a jungle hill. I am looking for shoes that I can use for both treadmill training and trail running (and the actual race) - if that makes sense?

I definitely need some cushioning for the road part as my feet get tired on hard grounds. I‚Äôm totally fine on trails. I tried quite a few different shoes but am not sure about the road to trail part.

I tried altra lone peak - can‚Äôt wear these on the road.

I tried the Hoka Speedgoat 5, they‚Äôre ok but not the best fit for my feet.

Nike Pegasus Trail 5 - I liked the fit, but read mixed reviews about the grip. But they seem to be a good combo of road/trail.

I l‚Äôreally liked the Asics Trabuco Max 2, just not sure about the road part again. I also really like the Asics Kayano 30, but I guess they‚Äôre not made for trail running. Should I get them separately to run on roads and treadmill?

Any other suggestions? Much appreciate your input, thanks!

1egmur3,RunningShoeGeeks,Saycony Endorphin Elite - 150 miles review,"I wrote this 40 km (30 ish miles) review of the endorphin elite: [https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/comments/1by9w4s/saucony\_endorphin\_elite\_40kmberlin\_half\_review/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/comments/1by9w4s/saucony_endorphin_elite_40kmberlin_half_review/) 4 months ago and wanted to do a follow up review. Now that is has a lot of miles in it and a marathon under the belt too.

**Background:** 6'4/194 cm 77kg 1:28 half marathon,  39 10k and  3:12 marathon runner. Normally running in NB 860/Brooks adrenaline/hyperion gts due to over pronation. Used Adidas adizero pro 2 for last two years of racing but it needed replacement. Running 40 miles/60km per week now. I run in my training shoes with insoles while the racing shoes both adidas and endorphin elite are run in without. The insole in the elite is SOLID and cannot be removed for those wondering

**Feel:** It has soften up a tiny bit but it is definitely still one of the firmer rides/super shoes - without being actually firm. Rocker is noticeable but even for me a a heel/midfoot lander it feels ok.

**Fit:** Fits fairly true to size. I use 47,5 in Brooks/NB and 47 in saycony (but they dont have a 47,5 in their system just like asics don't either), I think it depends if company is US/EU based. It is (for me) unfortunately NOT as narrow as the Pro4, which i think for 95% of all people is a plus, while for me it is a negative as I have to find shoes that are extremely narrow. Lockdown is good but if I tie too much it hurts over the top of the foot. 

**Ride:** Amazing, i just LOVE running in this shoe! You will not find a supershoe this stable on the market, the high sidewalls makes it feel like i have my insoles in and i can take the corners will full speed whereas the Adidas 2 is a lot more sketchy! If you are a stability runner, I can really recommend this, but also for everyone else too.  It is also very well ventilated!

I tried on when i bought them the: Adidas Pro 3, Pro 4, Hoka Cielo, Puma something (not the new nice one), Asics metaspeed.

**Wear and tear:** Even with the exposed foam no wear to notice so far everything is good. 

  
**Conclusion:** Amazing shoe for races/intervals/tempo. Incredibly stable. I have even gotten out and got a 2nd. pair for 2025+ as i fair they will go out of stock with version 2 coming out. ",2024-07-31 13:12:53+00:00,20,17

1efhi9q,RunningShoeGeeks,Merrell Agility Peak 5 500km review (also Merrell Long Sky 2 Matryx 200km review),"Hello all. I‚Äôve been hunting for the best\* trail runners for the past 2 years and I think I can safely say I‚Äôm settled with Merrell AP5/LS2.

There are not so many reviews online about these two shoes (not to mention most reviews focus on out of box / short-term performance which is arguably irrelevant to me. As such, I thought I write something about MY thoughts and MY usage.

**Context:** I‚Äôm a weekend warrior live in Sydney AU that has a full time job, so most of time I can only do my local trails on weekends (I‚Äôd say at most once per fortnight in general). I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm a trail runner (or a runner) - I can trail run sections of trails and hike the rest, so I‚Äôm more a fast hiker.¬†

My sweet spot is 20km - 30km (often with elevation gains between 1000m - 2000m). Longest have done is 50km. Never competed nor have the intention to do so. I have run half marathron on road (again, not in a competition setting) and don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever do full marathon.



**What I want/need in a trail running shoe:**

* Durability per $ - I‚Äôm not sponsored so I need to buy them with my own money. I don‚Äôt use it that often so want something can last a while. I purchased AP5 at US$85 and LS2M US$60.
* Good outsole traction - In sydney the trail can be rocky/muddy/wet, so traction is always important.
* Weight - the lighter the better (but I wouldn‚Äôt pursue weight at the cost of above)
* Low stack height - I don‚Äôt like max cushion shoes (yes I know AP5 is one). I think 30mm is the maximum I‚Äôll get.
* Versatility - I‚Äôm a onebag/minimalist traveller so I want one shoe to do many things (driving, city walk, etc).

I have been extensively training for the TMB fastpacking (aim for 6 days) for the past 6 months, so I have logged at least 500km using AP5 and 200km using LS2. I plan to keep using AP5 for TMB and other hikes in the alps for a 2 month trip (total distance will be 500km trail + 200km urban). At the end of the day, AP5 should log 1500km, if it breaks, I‚Äôll probably get Salomon Genesis on the spot. After this trip, there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm hiking/runing at this rate. I‚Äôd say once per fortnight/month (i.e., 300 - 500km per year) is a more realistic estimate.¬†



**Overall Impression**

**AP5**

This is a ok shoe at best. Nothing amazing to be honest, but ok to an extent that you can just use it without thinking about it. It has a very high stack height with long lugs. Some people compared it to Speedgoat 5 but I‚Äôd say they are very different - SG5 is noticeable lower to the ground and much more stable.¬†

I like a lot about SG5 in terms of fit (I have narrow feet) and it is arguably one of the best fitting shoes, but I‚Äôm concerned about its overall durability. This is also the main reason I got the AP5 (following advice from Run4Adventure)

AP5, on the other hand, has a much more volume upper (not wider, but with more vertical space). The material used is more substantial than SG5 so the durability is amazing so far. I have also used it for half marathon and it feels very nice (although with 5mm lugs)

**LS2M**

I purchased this shoe mainly because the deal is crazy (don‚Äôt know how but 60% off after 4 months the shoe is released??). This shoe also ticks all boxes - low stack height, Matryx upper, Vibram¬†¬†Megagrip for $60. Incredible. In fact, I purchased another pair immediately after.

In short, this shoe fits amazingly - the upper is much more dialed in, I can feel the ground. The only problem with the shoe is the heel cup - it is very rigid so occassionally I can feel it rubs my heel. Again, I don‚Äôt do ultra stuff so at 25km it is totally fine (trail and road).



**Upper**

**AP5**

Again, the upper is just ok, nothing fancy.

**LS2M**

It uses Matryx upper which arguably is the best upper on the market. It is super light and breathable yet with amazing abrasive resistance. It does feel rigid and will need to break in. Also, it is not a good material for winter (but in Sydney we don‚Äôt have the real winter so it was ok).



**Midsole**

AP5 and LS2M both use floatpro midsole which Merrell doesn‚Äôt disclose anything technical. Based on online search, it is an EVA based midsole (aka the lower end stuff). It is definitely on the stiffer end (people say SG5 is stiff, I‚Äôd say floatpro is even stiffer). With that being said, all these fancy supercritical foam (like ZoomX) will not last (i.e., after probably 200km it will feel the same as EVA). I‚Äôm not looking for a performance orientated shoe so EVA will do the job just fine (also it is cheap which is probably why I can get mine at $60).

People say Merrell has different formulae for floatpro in its different shoes, but I doubt they are different in AP5/LS2M.

It is also worth noting that in freezing temperature the midsole is noticeably stiffer (than what it is originally), which again is an expected outcome for EVA.

LS2M also has a TPU based (similar to Adidas boost) insole which is very nice. TPU is also arguably the most durable midsole material.



**Outsole**

They are both Vibram Megagrip and they feel the same. AP5 has traction lugs and LS2M doesn‚Äôt. I personally can‚Äôt tell any difference these little studs provide.

I don‚Äôt know if it perceived or not but the 5mm lugs on AP5 is noticeably pronounced than SG5, also the rubber on SG5 feels softer. In any case, it is probably about the overall feeling of the shoe but not the lugs.

The rubber coverage is almost full cover which is something I like a lot - it provides durability at cost of weight/performancce.¬†



**Other bits and pieces**

* None of the shoes has reflection material which is a bummer
* AP5 has gaitor attachment points which I personally don‚Äôt care
* AP5 has heel loop which again I don‚Äôt care.
* AP5 has laminated plastic thingy around the upper which I do like a lot - it saved me a few times from shallow river crossing.
* LS2M has the best color combo I‚Äôve seen in ANY shoes - give me that white/orange/pink all day please (it is also partly why I get a second pair)
* LS2M has very thick shoe laces that can be tough to tie, but once tied, it will stay put forever
* AP5 and LS2M both have lace storage loop which is amazing. I don‚Äôt understand why not every shoe maker provides it.
* None of the shoes has full gusseted tongue (both semi-gusseted) which is acceptable but not ideal.
* LS2M is a much better driving shoe because you can feel the pedal more.
* LS2M is also an amazing slip-on shoe - the Matryx upper will maintain the interity of the shoe with lace untied - perfect for post run recovery.

In conclusion, I‚Äôm confident that the two pairs of LS2M I have can easily last me another 2 - 3 years. I really hope Merrell can keep this shoe going so that I don‚Äôt need to worry about shoes again. AP5 on the other hand is an ok shoe - I don‚Äôt ‚Äúlove‚Äù it but I don‚Äôt mind it being my only shoe.

I have consulted the following reviews before purchase and my personal feedback:

* Road trail run: Mike P/Jeff V nailed the comments about both shoes, especially Mike P on LS2M.
* Believe in the run: I don‚Äôt like their review - they said LS2M needs more foam, which is an absolutely toxic comment.
* Runrepeat: they have an interesting testing methodology which I can‚Äôt say I 100% agree (e.g., is it true that Hoka Torrent is LOWER than SG5??)
* Run4Advanture: probably partly why I got both shoes (i.e., AP5 is a substitute for SG5 and LS2M is a lower stacked AP5).

1efbbno,sesamoid,Chronic Sesamoid Pain - Help!,"Hey everyone. 

I've struggled with pain in my sesamoid since I was in sixth grade (2012). I was an active soccer player my entire life. I started experiencing throbbing pain under my left big toe joint with red swelling. I went to the doctor and was diagnosed with sesamoiditis. From there, I was putting a boot and was non-weight-bearing and the problem did not reoccur. 

Now in January 2024 - training for a half marathon - I began experiencing severe pain in the same general area. I had ran a half marathon in 2020 and had no issues there so I found it surprising that the pain began again this time around. I went to the doctor and he found that I had a split tibial sesamoid on my left foot. He was not sure if I was bipartite or a fracture. I was put in a boot for 6 weeks and afterwards he encouraged I purchase 500 dollar custom insoles. I did not purchase these at the time because they are expensive. 

I have new Hokas that help make the pain manageable, but after long runs, I find myself experiencing pain, especially at night. I am worried about arthritis. asking for anyone with experience to add any insight, I am desperate. ",2024-07-29 21:22:46+00:00,4,6

I need to buy a pair of trail shoes and after alot of reading different reviews I think I‚Äôve narrowed it down to three potential options.

To reach my nearest off road trail I need to run around 1/2 mile - 1 mile on the road.  After this, it‚Äôs a mixture of grass/chalk/mud tracks and some gravel paths depending on the route. 

Hoka Speedgoat 6
Hoka Challenger 7

I had intended on getting the Speedgoat 6, but then read about how they wear down quick on tarmac.  Usually I would run max of 2 miles on tarmac to get to/from the off-road section.

1eds4m4,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Rocket X2-200 mile Review,"About me:  Late 40s, 185 lbs, mid/forefoot striker 3:20 FM, 1:30 HM, 5K :19 

Upper Longevity:
Could this be the most durable super-shoe out there?  There‚Äôs very little signs of wear on this shoe. I‚Äôve raced a few half marathons and have done tons of track work, treadmill, and long-runs in the Rocket X2. The upper material is very plasticky making it easy to clean, and long lasting vs mesh uppers. I probably prefer the mesh in terms of breathability tho. Very little wear to the treads and exposed foam. 

Midsole Longevity:
It‚Äôs probably lost a tiny bit of pep from when it was new but there‚Äôs still plenty of bounce. It could also be I‚Äôm just more used to it? The Rocket X2 is one of those shoes that allow you to run at faster paces with lower heart rate. Very efficient still at 200ish miles. It‚Äôs a firmer midsole compared to its contemporaries AP3 and VF, but really rewards you at quick tempos (sub 7 min/mile). I don‚Äôt like it for anything more than a half marathon but I‚Äôve seen it out there for plenty of fulls. FYI this midsole rewards forefoot and midfoot strikers. This shoe almost feels like a negative drop in the heel when standing. The sweet spot is in the forefoot when running. 

Fit and continued use:
I had initially ordered this TTS in US M11, but opted to size up to 11.5 as the fit is really tight!  The upper doesn‚Äôt stretch a whole lot and hasn‚Äôt really changed at all since my initial purchase just after its release. I‚Äôll probably continue to use these as a tempo and speedster for harder fartlek and progression runs up to 10 miles.  These are also amazing treadmill shoes for speed-work. This pair will easily go another 100-200 miles.  The weight is comparable to most other super shoes. Not the lightest, nowhere near the heaviest. 

Recommendations:
If you like a bouncy slightly firm midsole with a tight race fit you‚Äôll love the Rocket X2. Its durability is shockingly good compared to Hokas traditional offerings (Clifton 9/Bondi, Speedgoat et al) and other super shoes. The outsole while not the grippiest does hold up really well. Would I buy again?  I might at a lower price but there‚Äôs so many good option out there that I feel like I‚Äôd miss out on the next iteration as these will last quite a long time lol. If you‚Äôre on the fence it‚Äôs certainly a worthy high-value  buy that‚Äôs great for racing AND workouts due to its longevity.

1edg36g,sesamoid,"Bilateral sesamoiditis, 15 month post R sesamoidectomy after necrosis. A story of hope, a list of things that worked for me.","My symptoms first started in my R foot March or April of 2022 while training for a 10k, the main issue being stiffness in my R great toe and not being able to bend it without pain. I went to a doctor who took an x ray and misdiagnosed it as arthritis. A few months later, in August 2022, I went to a podiatrist who quickly recognized it as sesamoiditis. He initially told me to buy new Hoka shoes and keep resting. I did this for roughly 4 months, purposefully trying to rest, but I think we all know how difficult it can be to fully rest your foot, especially for more than a week or so, as sometimes you just simply *have* to walk here or there. Each time I‚Äôd return to the podiatrist, I would be scolded for not resting *enough* and sent back. During this period, he gave me steroid shots, a moon boot for 2 weeks, and I bought 2 new pairs of shoes of Hokas (The Mach 3 and Bondi, I believe).

Eventually, the pain didn‚Äôt go away and I was frustrated. January 2023, I had moved to a new area and went looking for an orthopedist. I scheduled with a ‚Äúsports orthopedist‚Äù and he MRI‚Äôd me and assured nothing was wrong after reviewing it, again scolding me for not resting enough saying that it will go away on its own. I remember leaving that appointment in tears. By chance, I had also hedged and scheduled with an orthopedist specializing in foot and ankle (I scheduled both as the latter had a long wait time). I brought him my MRI, and he promptly identified that my R lateral sesamoid had necrotized and had to come out. I got a second opinion from a radiologist friend, who confirmed that this is likely the case.

At this time, I also started feeling symptoms in my L foot, less toe bend pain and more so chronic achiness right at the sesamoid area, the doctor telling me this is likely because I‚Äôm likely overcompensating. While I was hesitant for surgery, I didn‚Äôt want this problem to worsen, and I underwent a R sesamoidectomy in April 2024.

Recovery took a while. I was in a soft cast and crutches for 2 weeks and then a sandal for a month. During all this time my L foot continued to hurt. My R foot gradually began to feel better by the 8 week mark, after doing physical therapy and resting. During this time I met with another podiatrist in my new area and finally sprang for the $450 insoles. These were worth it.

It is now 1 year and 3 months since surgery. My R foot (the initially painful one) is almost completely normal. My L foot is still symptomatic, but I had it MRI‚Äôd by my orthopedist and he didn‚Äôt even see signs of inflammation. Not sure what's up, but at this point, I can only assume my feet are just jacked and I need to deal with it.

This was the hardest thing I ever dealt with. I was a track runner in high school and in college, as well as hiker, lifter, pick up hooper, skateboarder, and very active literally all of the time. I had that taken away from me for a year and half. I am now at that point where I can walk as much as I want again, go on a short run run or play basketball once per week, and wear most of the shoes I used to wear, provided I can replace them with insoles. I will detail below what specifically worked for me:

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† SURGERY: No doubt about it, the surgery solved the problem. I had a fantastic surgeon, and am very blessed that I happened to move to the area for other reasons and found him. It was intimidating, but I would do it again 100x over. If you are in SE Florida and are thinking about it, DM me and I can give you his name and practice.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† CUSTOM INSOLES: I bought over 5 pairs of dancers pads, and tried to self create my own insoles with a pair of scissors. Finally springing for the expensive insoles was a gut punch, but it made a world of difference. I generally now only buy shoes in which I can replace the insoles (using dancer pads as needed, ideally for not longer than a few hours at a time). I am at a point now where I can wear cowboy boots again! Low heel and wide toe box, with an insole that comes out so I can put in my customs.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ALTRA RUNNING SHOES: I bought 5+ pairs of shoes throughout this ordeal. I learned that I had been wearing my sneakers and work shoes (business casual type shoes) a size and a half too small, a habit I picked up when playing football and wanting my cleats tight. Ideally, you should have way more room in the toe box. Hoka‚Äôs did not work for me, and Altra‚Äôs did not at first, but the [ALTRA VIA OLYMPUS](https://www.altrarunning.com/en-us/road/mens-via-olympus/AL0A82BW.html) was a gamechanger. Wearing these with my custom insoles has me walking pain free. I have not tried the new model 2, and likely will have to, but for now am still getting these from other places. I buy the all blacks so I can wear them with anything.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† PHYSICAL THERAPY/STRETCHING: Physical therapy was a mixed bag. My PT was kind of guessing, but I learned through it just how tight my calves are, and some stretches and strengthening that helps. I have a daily routine now of stretching my whole body for 5 min, ending with 4 minutes of stretching on a [calf block](https://www.amazon.com/Stretcher-Physical-Equipment-Fasciitis-Stretching/dp/B09GF2PRS3/ref=sr_1_7?crid=30Y43UNO3NZJ2&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.kysMKiWAa61JBWlCSUrN5XKGJAGduUKk1Q-HAL_GTRx46w8ZLQRQWfQS_Jh0i6LXK0cZnDMPVu3SVor1xxi8Zua8_exVdLBvKdTYK8RNpCLelCKVyxdbLqM8cZo84-9ubmis6Q-qn8nWY7Vcz9I6Td-p2VuP02V-GqJDmGNzgagYzXwx_Wbk05wAWD0LUJ_kwcmNnYQMyNJJKkJOdKcIyRMdAqzaLAFm5EzIhjG44JpOJvoqYYu0Llht1-gg-FKZIrcVLmVLu1e70Gi_EUboTmnNzqF-9aTeYpvOMj-9p9s.OZMP_KRwcmgZDtI5jV42-GLLTOiRYqifkWxCspd_apk&dib_tag=se&keywords=calf+stretch+block&qid=1722114394&sprefix=calf+stretch+bl%2Caps%2C104&sr=8-7), and 3 minutes of rolling out each foot on a lacrosse ball

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† BEACH WALKING/FOOT STRENGTHENING: In conjunction with PT, I found it important to try and make my feet stronger. I have very high arches. I found walking on the beach as often as possible, at least weekly, was great and made my feet feel strong, along with the arch slide technique [see this vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPMXrNdfz54), also with some other good tips, Bob and Brad are wonderful) and [towel grabs with my toes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEJYq1HBtHY). I found a lot of strengthening for plantar fascitis also helped with my sesamoid area pain.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† HOUSE SHOES: CROCS: Oofos did not work for me. My friend bought me a pair of crocs as a gag gift, and I was stunned that I was completely pain free in these. I have a pair for the house and to run errands in. I can walk miles in these things. Yeah they‚Äôre dorky, but I have no shame in the game. I can't walk barefoot anymore so have these on 24/7. All of my close friends are aware of my condition, so give me special permission to wear my sneakers in their house too when I go visit, which is appreciated.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FAITH, HOPE, GRATITUDE: God used this experience to draw me closer to Him. I am not healed 100%, likely never will be back to the place I was. However, this experience made me realize how much I staked my life and self-meaning on my body‚Äôs fitness and its health, which, sorry to tell you, is always fleeting as we age. Unfortunately, I had to learn this lesson now in my mid 20‚Äôs. At first, I was bitter, resentful, and depressed, and still am at times when I dwell on it too much. In the time I dealt with all of this, two close family members died, I moved states, and started new jobs while trying to complete night school. However, through all of this God showed me parts of my life I was neglecting, and I learned how to lean on Him and His promises for strength. I feel more well rounded now, have a much deeper appreciation for all parts of my life, empathy for those suffering, and have become a better friend, husband, son, and human through all of this. One day I will be in a place where I can run and jump as long and high as I want, and this hope gives me courage. For now, I can manage my pain to a point where I can do what I want to do, just in moderation. That is much better than where I was two years ago

¬†I am writing this with gratitude for this community. This condition sucks. It is crippling. Worse, none of your friends or family know what a sesamoid is and don‚Äôt understand. This subreddit was a refuge at times. Please always remember that there are thousands who have started feeling better, found relief, and didn‚Äôt come back to post. There is hope. You may not get where you want, but you can get to a place where things are better. The mystery is how do you mentally adjust for that. I wanted to write this post for all those who considered surgery, had surgery, or just needed to see how someone else experienced and recovered from this. Please feel free to ask any questions below.

‚Äúbut these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.‚Äù See John Chapter 3 for details.

1edbvzk,hiking,Recommendation Lightweight Hiking / Speedhiking Shoes,"I‚Äôm right now looking for a new pair of hiking shoes for rough alpine terrain. A little background. I‚Äôm quite experienced in high alpine terrain and have done numerous T5 hikes, sometimes with climbing sections up to II (UIAA) and Via Ferratas up to C. The last 15 years I have predominantly used trail running shoes (Salomon Speedcross, Hoka Speedgoat). I like the flexibility, agility and the lightweight of trail running shoes especially since I feel that my movements are not restricted and the close to ground feeling. Nevertheless there are situations where I feel I reached my limit with those for instance on snow fields (when not using microspikes), on extremely steep and brittle surfaces and more technical climbing sections.

So now I‚Äôm looking for a pair of lightweight hiking shoes or speed hiking shoes. Kind of a middle ground between hiking boots and trail running shoes. I had a look on the Salewa Pedroc Powertex and the Salomon X Ultra Alpine, which kind of fall into the category I‚Äôm looking for. Maybe somebody here has had the same issues and has some recommendations for me. ",2024-07-27 08:54:09+00:00,1,2

So light and great quality. Did a 5 mile which I planned as easy run. Could not run slow the shoe is light and give very good energy return. Soft, comfy and energetic. So turned out to be a Tempo run. The negatives - Not TTS, upper very plush with thick tongue but gets really hot even at 0500 in the morning. Don't feel this with any other shoe.. Main point is the statistics. I run quite hard.. High HR BUT my cadance was MUCH slower than I felt. One more point you do get tons of ground feel. This really surprised me because in the Boston 12 or Noosa 15 you have no ground feel. To summarise - Very comfortable shoe, not for really hot weather, despite the feeling of super foam you do the work so great for training but not for racing. ",2024-07-27 05:14:05+00:00,23,27
1ed07at,trailrunning,My thoughts on the new Hoka Speedgoat 6,"I was lucky to be able to demo a pair before they were released, and while I wasn't very impressed during the demo, my old pair of Speedgoat 5s were quickly wearing out and I needed a new pair of shoes before an upcoming race.

So far I've put about 150 miles into a new pair of Speedgoat 6 shoes in the past month including one race. Long story short, I'm really not impressed. It's not that they're ""bad"", they're just not ""great"". I've run in Speedgoats for about four years at this point, I liked the 3, loved the 4, and also loved the 5 but felt that the 5 did not last very long. To me, a new pair of Speedgoat 5 is an amazing trail runner, but after about 200 miles they really start to break down and feel ""sloppy"", way too soft, and really lose a lot of traction. Unfortunately, the new Speedgoat 6 went the opposite way. When I first tried them on I was amazed at how stiff they were, as if Birkenstock made a trail running shoe. While the stiffness has ebbed a little bit, they are still very stiff, especially compared to other shoes I've owned. I was hopeful that this stiffness would lead to more durability, but that's not what I'm finding. Parts of the sole are starting to come apart and some of the lugs are showing signs of detaching from the bottom of the shoe (see photos). Some of the lugs are already showing a surprising amount of wear for only 150 miles. The trails I run aren't that technical, mostly just Wasatch dirt. I've also been negatively surprised at how dirty they get, I'm not sure if its a new material or perhaps the light color of the shoe (the only color available at launch...) but at the end of every run I'm shocked how dirty they are compared to the 5 (see photos).

I can't really think of any positives besides maybe the price? $155 isn't cheap but perhaps is less than other flagship trail runners from other brands. The toe area might be a little bit wider which people might like but for me this leads to an insecure feeling going downhill. I don't like how the mid-foot is narrower, I really liked the stability and the wideness of the 5. This sneaker is not impressive, its just feels like a shoe. Like a platonic trail running shoe; nothing terrible but nothing that great IMO. It doesn't feel like a ""Speedgoat"" akin to the 3, 4, or 5. It's vastly different and doesn't seem like it's even related to the other versions.

TL;DR: I'm not impressed and probably will look for another ""daily driver"" after four years using various Speedgoat trail runners

1eci5wr,XXRunning,Fast but squishy shoe recs,"I'm looking for a faster training shoe with a lot of foam to help me get through my faster training sessions while minimising impact injury risk. Does anyone have any recommendations? I have racing shoes and recovery shoes, but the former I can't wear for my interval sessions without getting sore, and the latter don't have enough oomph to get through faster paces.

I live remote so I sort of have to take a punt on ordering something online, but I have been struggling reading reviews because a lot of reccs are from mens perspective.

My 1km Intervals are generally ~4min/km and I do some shorter faster stuff too. I have been looking at the new hoka skyward X because I love my Clifton 9s for slower stuff but I  haven't seen many reviews.

1ebsazu,RunningShoeGeeks,Superblast 2 - Updated thoughts,"Had my Sueprblast 2‚Äôs for two/three weeks now and had some updated thoughts from my initial view.

First up - definitely glad that I got them as they are a perfect daily trainer for my use case, and perfect for post gym/football session where they protect my already sore legs but still give me something back when ticking the legs over. My leg muscles and joints never feel sore post run in these shoes. My feet feel good also.

I definitely feel like you need to have purpose with your foot landing otherwise you don‚Äôt get the extra advantage that the foam provides.

I also think these are good for paces 4:00min/km and up. Not really anything special for anything faster than that for me - I just use my Rebel 2, Noosa Tri 14 or Speed 1‚Äôs for faster stuff mostly, and sometimes my AF1 and RC Elite 2

If there are any parents out there wanting to use these with a running pram, don‚Äôt haha. They don‚Äôt feel great when having to push a pram along. They also don‚Äôt feel great running uphill and running uphill with a pram is game over basically haha. Downhill is fine though. Flat ground js what you want with these (slight uphill good, big uphill not so much to me)

My brain is thinking these are almost like my OG Hoka Rincons, with the added benefit of giving more back and hopefully having the foam last a lot longer before flattening out, which I‚Äôm sure they will from all the reviews I‚Äôve seen of V1

The fit is also TTS but does have a high volume at the toes, so might feel like you can size down, but the angle of the toe curve might make that tricky as my big toe hits the side and I feel like even half a size down might cause some issues with rubbing there.

Overall takeaway - Don‚Äôt go into purchasing these thinking they will be this magical unicorn shoe that can be used for every type of run. They are absolutely versatile and can be used, but they definitely have specific use cases where they shine more (longer, steady stuff). I also feel like a fairer price in Aus should be $250-$280 and not $320.

Final thoughts - They are the shoe I want to wear on every run, so that tells me they were worth it (even if not a magical unicorn shoe)",2024-07-25 11:16:09+00:00,33,16

1eatk2n,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Cielo X1 First Run,"About me:
Male Late 40s
6‚Äô/200lbs
Marathon 3:30
Half 1:30
5k 19 mins
Midfoot striker

Cielo x1 First impressions
Why I went for these over Alpha Fly, and others-TBH The Cielo X1 was a bit of an impulse by after trying them on in my local running store. I was looking for a training shoe that I could push tempos for long runs (10-20 miles) that have good outsole durability AND will last a bit longer than most super shoes (ahem, Nike).  I initially was thinking Saucony EP4, or something similar (not in stock in the colorway I wanted/black and red). There were other options but here we are. 

Midsole- let‚Äôs start with the good stuff‚Ä¶this is a FUN shoe to run in. I took them out on a 10k tempo run and was shocked when I looked at my watch and saw that I was running at a 6:30 second mile with a relatively low heart rate thru the first mile.  The midsole is efficient and bouncy! Felt like I was running much slower which I think is a testament to what Hoka is doing with their foams of late. This isn‚Äôt a Clifton or Bondi. This shoe can move. They feel extremely propulsive and bouncy for being a large-ish shoe. The midsole makes this shoe really fun to run in. The plate doesn‚Äôt feel intrusive and the foam is really a perfect blend of being soft and compliant. Kudos Hoka!  Compared to the Saucony EP3/4, Rocket X, and Vaporfly these feel a little more comfy and for sure have more bounce. Like a lot of ‚Äúsuper shoes‚Äù they feel weird to walk in but great at pace. Also very stable for such a max stack shoe. Surprisingly so. 

Upper- the upper is kinda overdone IMO but it‚Äôs fun.  I love the mermaid style colorway lol. I get it, Hoka colorways aren‚Äôt for everyone. I dig it though. It was easily 82 degrees on my run today and no hot spots. The laces I think are fine in case you‚Äôre curious. They‚Äôre weird but they hold. I think Hoka will likely change them, but honestly the hype over the laces is overblown. Use a double knot. They work. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Outsole- The outsole is what honestly sold me on this. The rubber is plenty and I think I‚Äôll get an easy 200-300 miles out of this shoe. From what I‚Äôve read online I think folks are putting good miles on these without the foam dying or bottoming out (hello Clifton/Rincon). Again‚Ä¶kudos Hoka. You‚Äôre listening to your runners.  Grip is great.  I ran on a semi sandy path and didn‚Äôt feel the need to worry. 

Weight- Yes these are a bit weighty in my Men‚Äôs 11.5.  That being said I‚Äôm not running 2:30 minute marathons and need every single ounce to count. I honestly can‚Äôt feel the weight difference between these and other race/training shoes with a few exceptions. I really don‚Äôt see the weight being an issue. However, I think Hoka could easily shave weight with an Alphafly/Meta Speed style material on the upper to be a bit more competitive in the race world. I plan on using these as a long run training shoe cause why not?  They‚Äôre really fun. Like super fun to run in. I think they‚Äôll hold up as well to high miles. 

Price- Cmon Hoka. I these are about $25-$50 dollars too expensive. I nailed a great discount of 20% for these, so impulse buy here I come. However I‚Äôm not quite sure $275 is in most people‚Äôs budget. Either way I guess I got it like that so why not?  No good justification for another race/plated shoe. They just felt great!!

Competition/Comparisons- I‚Äôd say the closest thing to this shoe might be the NB SC Elite (similar price/weight is close), Prime X Strung 2 (heavier, more expensive, slower), or surprisingly the Alpha Fly. I honestly don‚Äôt think most people will really feel the weight as your favorite YouTuber may indicate unless your running elite paces for long distance. Alpha fly likely won‚Äôt hold up as long given the outsole coverage and tendency to get chewed up quickly. They also don‚Äôt make the slapping squishy sound that the Alpha Fly does. Who cares tho right?

Final 1st run thoughts- For a shoe with this kind of durability and bounce I think it‚Äôs a good buy for anyone in the 3-4 hour marathon range looking for a FUN plated racer or long distance cruiser that‚Äôs good at all speeds and wants to do training miles. 

Hoka is killing it of late with their foams and willingness to innovate and focus on durability compared to the last gen of shoes (Clifton 9, Rincon, Mach 5 et al). The next version of this will be super interesting and will give a lot of brands some serious competition. Looking forward to piling on more miles.

1ea8hcm,Sneakers,Most comfortable AND waterproof (or at least water repellent) sneakers ?,"Hi,

2 years ago I got my feet into a pair of ""Skechers Flex Advantage 4.0 - True Clarity"".

* from comfort perspective, they are definitely the best I've ever had (they have a ""memory foam"" insole). 
* they are presented as ""Waterproof"", which IRL translates to: *they don't get wet very vast*; so **good enough** also at this chapter.

**The problem** is that I'd like to try other brands, as the Skechers design is ... well.. um... Skechers... üôÇ  
And since I need at least some attempt of ""waterproofness"", that strikes a lot of options off my list.

**I'm about to try ""Nike Pegasus Trail 4 GORE-TEX"", ""Asics GEL-PULSE 15 GTX"" and ""Hoka Transport GORE-TEX"", in this order, see which one is comfortable enough.**

1ea129f,PlantarFasciitis,My plantar fasciitis is making me depressed,"I 22F don't know wtf to do anymore with my plantar fasciitis and it's making me depressed. For more clarification, in the past two years since I found out I had PF I've gained over 40 pounds while still watching what I eat because I can't manage to average out more than 3,000 steps a day! I'm in agonizing pain at my retail job where I'm not allowed to sit and I can't take it anymore!

I wore an orthopedic boot for two months straight, did everything I had to, also wearing hokas to try and relieve the pressure and nothing is working!! And every time I visit the doctor they tell me, ""I'm sorry that you have flat feet you'll just have to manage around it"" that's fkn impossible!

It's ruining my self esteem and mental  health that I can't get into the gym and lose the weight I've gained but most importantly how long does this continue for ! I keep reading online that for most people it heals. From what I've seen most people who get the cortisone shots regret it. What am I doing wrong !!!!

EDIT***

I am 5‚Äô1 and consume around 1,200-1,350 calories a day and many days it‚Äôs even less than that. I‚Äôve been pretty skinny/average most of my life. I‚Äôve calculated what my maintenance calories are and it‚Äôs about 1,600 calories for my height and fitness level which is actually pretty difficult to stay under 1,600 for most people, but I measure my food on a scale down to the seasonings for the past year. The fact of the matter is 3,000 steps in a day is absolutely sedentary and only those who wear some sort of step tracker daily would agree that 3,000 steps is almost nothing when spread throughout the entire day. Ive had the same diet for years and don‚Äôt eat processed foods, the only thing that has changed is my PF.",2024-07-23 06:43:36+00:00,60,72

1e91r6j,RunningShoeGeeks,Superblast 2: Slow runner report,"Ran 5 miles in the Superblast 2 today. First run.

Got my hands on the shoes from A Runner‚Äôs Mind, a local store in San Francisco, after two weeks of trying and repeated cancellations from Fleet Feet and Road Runner Sports.

Context:
59 yo, 164 lbs, 5‚Äô7. Running since 2019. Last HM was in Nov 2022, at a pace of 11:00 min/mile. I spent last year recovering from two hip injuries but was able to run 5-10 mpw for the last 12 months. I started training for a 2024 Fall HM this week with the goal of completing a full marathon next year (Spring). I have medium width flat feet (pancakes) and until recently used custom orthotics but have slowly been working my way off them as my feet and form become stronger. This run was without orthotics.

Run:
5 miles at a slow Zone 2 pace of 12:30 minutes/mile. The shoes felt light, protective and cushioned and supportive but not mushy. I was able to get into a steady comfortable pace that allowed me to just run. Super fun and exactly what I was hoping for.

Given my feet, I can‚Äôt run in shoes like the 1080v13 as my feet roll inward. NB SC Trainer, Hoka Skyward, etc all felt like too much shoe. The Novablast 4, which was my initial choice, was too firm at the heel, and I returned them after 12 miles. This is the most I‚Äôve spent on a running shoe and I wasn‚Äôt sure I would even benefit from it but given all the reviews, really wanted to try them.  

The shoes hold up to the hype IMHO. They are light, fun, stable-neutral, with just the right amount of cushion and response for long runs. They also responded well when I went down to 9:30 during strides and at the end so they seem very versatile with a large sweet spot for different paces.

My current rotation (which I am really happy with) includes the Nike Vomero 17 and Saucony Tempus for daily training, Endorphin Speed OG for workouts, Endorphin Speed 3 for races. The Superblast 2 is now my long distance training shoe for runs past an hour (up to 4-5?). 

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be buying any shoes for a while!

Sizing:
While a 9.5 in the Novablast 4 fit perfectly I did size up to 10 for the Superblast 2. The shoe is narrower and the taper around the toes can squeeze the big toe.

For reference I typically use a size 9.5 although I also had to size to a 10 for the Endorphin Speed 3.

Conclusion:
This is a great running shoe that seems versatile for slow up to tempo paces (and fast paces for me). It is a lot of shoe but less complicated feeling than other plated super trainers. I‚Äôve tried a lot of shoes over the last 6 months while waiting for these and glad I was patient. Other past favorites are the Hoka Mach 4 and 5, and Clifton 8 (early days).

I may not be the exact target market for the Superblast 2 but these should work great for me as I ramp up my training for the fall and hopefully, spring.

Hope this write up helps if you‚Äôre considering these shoes.

Last time a shoe fit me this nice was the NB leadville 1210's ,"If anyone really liked the New Balance 1210v2 leadvilles for that fit/last through the midfoot into forefoot give the TNF altamesa line a try. I haven't had a shoe fit this nicely since that one. I have the 300. Might get the 500 now for a standing around shoe. The altra timps are really comfy too with the standard footshape last they use but they fall apart faster than other ones I've tried.

Tried a mix of salomons (xa pro), merrels (moabs), hoka (speedgoat/stinson), adidas (terrex), altra (timp) over the years always looking for that magic combination of comfort, affordability, and durability. Main use is exploring, hiking, city use, and super slow 2-3mi laps at the gym. Most shoes tend to fit really tight in the top midfoot for me and if I size up to accommodate then either the heel or the forefoot gets too big. This fits pretty true to size with a secure heel and a nice toebox for me. The leadvilles v2 last they used fit me perfectly as well. I'm not a wide but most shoes will run narrow and most wides will be too wide. Hope this helps someone out there.",2024-07-20 18:58:50+00:00,5,0

1e6fiw6,beginnerrunning,Husband wants me to quit running.,"I started running about 6 months ago, but have been taking it more seriously in the sense that I'm training for races and gaining more mileage. Running is a sport my husband (who is very unfit and overweight) absolutely hates, and according to him, was never good at. All of my husband's friends have been doing cycling. I did a 5K last weekend and ever since my knees (especially the left knee) have been killing me. I've tried different shoes, stretch exercises, strength training, and none of it helps with the pain. Not even taking a few days off helps because once I start running again the pain comes back. Due to this, my husband is trying to convince me to quit running altogether. He wants me to switch to cycling because all his friends do it. And he said ""cycling is something I'm willing to do with you, but not running."" I've been getting really good at running lately and wanted to do a 10K in October. I even bought myself a new pair of Hoka's (my third pair of running shoes in 6 months). 

I'm devastated at the idea of quitting running forever. Cycling seems like more of an expensive sport and more of a time commitment. In my city, there aren't that many bike routes I can safely ride on, and the ones that are safe are very far from my house. I don't have time to drive out to these places to go on a bike ride because I work full-time and have a toddler. And I don't know anything about bikes, not even how to repair a flat tire.

I feel like my husband is right that I need to dial it down on the running. But I think he is getting jealous because here I am getting good at something he was never good at. You need to understand that my husband was never the most supportive of me whenever I wanted to try something new. He always wants to talk me out of it. At the 5K I did, he sat in the sidelines, and I could tell he felt out of place because, well, he loathes everything about running. As soon as I crossed the finished line, he started packing everything up because he wanted to leave immediately. He made it clear he did not want to be there. Also, I feel like he just wants to take up cycling because his friends are doing it too and he wants to better fit in. I don't know. 

Is he right and should I switch to cycling? I feel like cycling is too intimidating for me. The bikes are expensive to buy plus you have to keep doing maintenance on them. And I know I won't have the time to drive out to the far and few bike routes/trails in my city (most of them are in a different county actually). With running, I can just go. I do most of it in my neighborhood actually. No driving out to some special place.",2024-07-18 16:27:18+00:00,14,68

My doc ended up transitioning me to shoes. I‚Äôm cleared to do some short walks but nothing too crazy. I still do not have any pain, but minor discomfort in the area where the Evan‚Äôs osteotomy and bone graft has been. But that‚Äôs to be expected since I just started walking. I do hope it gets better over time though. I ice and elevate after I walk which helps a lot. Doc cleared me for low impact swimming in a pool and wants me to continue doing my at home physical therapy. Should be seeing him in a couple more weeks to check in. Walking is getting easier. My foot doesn‚Äôt feel as ‚Äúplanted‚Äù to the ground as it did before and my leg doesn‚Äôt feel as tight. I went from using crutches to one crutch to a cane and just ditched the cane after some time. I use my boot on days that my foot feels dead lol. I do feel like my gait is off or like I‚Äôm walking bowlegged though which everyone denies so hoping to get into in person physical therapy but other than that, things have been great. Does anyone have a recommendation on shoes? I just ordered some Brooks but would like to get Hokas and OnClouds soon too.

- Lapidus bunionectomy
- Evan‚Äôs calcaneal osteotomy with bone graft

The Nike's, New Balance's, Hoka's and Asics all look a little over the top or in your face to me or the no laces look futuristic. While the Allbirds, Peter Millar and Travis Matthews are close and I mainly like them in grey or white, when I am looking for a blue sneakers. Plus, all of these sneakers always have a white base.

1e5q15g,Sneakers,In need of a great sneaker,"I need some serious sneaker help.... I have wide toes, but a normal heel. Wide shoes fit great in the toe, but are always super loose in the heel. If they fit the heel, my pinky toe ends up busting out of the side after a few months. 

Next issue... I have a high arch

Next... I am pretty sure I have either plantar fasciitis or achilles tendonitis. The pain is primarily on my back side of my heel, not on the bottom, but stop short of the ankle. It worse in the morning or after long periods of sitting, but once I get moving, I'm often fine again. 

And finally, I am over weight, have a desk job 30 hours per week, but when I'm not at work, I'm always on my feet and on the move. 

I have tried zero shoes, hokas, new balance, and I'm sure a few more over the years and nothing has ever fit my feet or last more than a few months. I just bought a pair of sandels from Orthofeet that are amazing, but the sneakers didn't fit right, despite them saying they had a wide toe box. They also look like something my grandma would wear, so I guess add to the list that I would like them to look nice too! 

My most current sneaker is from Topo, bought in January. They fit okay, but seem to make my heel pain worse. Not to mention they're already falling apart.

I feel like I‚Äôve hit a plateau at about 9 miles on every one of my weekly long runs on trail. 

Mentally, heart rate & oxygen wise I absolutely feel that I could do double the distance I‚Äôm doing without pushing way over my limits. 
However, each time between 8-9 miles my lower body seems to give out in one way or another and I‚Äôm forced to end the run. 
I‚Äôm 29M and in decent shape with good overall strength. 
It seems to be various things. One day it will be an arch pain or arch area cramp,  the next a slightly rolled ankle and Achilles weakness or pain etc or just foot soreness that‚Äôs too much to go on. I usually walk at this point and sometimes even that is quite a chore. 
my problem seems to be isolated to my feet/ankles/achilles most prominently on the right side. 
I use Hoka speedgoats for my runs. 
My ankles are somewhat prone to rolling/minor sprains and my right one often does despite my attempts to be more careful or slow down on uneven terrain. 

Happy to hear any ankle, foot or Achilles exercise ideas or other exercises that would help! 

Also have been seeing that some people recommend lower stack height shoes to avoid rolling. That gives me a slight concern given the foot general soreness I tend to experience but I‚Äôm definitely open to trying it.

1e4xm62,RunningShoeGeeks,ASICS Superblast 2 Paris - Initial Thoughts ,"I never usually post on this sub, but felt compelled to after purchasing the ASICS Superblast 2 Paris. I‚Äôve been out on 3 runs with them so far - a 5k, 10k and an 18k. 

I‚Äôve been running for around 23 years (I‚Äôm 38 now) with varying levels of activity. In my early years of running it was to supplement my training for other sports (football/soccer, boxing and Muay Thai) so running probably wasn‚Äôt the main activity I was doing. 

I ran one marathon at 25 years old and then started BJJ and that has been my main sport until a recent injury to my hand meant that I can‚Äôt do much training expect running. 

This has actually turned into really a positive thing and in the last 6 months I‚Äôve started running 5 times a week with the goal of running a marathon again. 

I‚Äôve added various trainers to my rotation, but the Superblast 2 stand out as by far the best purchase I‚Äôve made. The midsole is super bouncy, with a great balance between cushion and response. They work so well at at a range of distances and especially well for longer runs. The Superblast 2 can work at a range of speeds too, I actually feel that they really come into their own when I pick up the pace. The outsole is stable and has a good level of grip, I‚Äôve been running in the rain recently and had no issues at all. The upper is soft, but feels durable and seems breathable from my initial runs. 

The fit is great and felt secure during all my runs so far. I also feel they fit true to size, I wear a 7.5UK in all my running shoes and the Superblast 2 fits well in this size. 

I know ¬£200 is a lot for a daily trainer (without a carbon plate), but I think that they are worth the price. Ideally they would be less, but I‚Äôve bought other trainers that are nowhere near as good for ¬£150. I actually managed to get a discount code and picked up the Superblast 2 for ¬£169.99. 

In my current rotation I currently have:
ASICS Metaspeed Edge+ for race day runs.

Adidas Takumi Sen 8 for Speed Work and shorter runs.

Hoka Bondi 8 for slow longer runs. 

The Superblast 2 seem to be a real step up in quality to all the trainers above, although I do really like the Metaspeed Edge+ and the Takumi Sen 8 too.

1e47l9z,trailrunning,Cushioned approach/trail shoes,"I am not really a trail runner, but I am writing here because I am looking for a cushioned shoe to use for hiking and rock climbing approaches, which, in the areas I mostly frequent, can be a mix of maintained trails, downed trees, and talus and scree fields. I currently wear La Sportiva TX4, but I noticed that I often develop metatarsalgia on my left foot after a couple of hours, especially downhill (despite having added a shock absorbing undersole). It feels they have little cushioning and I also think the heel-toe drop is very high, exacerbating the metatarsal pain.

I do wear HOKA Clifton as everyday walking shoes and for other sports, and those definitely help. So I was wondering if there is an hybrid trail running/approach shoe with enough cushioning, but that could retain some of the characteristics of a pure approach shoe: good traction and grip on 3th/4th class rock, some amount of stiffness and support for rocky and uneven terrain, enough durability for not getting shredded after the first outing.

I understand there's no product that fits all of that, anything will be a compromise. I was eying these models:

- HOKA Speedgoat 5/6

- Scarpa Rapid

- Merrel MQM

- Topo Athletic, not sure which model would be appropriate",2024-07-15 22:01:01+00:00,4,12

1e3vcya,hiking,"The Definitive, ""WHAT BOOTS SHOULD I GET?!"" Thread","This is a thread to give information on shoes and boots that will hopefully get stickied to reduce the regular threads of, ""What should I get?""

>Firstly, materials...

For uppers, you have full-grain leather, nubuck and suede leather, and synthetics.

Full-grain leather is going to be your highest-end, most durable material. It lasts a very long time and holds up very well. It's also water-resistant, and it's nearly waterproof when treated regularly. It breathes, but not as much as other materials (and only if you haven't treated them with wax, oil, or grease and instead used water-based products).

Nubuck and suede are somewhat similar, and they're both durable (to different extents). They don't take on waterproofing nearly as well as full-grain leather. They're typically thinner and more breathable, and often they're used simply as reinforcements. See: Perwanger leather for an interesting form of suede. 

Edit for clarification: Nubuck and suede are different in manufacturing techniques and durability. Nubuck does hold more durability than suede, a significant amount in some cases, though they can both be durable when done correctly. Suede will typically be seen on more luxury items, not so much on hiking items, though there are some exceptions.

The similarities I was speaking to were in regards to how poorly they take on waterproofing treatments. They are both good materials, however, for different purposes.

Synthetics are lightweight and highly breathable. They don't take on waterproofing well at all. They're typically less durable due to thinner materials and excessive seems.

Combination materials exist, and that basically just blends the qualities.

>Gore-Tex...

Only use Gore-Tex in boots. For trail runners, the collar is too low to prevent ingress of water. Then, your saturated shoes will take ages upon ages to dry.

For boots, Gore-Tex aids in their ability to handle inclement weather, and especially snow, quite well.

Gore-Tex, despite being breathable, is less breathable than a non-waterproof shoe or boot. If you'll be in above freezing temperatures with no risk of hypothermia, sometimes it is better to accept wet feet and walk your non-waterproof trail runners dry throughout the day. That way, your feet will not sit in a saturated shoe for an entire day; they will be in dry shoes at least part of the time.

>Secondly, midsoles...

Midsoles are either made of polyurethane (PU) or ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA).

PU is much more durable and used in high-end boots. It will never compress, lose shape, or lose bounce. It will eventually die from hydrolysis, which is the chemical reaction in which water trapped in the pores of the PU breaks the chemical bonds holding it together. This happens much faster in unused boots because compression from waking forces the water out. Boots with PU midsoles are often resolable.

EVA is cheaper, lighter, and squishier. It quickly compresses and kisses its shock absorption, though. These boots have much shorter lifespans, and they're often unable to be resoled.

>Thirdly, outsoles...

These vary a lot, so you'll have to do your own research into the kind of grip you need based on your environment.

>EDIT: Support... Added for clarification.

Most of the support in mid boots comes from the midsole and its rigidity. The more rigidity the midsole has, the more support it provides. Unless using full-leather backpacking and mountaineering boots, the collar of mid boots provides very little support. You don't see any significant gains in support due solely to shaft height until you get above the 8"" mark. At that point, you begin seeing gains. Even some 8"" boots provide minimal support.

For maximum support in a mid boot, look into models: Asolo TPS 535 LTH Evo; Asolo TPS 520 GV Evo; Scarpa Kinesis Pro GTX; Scarpa SL Active; Lowa Camino GTX; Zamberlan Vioz GTX/Vioz Lux GTX RR.

For maximum support, look into the Kenetrek Mountain Extreme *and* similar boots.

Other good, supportive boots exist. These are just ones that I'm aware of.

>Treatments...

Leather will need to be regularly treated, especially full-grain. This can be done with water-based products or traditional products, like beeswax, mink oil, and grease.

Water-based products will maintain breathability and waterproof very well, but they won't last as long a the surface gets scraped away.

Traditional products will last longer, but they may kill breathability or the ability to resole the boots.

Do your research before you treat your boots.

>Good treatments: Nikwax. Lowa Active Cream. Scarpa HS12. Kenetrek Boot Wax. Zamberlan Hydrobloc. Granger's Waterproofing Wax.

>Uses...

Boots are best suited to cold inclement weather, heavy packs, off trail where brush is a real concern, and for support for hypermobility disorders.

Trail runners are best suited to river crossings, lightweight packs, moving fast, drying quickly, and strong ankles (or ankles being strengthened).

>Fitment...

Go with what fits your feet best. Boots and shoes should be comfortable out of the box with no issues, such as slippage, hot spots, pinching, rubbing, pressure, etc. They should be *good to go* right away. You'll still have to break them in, but there should be no initial discomfort. Break them in gradually with work around the house, followed by yard work, followed by light hikes. After one or two weeks, depending upon the boot, they should be broken-in. Some all-leather boots may take a bit longer.

Try boots on at the end of the day when your feet are most swollen, wearing the thickest socks you intend to use for hiking. Take the insoles out and stand on them shoulder width apart. Your feet should fit within the outlines of the insoles with no overhang or excess space. There should be ‚Öì to ¬Ω inch of space between your longest toe and the end of the insole. This will give you a good idea of the fit before you even try on the boots.

>Brands...

The best brand is dependent solely upon YOU. What works for me very well may not work for you, or the next person, or the person after that. I have listed these brands because of their quality of manufacturing. It will be up to the user to decide what a ""good boot"" is for themselves, their needs, and their environments. No one boot is perfect for all things.

Boots... Asolo. Lowa. Scarpa. Zamberlan. Hanwag. Meindl. Kenetrek. La Sportiva (specific models unlisted).

Edit: Salewa was thrown in the ring by a poster below, and they appear to make quality boots from the sources I am viewing. Reviews appear positive, and I see evidence of use by sources I trust on boots.

>Best boots I've found... Asolo TPS 520 GV Evo. Asolo TPS 535 LTH Evo. Asolo Fugitive GTX. Lowa Camino GTX. Lowa Renegade GTX. Lowa Zephyr GTX. Scarpa Kinesis Pro GTX. Scarpa SL Active. Scarpa Zodiac Plus GTX. Zamberlan Vioz GTX / Vioz Lux GTX RR.

Trail runners... Altra. Asolo. Hoka. Lowa. Scarpa. Zamberlan. Saucony.

>Socks...

Darn Tough or Smartwool, always. I use Smartwool Lolo Trail socks. They're full cushion, so they soak up sweat really well and can do so for a long time before your feet feel gross. I strongly recommend at least midweight socks for boot usage.

I prefer \~60% merino wool blends. They appear to have the best combination of durability, thermoregulation, and moisture control.

Edit: Another poster mentioned toe socks. These are a viable option if you tend to get blisters on your toes.

>Gaiters...

Gaiters are of utmost importance in some environments, but especially snowy environments. They prevent water from leaching into your footwear.

Edit: Not all gaiters need to be waterproof. Some work *better* because they're not, but this is a very use-case specific item. Do your research and find what fits *your* needs.

>Foot powder... (Edited to add).

Try out foot powder! It soaks up sweat and reduces friction greatly. If you tend to have sweaty feet, or even if you don't, try out some foot powder. I like Gold Bond Triple Action, the one with menthol.

Make sure you test your products before going on the trails with them. You don't want an allergic reaction on the trails.

>Finally...

I hope this has been helpful. Hopefully, the mods will sticky this to create one place for discussing and researching footwear, which I hope will prevent frequent threads with the same questions over, and over, and over, and over again.

More will be added as new information, products, and studies come up.

1e37suv,AskDocs,Heel pain - when to see the doctor ,"Background - in early 50s, female, 5‚Äô2‚Äù, 142 pounds.  Desk job. 

History - right foot previous ruptured plantar fascia during softball (after plantar fasciitis) 6 or 7 years ago. In past year, I have lost 93 pounds.

Activity - walk 40 minutes to an hour daily 5-7 days a week while wearing Hokas with green super feet inserts (inserts per the recommendation of a podiatrist 15 years ago). 

Explanation of pain - I have heel pain at the base of my heel on the back side (I believe it is the bursa area). No recent injury to the foot or leg (or anywhere else) in the past year. The pain  isn‚Äôt below where the plantar fascia connects. My Achilles does not hurt. However, when I flex my foot upwards, the pain increases as the Achilles stretches to its limit.  I don‚Äôt have pain in its relaxed state but it is tender to the touch and feels almost a bit numb when I press on the bursa.  The pain has been present about 2 weeks. Some days seems worse than others.

1e2jv8f,RunningShoeGeeks,Midpacker Alphafly 3 Half Marathon long run in the park first run 2h:02m,"
After doing my first half marathon with a marketplace Alphafly 1 I became interested in the Alphafly 3. 

Male, 150 lbs, 5‚Äô8‚Äù, wide flat footed

While I love running in the Alphafly 1, the arch was a big problem after my first half marathon 1 month ago where I wanted them out of my feet immediately as leg soreness at that distance is pretty bad with whatever shoe as I‚Äôm still a mid packer I guess.

Alphafly 3 feels a lot like Alphafly 1 but no annoying arch, it‚Äôs also wider, a bit more stable and overall way more comfy. It doesn‚Äôt feel awkward while walking and while my legs were sore after the long run, I could keep them on without issue. 

During the run, they are really good for cruising even at my average 6:00/km pace. Generally pain free running and just a fun experience. Just a small rant, It‚Äôs still crazy shoe reviewers don‚Äôt consider this good for mid packers and I find that insane. If you heel strike (which I do lightly in this pace) you‚Äôre impacting a somewhat soft layer of zoomX and while toeing off isn‚Äôt as noticeable due to not giving the zoom pods enough force it‚Äôs still a responsive and smooth ride. 

Comparing it to my other shoes: 
Alphafly 3 Men‚Äôs size 9.5 

Endorphin Pro 3 M 9.5: 
Ok idk what is it about this shoe but these shoes drive my knees absolutely insane and reviewers say this is better for midpackers. I think the heel striking into a firmer foam is causing this for me. 

Hoka Cielo X1 M 9.0: They felt similar when I had them but I returned them because it‚Äôs heavier and there is an awkward heel striking spot that makes my legs even more fatigued. Also the worst laces. They were coming off during a long run. 

ASICS superblast M 9.0: I like these, they feel somewhat similar to the Alphafly 3 on landing but toe off isn‚Äôt as aggressive. In terms of leg fatigue they feel somewhat the same afterwards. 

Overall I love these shoes and I want to reserve them for my 10k race in September, half marathons in October, February and my first full marathon in May. The bowerman prototype colour way is absolute fire too.",2024-07-13 20:24:04+00:00,152,52

I thought I‚Äôd share a ‚Äúmini‚Äù review on these two and perhaps open discussion to people who have these or are interested in them. 

My shoe size: 10.5

Weight: 175 lbs

Type of running: road running 

Distances run: about 12 miles a week, casual runs

I just ‚Äúretired‚Äù my asics Novablast 3 after running 400+ miles in them.

I thought the Novablast felt pretty great right off the bat. The first 50 miles or so, they had an interesting bouncing feel to them that made them fun to run in. However, that feeling died out quickly and they ended up just feeling like a sturdy, bulky running shoe over time. They‚Äôre comfortable, but IMO, felt a bit firm.. however that same sensation made your feet feel protected. I‚Äôm prone to knee injuries and my knees always felt great in these. I never had any knee pain. 

I guess that same sturdy feeling is what made them last so long. I can still run in these but I felt it was time for something fresher. The biggest con from the Novablast IMO was the colorways, which I think are lacking from Asics. I also felt the top of the shoe was too firm and inelastic, but that‚Äôs just my opinion. Would I buy them again? Yes, if they had cooler colorways. But, I‚Äôd probably just jump to a superblast if I ever went back to Asics. 

This month, I decided to experiment and try something else. I ordered a New Balance Rebel V4 in my usual 10.5 size (this size has worked for me across asics/brooks/Hoka/Nike), and upon trying them on, thought they felt a bit too snug around my feet, just a tad bit too much... I was a little surprised considering this is my size for practically everything. 

I thought that it might just be the more elastic and thinner material used for the toe box having a more stretchy ‚Äúhugging effect‚Äù around my feet. It‚Äôs a very different feeling from the Novablast which felt a little more spacey. I didn‚Äôt feel my toes touching the front of the shoe, so thought I‚Äôd give them a chance to see if the thin material expanded a bit to give my feet some more room. 

My first run was a 4 mile casual run which ended in a bleeding heel. Not a great first run. It felt very odd running in these coming from the Novablast, they just feel totally different. 

So I thought that maybe I have to break these in a bit more.. 

I started only using long socks with these to avoid the heel cutting. Over the following 3 days, I went for light 15 minute jogs in them and they indeed did start to expand a bit as I had hoped. They don‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôre hugging my feet as tightly anymore.

It feels like my feet had to undergo a longer adjustment phase to them, unlike my experience with the Novablast and other shoes which mostly felt pretty great right away. 

Since then, I‚Äôve probably run about 16 total miles in my Rebel V4‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it might still be a little too early to conclude, but I‚Äôm losing hope in them. I just came back from my usual 4 mile run and my feet felt a lot more beat up than they did with the Novablast. I think the Novablast had more of a bounce to them more suited for road running (which I do). 

What I do like about the Rebel V4 is that they feel much lighter on your feet, and the colorways are fantastic IMO (probably the main reason I bought it, hehe). I‚Äôm still going to give them a few more weeks.. but my dominant thought at the moment is that I might have to downgrade the rebel‚Äôs to lightweight walking shoes. 

I was really excited for them and am a bit bummed.. but maybe things will get better?

1e0ztez,RunningShoeGeeks,Takumi sen 9 (short-term) review,"I am 178cm and 81kg. I have used these for 200m to 1600m reps. Easy pace is around 6:00/k and I have ran in these mostly around 3:30-4:30/k during my sessions. I have currently logged 32k and have used these for nothing else than my workouts, warming ups and cooldowns have been done in other shoes I bring with me.

Fit: tts (but long-ish) No, its not the widest shoe in the world but if I just lace them a little looser its perfectly fine for me and actually quite comfortable. Note that I have slightly wider feet (I needed a wide for the hoka mach 6 in the same size, standard killed my foot). The tongue does move a little on my runs but its not bothering me. I will include a pic (pic 4) of the space I have in the toebox in my TTS (9.5). I do have some additional length in the toebox, but its not irritating me and I would rather have the right fit in the midfoot and ‚Äúsides‚Äù of the toes.

Ride: it feels very fast and it is hard to explain what it really feels like. Resilient is the best word I guess. It has no big rocker or any other crazy stuff in the midsole, it lets you do the heavy lifting and I would rather have that in a speed shoe compared to having something that forces me to run a certain way. No other shoe I have made me able to hit my paces as easily as this one. The way the foam feels is quite satisfying and not really comparable to the other adizero shoes I own even though it is lightstrike pro. If anything it feels like a stripped down adios pro 3.

The grip is also exceptional, even in the rain I was able to grip the ground and put power down. This is something I value a lot as I hate shoes where I just loose energy due to not having the right amount of grip.

Of course stability is not great and at 30k I am starting to wear through the medial side on the right shoe (pic 2 &3), which is probably just a me problem. I will put some shoe goo on these spots and hope for the best. Normally I do not have any issues with wear from pronation in shoes, but I guess it is a combination of less stability and more power that is put into the shoes during my sessions with faster paces, causing more wear and more pronation. So if you really need stability in a shoe, I would probably stay away from this one and get a shoe like the adios pro 3 that is a little wider overall.

I got these for around ‚Ç¨100 in the EU a couple of months ago but they seem to be going oos now. I just got the takumi sen 10 to try out and am curious to see if I will wear through them as fast as these, if anyone has any experience: let me know please!

If anyone has questions, wants me to compare it to a specific shoe, or need anything else, let me know!

1e0vnmz,FootFunction,"Doctors leaving me in confusion. Scared, please help me","Hello, i am 23F. I am not overweight, i don‚Äôt drink, smoke, take recreational drugs, nor do i have preexisting conditions.

This started June 23rd, when upon bending in the morning, i felt a tingle and pain in my heel. I must note i am extremely active. I average around 30,000 steps M-F in bad shoes. I couldn‚Äôt afford to buy a new pair. I thought the feeling was odd and googled it, of course, I immediately see neuropathy. I spiraled mentally after that. Cried, didn‚Äôt eat, felt phantom pins and needles.. i worried myself physically ill. 

I got into the doctor immediately. He said i had plantar fasciitis with an early symptom of tingling in both heels. He sent me on my way, but i was not satisfied, so i got a second opinion. 

The second doctor did a full physical examination on me and concluded it was plantar fasciitis because of the texture of ‚Äúrope‚Äù within my plantar fascia. I continued to do stretches and wear my Hokas, and Hoka slides, 24/7. The tingling and pain eventually went up my calf. 

I went to the podiatrist a couple days ago, he did XRAYS on both feet and said i had plantar fasciitis as well. He said the plantar was making my calf tight, and in turn, my tight calf was aggravating my plantar. He suggested i may have some component of tarsal tunnel syndrome, but absolutely no neuropathy. He said to continue stretching and taking anti inflammatory medication, if worse I begin physical therapy. 

Does any of this sound plausible?? I have been worried to sickness. My feet, especially right, hurt with prolonged activity and standing. The tingles come after physical exertion and stop at my calf. I just need to know if I‚Äôm on the right path to getting better. I‚Äôve been so worried, please help. I would really appreciate it.",2024-07-11 18:15:08+00:00,2,23
1e0rxk5,sesamoid,Surgery or injection,"
Hi, it‚Äôs been 14 months now that I've been trying to heal from one of the worst injuries I've had: sesamoiditis. I had problems with a meniscus in my knee and thought there was no injury worse than a knee, but I was wrong.

I saw 3 podiatrists, 1 physiotherapist, my family doctor, a kinesiologist, and an orthopedic surgeon.

The first podiatrist thought it was a hammer toe, and I tried to fix that for 2 months before seeing another podiatrist who said it was metatarsal synovitis. He suggested cortisone injections. The first had no effect, and three months later, the second, done at a different angle, relieved me for only a few days. At that point, I read an article online describing almost all my symptoms, and I realized it might be sesamoiditis. When I mentioned it to my podiatrist, he disagreed and prescribed an MRI. The results confirmed it was indeed inflammation of the medial sesamoid bone. He still didn‚Äôt know what to do, so he recommended seeing another podiatrist. He wasted thousands of dollars and 6-7 months of my time.

For context, I got the MRI results in March 2024, and I've been in limbo since May 2023.

I then saw another podiatrist who said the shoes recommended by the previous podiatrists were not rigid enough and that I shouldn‚Äôt completely isolate my toe with a carbon plate and various cushions, as I had been doing for the last 6 months. He recommended Hoka shoes and taping. These helped, but it wasn‚Äôt enough. We then proceeded with orthopedic insoles costing $700. I have to say, the combination of Hoka shoes and insoles made a huge difference. I could slowly start doing mundane activities again, like going to Costco or the gym. However, the insoles came with their own issues. I had to go back for adjustments at least 4 times. Over time, I felt I developed plantar fasciitis in my other foot or even another minor sesamoiditis.

After an 8-month wait, I finally saw an orthopedic surgeon who proposed surgery to remove the problematic sesamoid bone. However, she mentioned the results are controversial, and there are risks of creating other problems later, like hallux valgus. She suggested another cortisone injection to see if it would be the final solution to eliminate the inflammation, but I‚Äôm very skeptical since the previous two were ineffective. I am really discouraged. I‚Äôm writing out of desperation; if anyone has an opinion on the surgery, I would appreciate your advice. Thanks.

1e0qss9,RunningShoeGeeks,Rabbit Dream Chaser - can they survive?,"I saw a shoe launch party launch recently (June 22, 2024) at my local Fleet Feet for the new Rabbit Dream Chaser running shoe, and my thoughts (without having bought the shoe) so far are: 

1. do Rabbits run like Hokas and if so why not just buy Hokas

2.  then I saw someone wondering whether they were manufactured by the same company as Hokas which reinforces point 1.

3. then if 2 is true, will Hokas sue Rabbit Dream Chaser the way it's happened in other industries (i.e. P&G's Gillette sues Schick maker Edgewell over razor ...

All of that said, how can a new shoe really take off in such a competitive space where running shoes are all mimicking Hokas. 

I remember when Altras came out and offered something radically different, but my own pair of newish Altras look like Hokas now too.

1e0pvwf,sesamoid,Don't leave your sesamoiditis untreated!,"Hi all, just wanted to post some information here based on my experience after suffering on and off with sesamoiditis for more than 15 years and only now receiving proper treatment for it.

The bottom line is: my sesamoiditis turned into arthritis (permanent degeneration of the cartilage). This is AVOIDABLE so please don't leave it untreated. Look for doctors who can actually help you ‚Äì keeping in mind that many don't know how!

My issue is biomechanical ‚Äì I have suffered the consequences of very high arches since 17 yo, such as metatarsal fractures, ankle issues and big toe pain, which has been debilitating at times. I've seen loads of professionals and have always been given insoles for arch support and supination, but no one ever addressed my left foot sesamoiditis until now :/

What I learned is that for those who suffer from chronic sesamoiditis, the ONLY treatment available besides (uncertain) surgery are **custom made insoles** plus **slippers that offload the sesamoid when at home.** Insoles for sesamoiditis have a hole to relieve pressure from the bone (called a dancer's pad). Get your insoles, pay the money, make sure they are perfect. That's the only real treatment. Physio helps, but without the insoles there's only so much it can do. In most cases, you can just go to a place where they make insoles and request this.

For slippers: get foam flip flops/ slippers (I use Archies) and produce a ""hole"" in the sesamoid area ‚Äì mark the area with a pencil; throw some boiling water there; press the marked point with your finger (protected from heat), or use a heated up spoon. This was such a game changer. There are also gel dancer's pad that can be temporarily attached to feet or shoes.

Complementary treatments:

* **Extra cushioned shoes** (such as Hoka Bondi SR)
* **Steroid injection:** short-term. relieves the pain from inflammation and may be needed, but has long term side effects and it's not advisable for arthritis. I personally avoid them
* **Physiotherapy**
* **TENS machine:** relieves pain, it's cheap and can be used at home
* **ESWT** (Extracorporeal shockwave therapy), really worth a try
* **Anti-inflammatory drugs:** doctors advised more than once to take the maximum dosage possible (on a full stomach) during a flare up and continue for some days as the pain starts to subside ‚Äì not suitable for certain cases, and definitely not long term. I personally avoid them
* **Taping**
* **Ice**

That's it. For a long time, I had no idea my big toe pain was sesamoiditis. And when I finally decided to spend with custom made insoles, I was given the wrong ones and did not vouch for myself until it was too late. Now the cartilage damage is done and there's no return ‚Äì so please don't do the same! With the right insoles, shoes, pain relief treatment, I'm starting to live a normal life again thank goodness, so just wanted to put this out there in case it helps someone else.",2024-07-11 14:10:39+00:00,31,40

1e05qny,sesamoid,Advice for Non-Union Sesamoid Fracture,"Hello! 

I have been lurking on here for a few months and am hoping to share my story and get some advice.

For context, I live in a small community on Vancouver Island Canada. Free general health care and decent orthopaedic options because it is a retirement community. I have health insurance through my partner's employer with pretty decent coverage. 

I have a non-union fracture in my right sesamoid. I have small feet with high arches and I used to dance and run regularly, so I'm a prime candidate for this injury. 

I have included my timeline below. 

**Timeline:**

**Fall of 2020:** Occasional foot pain. Notice when biking to work or on long distance hikes. At this time I was wearing ""barefoot"" shoes. Not sure if this contributed to the injury. 

**April 2021:** Asked physiotherapist off handedly about a dully pain in the ball of my foot. He figured it was sesamoiditis. I went to an orthopedist and had a temporary orthotic built up. **I fell off a small ladder, and we assumed this broke it at first. But upon further reflection I remember my foot hurting before that.** And frankly, the ladder wasn't that high. 

**May 2021:** X-ray found no signs of sesamoid fracture. They recommended another x ray with a sesamoid view but the doctor didn't tell me this. 

""Alignment of the forefoot is maintained. No fracture is seen. A tiny is peroneum is present""

Unfortunately I didn't know enough about the injury to advocate for more imaging at this time. My pain was pretty mild, but I made the decision to offload my foot based on what I had read online. 

**May 2021-August 2021:** Wore air cast and significantly reduced activities. I was a teacher so I took 3 weeks off work, worked a few weeks in the boot, and then had a very sedentary summer.

**September 2021:** Started transitioning back into normal activities. Over time able to tap dance, run, cross country ski, multi day trek, etc. without pain. However, throughout the injury it has hurt to do a lunge with my foot in a flexed position. I always wear Hoka shoes. 

**September 2022:** Got custom orthotics and found an orthopedist I love. 

**Fast forward to January 2024:** Notice some pain while cross country skiing (trad skiing). Update orthotics. Minimal issues with regular activities, which includes running 2x per week, downhill skiing, sports, etc. I never pushed it with running. I only ever ran on trails, 4 minutes running 1 minute walking, and never more than an hour. 

**May 2024:** Pain starts amping up again. Go to sports medicine physician. 

**X-ray results:** ""The medial first MTP sesamoid appears slightly fragmented at its proximal margin. There is also some increase in sclerosis of the sesamoids. the appearances are suggestive of acute sesamoiditis""

**Bone scan results: ""**Positive three phase bone scan of the right first lateral metatarsal head sesamoid with x ray changes that may favor sesamoid fracture over the differential consideration of sesamoiditis with hypermia""

We don't know if it's been fractured the whole time or not. No evidence of necrosis. Surgeon said this is a ""rare injury that won't heal and makes people miserable"" This made me spiral pretty hard and feel really hopeless. I spent time on this reddit and realized there are options I have not tried yet. 

**June 2024:** Pain is at a 4, so I go back into walking cast briefly because I was out of town and in pain. When I got home I went to the orthopedist. Turns out my orthotic had warped and was pressing right into my sesamoid. I am wondering if this is why my injury worsened. 

**July 2024:** I have good days and bad days. My pain ranges from 0-3. I have seen multiple physio therapists and think I have found a promising one. 

**As of July 2024, these are the interventions I am trying:**

* Recording my activities, interventions, and pain levels each day
* Ankle stretching and strengthening
* Balancing and walking exercises (I've started walking on the edges of my feet because of the injury)
* Daily contrast baths in evening. 1 minute ice 1 minute hot for 20 minutes.
* Elevating foot while working (I have a desk job now) 
* Icepack in morning and afternoon
* Wear shoes and orthotics at all times
* Focusing on areas of wellness that are in my control. Sleeping well, drinking lots of water, eating healthy and minimally processed foods, and daily stretching, strength training, and low impact cardio. 
* I have been experimenting with taping in a downward position. This seemed to be helpful when I was running. 
* I have also been experimenting with a toe spacer. I can't tell yet if this makes it better or worse. 
* I have an MRI scheduled for September 
* I find out this week if my insurance will cover an Exogen bone stimulator. Coverage is looking promising. 
* I have a consult in September with a specialist regarding ultrasound guided platelet rich plasma injections. My plan is to offload my foot again while receiving this treatment. 
* Throughout the whole process, I have only taken NSAIDs if I'm doing a more intense activity like a multi day hike. 
* I have consulted with a surgeon regarding a sesamoid removal and think I want to avoid this unless my pain gets so unbearable I can't walk.
* That electrical stimulation treatment I've seen some people post about isn't an option in my local community. 

**Here are some of the questions I have for fractured sesamoid veterans:**

* Is it too late for my bone to heal? The sports medicine doctor/orthopaedic surgeon don't see the point in me offloading. I want to give it a go when I get the PRP + Exogen treatments because I'm hoping these will stimulate healing. 
* There seems to be a lot of mixed info about the benefits of a walking cast vs offloading with crutches and a knee scooter. I am open to fully offloading but can't seem to get an answer. **How long should I offload for?** 
* **Can I swim while offloading?** 
* **What physio exercises were you recommended?** I see a lot of people talking about how physio helped them, but I've been to multiple physio therapists and haven't been given many exercises. Right now I am foam rolling my big toe tendon, doing a daily ankle mobility routine, walking slowly and focusing on proper form, and doing some balancing exercises while making sure my foot is grounded. 
* My most recent physio seems promising. She is wondering if my bone isn't healing because my big toe tendon is tight, and has given me exercises to loosen it. **Any thoughts on this hypothesis?** 
* If this doesn't heal, I want to try and continue keeping as active as possible. **Has anyone found interventions for biking and cross country skiing?** I'm thinking skate skiing might be better because it has a stiffer sole and isn't in such a flexed position. I've heard that cycling shoes are stiff soled and could help the injury. 
* My pain actually doesn't interfere terribly with my ability to do activities but I am so terrified of making things worse that I am really cautious about what I do. **Once I have offloaded again, if it still hasn't healed, is it realistic to tolerate a certain amount of pain?** 
* I feel conflicted when I listen to podcasts and read about how we are over treating feet. **Should I be trying to walk barefoot to strengthen my feet?** 
* **Any other advice, please, please share!** 

Most days I feel positive and focus on the things I can do, but it's hard not to feel depressed. I love sports, running, cross country skiing, and multi day hiking. It's a tiny, devastating little injury that people really don't understand. But I've got a great group of friends and a supportive family + partner, so we've been investigating activities I can still participate in. ",2024-07-10 20:16:36+00:00,3,23

I am considering: Asics Nimbus 26, Asics Cumulus 26, Adidas Ultraboost 1.0.  
I have looked at: Hoka Cliffton 9, Hoka Bondi 8, Hoka Transport (Transport because it seemed more walking oriented).

My concerns is that using a running shoe, that have been created for and meant for running, can cause problems, when used for walking such a long distance. However, all walking shoes i have found (Salomon seems interesting) are created for trail and hiking. I would like avoid shoes that are created for trail and hiking, when i will only be moving on a asphalt/concrete surface.

I have read probably read all reddit posts i can find about this subject and looked on all related websites, but i still don't feel that the subject of long walks on asphalt/concrete has been answered.

My questions are:   
- Should i focus on a running shoe instead of trail shoe?  
- Can you recommend any specific shoe for my case?

Any tips or suggestion are very welcome!

‚Ä¢ Sturdy for trails, mountain hikes, rocks, etc (in my experience )
‚Ä¢ Not hot, and my feet don‚Äôt sweat it them 
‚Ä¢ Nice feeling when wearing without socks 

Cons:
‚Ä¢ Can smell bad if you wet them a lot and don‚Äôt wear socks, or sweat a lot 
‚Ä¢ Ants could still bite you 
‚Ä¢ Pebbles could get in while walking? Has never happened 

I am constantly looking for the best hiking shoes. Hiking boots are too much (I have Moabs) Sneakers suffocate me, hokas make me feel unstable because they‚Äôre so chunky. Hate having to always wear socks. Chacos are too heavy, smell horrible, and the rubber is so hard on my feet. Exposed toes is scary to me. The toe thing chokes your toe. They always hurt me after a long day of wearing them. Teva straps give me blisters! To me, a water capability and breathability are so important to me and I think others, so I‚Äôd like some thoughts on why you guys don‚Äôt wear these more often!   

These and a light pair of sandals for camp (bedrocks?) seem like the way to go. Would love to hear your suggestions and combinations. ",2024-07-09 19:05:06+00:00,24,31

1dyxxrd,RunningShoeGeeks,ASICS Noosa Tri 15,"Size: USM9.5
Paid: 170AUD
Fit: TTS
Modifications: Custom orthotics for tin post support
First run 1: 6k easy(orange pair, custom foam orthotics)
First run 2: 4k at 4:50-5:00/km off the bike 

So, technically this is two first runs as I bought the orange pair on sale and immediately ordered the blue pair the next day. I may order a few more in the same size, if I can find them. You are probably intuiting that this was a positive first experience. It was!

I am at the end of the road for my beloved Hoka Rincon 3 and wanted a neutral, reasonably firm, rockered uptempo trainer that is not too heavy. And I am a cheap bastard. And I like loud colours. 

The rincon goes a bit flat but has actually held up in terms of outsole wear. But they‚Äôre not as lovely as when I got them and I‚Äôm only 300km on them. The Noosa Tri 15 has AHAR rubber, a bit more pop, Guidese geometry. I‚Äôve tried on a few other ASICS race shoes (metasky paris, etc) and they have no medial support. 

Both of my runs were actually pretty easy, I think maybe the fastest km I popped off was 4:40 or so.

Upper is super comfortable. Reasonably breathable. A bit wider than Hoka or Saucony but not a super wide shoe. My benchmark for fit is Topo and these are not as good but they‚Äôre not loosey goosey. And very comfortable. 

Midsole feels ‚ÄúSoft firm‚Äù with a bit of bounce before you start running. As soon as you start running they turn over and feel planted, and ‚Äúpoppy‚Äù but not bouncy. They also feel thin toward the front which is okay with me. 

Outsole grip seems okay. Haven‚Äôt used them in the rain yet. 

Ride overall is a bit more dynamic and although they aren‚Äôt bouncy, they have more energy return than the Rincon 3 they replace, without feeling tippy like some of the softer super foam shoes. With my foam orthotics, they feel less dynamic than with my rigid ones. I‚Äôd imagine with a new insole. made from a superfoam, this would be very close to a goldilocks shoe for me, but unfortunately post-covid my tib post tendons are pissed off again. Overall, super happy, and may well use this shoe ( a fresh pair) for the actual Noosa Tri in November!

1dyx2yg,RunningShoeGeeks,Mach 6 100km initial review,"M, 6ft2, 87kg HM: 1.27 Mar: 3:05 
Mainly a trail runner but will do road races occasionally through the year.. 
Other road shoes I have Saucony Triumph 20, On Cloud Surfer, Saucony endorphin pro 3


As title suggests thoughts on the Mach 6 after 100km. 
Picked up these shoes as was looking for a ‚Äúdo it all‚Äù shoe. I travel a lot for work so wanted a shoe that I could just throw in my bag and it be able to handle a bit of everything. Was specifically looking for a non plated option so decision was between these, NB rebel and superblast. Decided on these as couldn‚Äôt find superblast anywhere and these felt more comfortable that the NB. 

I‚Äôve done a bit of everything but some specific runs include (pace in min/km): 
Long run - 35km at 5:10-5:30 
Tempo - 13km at 4:30
Intervals - 1km repeats at 3:40
Recovery - 8km at 6:00 

How have they done?
Tbh I think they have pretty much hit the exact brief I had for them. Have handled pretty much all of the runs with no real issues. I think it‚Äôs a pretty classic statement of could find better shoes for each specific category but these are able to handle each of with no problem. 

I think of the above the category I probably wouldn‚Äôt use it again for would be recovery day but just as it‚Äôs a little firm for what I would like for recovery. 

Fit/ride/feel: 
Fit hasn‚Äôt been an issue for me but did go up half a size from my ‚Äúnormal‚Äù running shoes size so maybe worth trying on. This is my first Hoka shoe as have historically found every Hoka shoe I try on it feels like it‚Äôs digging into my Arch but no issues with that on this one. 
So overall on the foot comfortably, no rubbing or hot spots. I would say the upper is in the middle between a race upper and a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù daily trainer. Meaning it‚Äôs a bit stripped back, so maybe not as comfortable as a classic daily trainer but certainly a lot more comfortable than a race shoe. But overall no issues, would happy use for marathon if someone was looking for a non plated option. 

Grip has been fine even in the rain (been very wet in the UK and it‚Äôs had no issues that I have experienced). 

It has a pretty soft feeling when you stand/walk in them but found it firmed up quite a bit on the run. Wouldn‚Äôt say it is a firm shoe though. 
Shoe has a nice bounce/responsiveness to it with a nice rocker and the light weight overall just makes it an easy ride at pretty much any pace. 

Durability, seen no wear or breakdown of the shoe yet so happy to report all fine here. 

In summary what will I be using it for going forward? I think pretty much exactly what I bought it for. Will be a shoe I can take on a weekend away and it handle pretty much anything. When at home however will mainly be used as a daily trainer and long run shoe as found those the best suited for me. 

Additionally some thoughts on Hoka.
I admit I have historically been in the ‚ÄúHoka Hater‚Äù camp. Mainly just have never felt comfortable to me when trying them on, seem over priced and from what I have seen have never been very durable.
Have these shoes changed that? No, not yet anyway. I think they certainly may do but currently hasn‚Äôt changed my thought. I just am hesitant that they might start to break down quickly. There‚Äôs been no evidence of this happening yet but the foam underfoot just gives me that feeling (hope to be proven wrong though). 

Happy to answer any questions!

1dyeb2v,bunions,Shoe dilemma,"I got my lapidus surgery done Dec 2023. I‚Äôm mostly fully recovered other than a few minor mobility issues. 

The issue im having is that none of my shoes fit anymore. I have no swelling at all,they all just feel too small so I gave most of them away.

Yesterday I went out and bought Airmaxes in a size 10(which is one size above my usual). They fit in stores but now that im wearing them they feel too tight. Im not sure if I should return them or try to break them in.

Has anyone experienced this ? What did you do?  I only have two shoes that fit well at the moment, a pair of Jordan‚Äôs and a pair of Hoka‚Äôs.

I am eventually going to buy more shoes and Im not even sure how to go about it anymore.

1dydugq,hiking,Quality of Shoes Getting Worse?,"Hey guys! I just need to rant and get your opinion. I went on a big hiking trip in May and wanted to get some good shoes for it. I also hike a lot in general. Since I was traveling I opted for lighter trail runners that had come highly recommended online and were on sale at the time. I got a pair of Nike Pegasus 4s and a pair of Adidas Terrex Free Hikers 2.0 and loved them at first.

Then, a week into my training with the Nikes, part of the sole started coming off and so I exchanged them for a new pair. I haven't had issues since...

Then just this week I noticed the inside heel fabric part of my Adidas is ripped at the seam!

I've had these shoes for only 2.5 months and probably done 75-100 miles on each of them. Do I have terrible luck or is the quality of everything going down?  Nikes and Adidas are on my watch list. Next time I will just buy Merrells or Salomons.

Wow, the response to this has been way more than I expected, thanks for all the advice!

1dxvjwn,PlantarFasciitis,Rant: in so much pain ,"I‚Äôve had pain in my left heel since January. Went to the podiatrist in early June and got diagnosed with PF. He suggested running shoes 24/7, arch support insoles power step brand, stretching, Advil, and ice massages with a frozen water bottle. He also gave me a lidocaine shot which helped for maybe a couple days. I bought Hoka Clifton 9 shoes and they feel okay. I also have some vionic shoes for variety. 

I did a ballet workshop for a week in June and oddly enough, my pain was subsiding. 

Now for some reason, my pain today is a 10/10. Now even my knee on the other side is aching. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs from babying my foot too much. I‚Äôm at a loss. Tomorrow I go on a vacation to Costa Rica and I just want to have fun and not let my foot ruin things. 

I know I haven‚Äôt been 100% consistent. But please, drop your favorite remedies and maybe something that worked for you will work for me. I have a normal gait, medium arch, very minimal overpronation. 

I‚Äôm a tad overweight but muscular. I have a dance background and absolutely love exercising. Just wish it wasn‚Äôt so painful lately!

1dx1udk,trailrunning,Asics Fuji Lite 4 super underrated?,"Can‚Äôt see any discussion about this shoe. I recently caved to the hype and bought the Hoka Speedgoat 6 and have put 100km them or so. 

I think the ASICS Fuji Lite 4 (which I was using prior to the speedboats) beats them in pretty much every way. Better cushion, bounce and much cheaper ($140 AUD on sale). Grip is also very similar to the Hoka, slightly smaller lugs but more stable and feels nicer on gravel. The toe box is much more spacious too. 

Doesn‚Äôt seem like anyone else uses this shoe, any idea why? I guess they are kinda ugly. 
Alternatively, are the Speedgoat 6 just bad compared to previous versions? They feel incredibly stiff and almost painful to run in after 10km or so. ",2024-07-06 22:49:01+00:00,3,5
1dwyiwq,walking,some general questions about orthotics inserts and shoes | seeking advice,"Hello Walkers,

First time post in this subreddit. I have flat feet and wear custom made orthotics. These are 1/2 length types that go from the heel to about mid foot, just past the arch.

I am NOT a runner. I am a type 2 diabetic so walking, especially after each meal helps keep the glucose down naturally. My primary goal is and would be just walking, in comfort. Some days I am out all day and some days, just the 20 mins walk around the block after eating. Hoping to get advice from those who are in a similar situation like me.

From my readings, I've read posts mentioning that certain brands/models tend out wear out faster. While that can be a concern for some, in my case, since I'm not running, it would not be a concern. my absolute #1 desire is that I'm able to wear these shoes for many hours, like a day outing without too much discomfort.

While I am conscious of the shoe cost, at this point, I can't put a price on something that will not make my feet hurt after walking all day. I am good with buying a shoe up to US$200. There are some currently on sale at REI, I plan to go there later today. Might even stop by at Dick's sporting goods.

Questions:

1. Do some running shoes fit custom orthotics better than others? If so, can you please recommend some brands/models I should look into? I read on Altra shoes website; their shoes are orthotics friendly.
2. With Orthotics inserted, is it preferred to get the same size shoe as I normally wear, or should I go 1/2 size up or down? This may be a 'it depends' answer but thought to ask.
3. When I get a pair of new shoes, since I'll be inserting my own custom orthotics, do they typically go on top of the shoe insole, or do I remove that THEN insert the orthotics? If that's the case, then what about the forward half of the foot, there won't be any cushion to the foot in that area.

Lastly, a bit on the humorous side, what is up with all the wild, bright color combinations for these running shoes? I think HOKA takes the prize for making their name a billboard on the shoe. :-)

many thanks in advance for your input.",2024-07-06 20:14:43+00:00,3,8

A lot of this advice I haven‚Äôt seen on this thread yet, so hopefully this gives everyone some new ideas for healing!

I am 24 years old and I have been healing well since stress-fracture and inflammation started February 2024 (pain started December 2023). Diagnosed with ‚Äúsick‚Äù / inflamed sesamoid but had fracture symptoms (bone edema, bruising and extreme pain) BUT I recently reinjured myself being on my feet 8 hours, totally overdid it and further splintered the bone, now I‚Äôm in more pain on a regular basis than before going on vacation and struggling not to feel hopeless again and fearful of AVN. I constantly ask myself, When is this injury going to heal, when am I going to be able to enjoy life to the fullest ?! But honesty stress and worry adding cortisol into our bodies is not going to help us heal. 

My doctor told me: ‚Äú A set back is setting you up for a come back‚Äù hopefully this mantra inspires you as it has helped me!

Please add positivity, good advice and success stories on this thread! Let‚Äôs get some positive energy flowing to all with this injury!

- ESWT (my perspective is it‚Äôs worth the money to help promote bone growth)
- Physical Therapy!!!! HUGE
- Keeping walking to 3,000 steps, movement to promote circulation
- circulation focus, stretch your toes and feet often 
- heating pad not ice
- eating strict anti inflammatory diet - HUGE!
- If you start to feel pain, sit down and rest
- Foot bath with Epsom salts
- reflexology and massage therapy! God bless my reflexologist this has been awesome insight!
- sauna and steam rooms
- Peppermint and Copiba essential oils help with circulation and breaking down the gunk in the callus of the bone, I add a few drops with coconut oil and give myself a massage before bed. 
- turmeric and ginger for anti inflammation properties 
- calcium, vitamin D, magnesium supplements (EBM)
- stop smoking weed and drinking
- CBD gel with essential oils for muscle pain
- relaxing and sleeping well, general health will help you heal faster
- weight training and building muscles in your legs and feet, use a PT rubber band to flex your feet
- OOFOS and Hoka shoes, rocker bottom crew!
- ORTHOTICS! Get custom orthotics from a good podiatrist 
- Boot for 1-2 months but not more because you want to maximize circulation not limit it!
- Knee scooter instead of boot!!! Crutches for outside in just shoes for 2nd-3rd months of healing 
- TIME, my mistake was not planning for this to be a 6-8 month process, possibly 1+ years of taking it easy which is super frustrating having plans and wanting to go out dancing with friends but re-injuring is only making this longer.

1dsc2aa,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Mach 6,"Hoka Mach 6

I haven't had a shoe excite me as much as these in a while. I recently put down a variety of workouts totaling around 35-40 miles. Everything from daily training/easy miles, 800m intervals, and one 14 mile long run.

Context: 

I'm 5' 10"", 170 Ibs, 170-180 spm cadence, and midfoot striker. I have a 4:00 marathon, 1:40 HM, 21:30 5K. Not a fast runner by any means but I'm about 1 yr and 2 months into my running journey so l still feel relatively new. I completed my first marathon in April and I'm currently training to run the Philly marathon this year in November.

I've had Rincon 3s and Mach 5s in the past. Those shoes never worked for me however I didn't want to throw Hoka to the wayside. I heard good things about the Mach 6, tried them on in store and made my favorite impulse purchase so far this year.

Positive Thoughts: 

The shoe is rather lightweight and the upper is breathable. I live in Miami, FL so making sure my feet aren't overheating is a huge plus. Out the box you can feel how bouncy the shoe is just by walking in them, it's partially why I left the Hoka store with them and knew what I was in for.

My first run was an easy run and it was a delight. The shoe turns over very easy and it's extremely responsive. It felt very effortless each stride. The shoe isn't on the firm side yet it isn't too soft which is perfect for me. Takes some wear out of your legs no doubt and allows for easier efforts.

Next was a speed workout 6x800m @6:30 pace. I realize this shoe doesn't have a plate, but at this pace they definitely did the job well. I don't think people will find this shoe to be a dedicated speed shoe as there isn't a plate and it lacks some pop, but it can get the job done if you need it to. You feel the shoe bounce right back up off the ground and the shoe feels planted with each stride. Transitions are very seamless as well at these paces.

Last run I did was a 14 mile long run. Honestly effortless. A lot of the same feeling I got with my easy run. Feet didn't overheat or have any sort of tightness/aching whatsoever post run. I wouldn't hesitate to grab for these over my Superblasts currently if you gave me the choice. It's a fun ride from start to end. Even when your legs start to feel a little tired and form begins to compromise I still think the Mach 6 is very forgiving.

Durability wise the rubber on the bottom definitely is a welcome change. I expect this shoe to push 300-400 miles easy and the upper is already rather flexible to your foot. I ran in the wet and dry with these and the performance felt the same, no problems.

Cons: 

What a narrow midfoot. If you thought the Mach 5 was narrow, this shoe doesn't fix that problem and arguably made it worse lol. I'm a 10 in Saucony, Asics, Nike, pretty much every shoe brand. Hoka also has been known to have really inconsistent sizing. TTS it felt like a half size too small and narrow through the midfoot and in the toe box, though the length itself was okay. I went a half size up and it was perfect. Even with the heat and foot swelling I had more than enough room.

Laces also feel like they run short also. So for any reason you need to heel lock you'll definitely need longer laces or lock laces. Might be nitpicking here but trying to get more laces by tightening probably will just put more pressure on your feet since the shoe already runs narrow.

Conclusion: 

Jack of all trades shoe but master of none. However this is not inherently a bad thing whatsoever. This shoe can really do it all for you at almost every single pace, and for most that's all you need. I'll continue to use these for my training/easy runs and long runs as I continue to base build leading up into my next block. I'll occasionally use these for speed work however I have Endorphin Speed 4s and Boston 12s in my rotation so those can fill the void for me. 

All in all if you need one shoe to do everything, this shoe is worth the price currently for me and I'll definitely pick up another pair in the future.",2024-06-30 21:27:54+00:00,87,39

I have noticed the frequency of hurt feet is increasing with my trail runs. I run in the Ozarks, and the terrain is very rocky, technical. No groomed trails. My current shoes are Saucony Peregrine 14, which I really enjoy.

As I live on the Midwest Coast, we don‚Äôt get the largest selection of gear. My shoes do have a rock plate but perhaps shoes exist with more substantial plates? 

Recovery shoes, to combat this on multiple fronts I tried the oofos and hokas. I did not purchase as they did not give me that ahhh.

1dq4jnf,FootFunction,POP goes the tendon?,"I was just picking my way through a mud puddle and trying to stay to the edges and my weight came down on my right foot (I'm wearing Hoka's) and there was a POP.  I immediately stilled because it was the ""that can't be anything good"" kind of pop.

So I took the next step and yep, the heel to toe walking flex is not happening.  Stairs are like a 3 yo:  one at a time, having a hard time trying not to push up with the right foot, and find a way to navigate with keeping the foot as immobile as possible (i.e. flat).

I iced and took Ibuprofen.  Walking is me trying to find ways to not flex the foot.  The pop occurred at the end of the 5th metatarsal, near the outside of the middle of the foot, kind of where the Peroneus Tertiary Tendon is.  I'm using big words, not because I really know what they mean, but more because on the diagram from Google, that is where the pop occurred.  

It happened when I was transitioning weight from heel to toe.  I'm 5'9"" and 300 lbs and I have flat feet or fallen arches or something like that (I've never been diagnosed, I'm just used to my feet hurting).  I did have plantar fasciitis, tried the boot without luck, but WOW did the tennis ball do the trick.  Hurt so good.  I do get regular foot massages because my achilles tendon was hurting.

1dofqi7,BeginnersRunning,Shin Splints and Bad Endurance,"Hello all, I am a 23-year-old 6'4 210lb guy who has never ran in my life. I am rather physically fit, been in the gym for 4 years, been in bodybuilding competitions. All that said I think the last time I ran was a mile in 8th grade on the PT test.

I am planning on joining the military and want to get a jump on the cardio aspect, need to be able to run at least 2 miles but want to be able to comfortably run 3-5. Been trying for maybe 3 weeks. I can literally only run probably .75 miles without wheezing for breath and having pretty bad upper back pain when taking a deep breath. I understand a common reason for back pain is bad form and tight hips but all the articles i've read seem to be pointing towards lower back pain, this is specifically upper/mid back pain like a tightness when breathing, I feel almost no lower back pain.

I've been trying to run every other day. I actually ran a full mile in 10:21 about a week ago with a brief pause for air in the middle of it. I've looking into breathing techniques, and they helped a little bit but it still only got me maybe .2 miles further than normal. Is it normal to be this out of breath when initially starting?

And shin splints. Holy shit are they horrible. Like I said I run almost every other day and try to get at least a mile, but the next 2-3 days following I have terrible shin splints. I've just recently began doing calf stretches and hip stretches. I've iced it before but that seemed to make them feel stiffer (maybe thats the point not really sure).

I guess what I'm asking is it normal to experience these symptoms and if so when/will it get better? What specific workouts can I do the make my muscles stronger and more functional for running? I'm more concerned about the shin splints and back pain than I am with my endurance because from experience with the gym I know that will improve overtime.

Also I do have running shoes, I believe they are the Hoka Clifton One's. When I purchased them and used them the first maybe 5 times I felt no pain.

1do1hkr,RunningShoeGeeks,HOKA Kawana2 Review,"I've walked 6 km wearing it today and this might be one of the worst shoes that you can imagine when walking or running on roads.

I wanted to buy Clifton9 or Bondi 8 as they seemed to be most renowned and there were many positive reviews about them, but sizing Clifton 9 for me was really tricky while Bondi 8 initially felt kinda weird with  its high stack height and maximized plush cushion. 

Kawana 2, despite the fact that It was made to be neutral,balanced, and versatile, gave me exceptional stiffness, especially in the midsole. However, this shoe is generally bigger and longer compared to the same size of running shoes from other brands.
I think a lack of flexibility and 5mm low heel to toe drop combined together can cause ankle pain and foot problems. When walking or running, you can't go faster and have a little bit of fun because It almost feels like It is limiting and blocking the speed. 
The only pros I think is that It might relieve the pressure on your hips.

1dnxpc5,hiking,Stinson 7 vs Speedgoat 5,"Hello, I need some advice regarding the comparison between stinson 7s and speedgoat 5s. I am going on a trip to Colorado soon, and I am looking to buy a pair of shoes. Our trip consists of a lot of hiking and potential running, but mainly staying on the trails. To estimate, we will probably be hiking around 100-200 miles.

I went to REI to try on Hokas twice now. The first time, I really liked the Speedgoats and the second time around I felt my feet weren't as supported. The stinsons are comfortable, but I am worried about the foam deflating. I also usually wear Sambas daily so the heavy foam is hard to get used to. I have also heard some people say stinsons are very heavy and not worth it. I currently have a 4 year old pair of Nike Air Max 270 shoes that are making my feet scream. My favorite shoe ever were the Adidas NMD R1 (or might have been a similar style). I ran in those shoes so much that the bottom of the shoe had no texture lol

Based on the trip and my current shoes, what shoe would be recommended? Or maybe there is a different brand I should try out?",2024-06-25 04:42:53+00:00,1,6
1dni8r6,trailrunning,Swim run cross shoe advice needed,"Hi. I‚Äôve signed up for my first swim run this year (after years of triathlon, including one X-Tri) and I‚Äôm looking for some shoe recommendations. Figured I‚Äôd ask here, since I expect that the crowd here has more experience with similar trail conditions.

Have read a bunch of posts on the best swim run shoes already and I still have my 2018 New Balance Summit Unknown (2E Wide) with 800k on them, but those have zero bounces left to give. I really liked running in them a lot though (despite not liking the RG1400v6 very much, which felt flat from the start). I like how light they are, I like the lug pattern, which seems grippy even in mud (whereas I slip around more on my Saucony Peregrine 13, which run great but also feel heavier and have a narrow toe box), and the Summit Unknowns have always seemed to drain water well whenever I was running in the rain or snow. I generally run on 5 +/- 1 mm drop nowadays and like firm, responsive shoes for racing (I really like my Kinvara 12 for example) .¬†

So I‚Äôm looking for something equivalent or a successor (FuelCell ?) that fits my preferences, doesn‚Äôt break the bank, and could be used for swim run and technical trails. So far I‚Äôve seen a lot of mentions of Altra Lone Peak, Hoka Speedgoat, Inov-8 Trailfly, Salomon Speedcross, Topo something (had never heard of these), but I don‚Äôt know enough about these other brands to understand what would best fit all of my preferences (light, traction, responsive, and, importantly, drains water well), and what their durability is (I was not impressed with my Hoka Mach 4 outsole for example, but read that the Speedgoat has a Vibram outsole).¬†

Any tips for preventing blisters would be great too. I always run with regular running socks and only get blisters between my big and index toe on my longer runs (which is 20k for me and, I imagine, the equivalent of a warm up for long distance runners).¬†

1dnfaft,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Mach 6 (initial impression after two runs),"Hi, 

I was after another light weight daily trainer to replace my Asics Novablast 3 as they lost their responsiveness, after around 100km - very disappointing. I still have the Novablast 1 and still going strong after 170km. 

I narrowed my options down to the NB rebel v4, Adidas Sl2 and Hoka Mach 6. I read the Hoka was more stable than the adidas and probably better for longer runs. I tried the NB Rebel v4 in the store compared to the Hoka. The rebel v4 felt baggy on the upper and I sank to much into the heel. The Hoka felt narrow but very comfortable.

The Hoka was on sale from $259 to $179 (AUS) so bought them. So far two runs in them.

**First run - 5km.** 

I thought I push them a little and wow did they fly. The first km was at 4.36 min/km, I don't normally run that fast only in the Saucony Pro 3's. Felt they picked up the pace quicker than my speed 3's. I slowed down as getting puffed and did the 5km in 24.33, average pace 4.54 per km . I normally run  a 5 km in my Asics Novablast around 5.15-20 pace, Saucony triumph 20s, 5.10, even my speed 3's around 5 min pace. For an unplated shoe they feel fast. 

**Second run - 8.5km.**

Run on a grass oval at 5.45 pace , and they felt nice on soft ground at those paces.  Fairly stable too, no slipping. 

Overall - Very smooth ride, quick heel to toe transition, gets you on your toes quickly. Quite versatile from tempo efforts down to slower paces.

**Summary:** 

**Upper:** 

The upper is very comfortable, a little bit of padding on the tongue, no lace bite. I would say its quite breathable but its winter here, probably on a hot summers day it probably would get a bit warm. The upper is quite narrow, a bit like a race fit but comfortable, toe box on the slightly narrow side. Okay from average to narrow feet, there is a wide version too. 8/10

**Midsole:**

They feel well cushioned (I measured 37 at the heel and 32 forefoot). Fairly soft but not as soft as the rebel v3/4 or Novablast 3, feel  softer than the Saucony Triumph 20. They have a nice early stage rocker and get you on your toes pretty quickly and there is a nice pop off toe off due to the stiff forefoot - it reminded me of a plate but gentler and not as stiff. Nice bounce too. Fairly stable as I tend to heel to midfoot strike, was fine on grass, no slipping - so grip fine.   8.75/10

I am use to more a 8-10mm drop, this  is 5mm, seem fine due to the rocker, but I did put a small heel insert that helped as well.  

**Overall:** 

I think this is one of the most enjoyable non plated shoes I have run in. Nice bouncy, quick transitions, easy to pickup the pace and hold the pace. They were close to true to size - maybe a touch short, I wear size 10.5/11, and got size 11. Weigh around 250g, left and right shoe were within 4g.

Its a close call between my Saucony speed 3's and Mach 6, maybe the speed has a little more protection for long runs and maybe a little more efficient - due to the plate and speedroll technology, but the Mach 6 feels lighter on foot and maybe even more enjoyable, .  Overall very versatile, but not a recovery day shoe.

I would be happy to use the Mach 6 for a faster daily trainer, tempo shoe, a 5 or 10km race or a training shoe. For the sale price I give them 9 out of 10 overall.",2024-06-24 14:48:32+00:00,30,12

1dn1bj8,FootFunction,Midfoot Arthiritis caught up with me again,"**Summary:** I'm a 31-year-old male dealing with a frustrating midfoot arthritis flare-up and looking for advice on how to manage it better and prevent future episodes. I have a history of osteophytes and sesamoiditis, and I‚Äôve recently become active in triathlon training. Any insights on running, footwear, and potential solutions (surgical or non invasive) would be greatly appreciated!

**Background:** Hi everyone, I‚Äôm a 32-year-old guy who‚Äôs always been pretty active. I was into sports in my teens, but after college, I gained quite a bit of weight. During COVID, I took the opportunity to get back in shape, which is when I started noticing some foot issues.

I've had a bump on the top of my midfoot for about 10 years. It was originally misdiagnosed as a ganglion cyst, which didn't bother me much until about four years ago. After a bad flare-up, an X-ray, MRI, and a visit to an orthopedic surgeon revealed that I have osteophytes between my medial and intermediate cuneiform bones, with some degeneration in the dorsal part of the joint. Around the same time, I also dealt with sesamoiditis (my sesamoid bone is bipartite), which was initially more troublesome than the midfoot issue. A cortisone injection helped with that.

**Rehabilitation Journey:** It took me about two years to get back to normal activity levels. I was on and off crutches every 3-6 months due to flare-ups. Over the past year, I‚Äôve been working with a chiropractor, a physio, and a PT who is familiar with barefoot training. I managed to train and complete two sprint triathlons without major foot issues, which made me really happy!

**Current Footwear and Routine:** I got myself a pair of Hoka Bondi running shoes with extra cushioning for exercise, but I usually wear VivoBarefoot shoes for daily activities. I also ball roll daily, do yoga, and weight train (although less so in the summer). My PT recommended exercises like individual toe control, ball under toes, and towel pulls, but I haven‚Äôt been following them religiously recently since my foot wasn‚Äôt bothering me much. For the last year at least, I have been exercising 5 times / week.

**Recent Flare-Up:** This year, I decided to aim for an Olympic triathlon (1.5km swim, 40km bike, 10km run). Training was going well until about six weeks ago when I pulled my calf running on a track. I training mileage did increase over the last  6 months, too prepare for the longer tri. My midfoot was fine until I had a minor incident while traveling for work. After returning home, I noticed a dull pain in my midfoot after a 15 km cycle, which wasn‚Äôt too bad, but the next morning, I woke up with severe pain and couldn‚Äôt walk. I ended up on crutches for a week, then transitioned to a boot.

**Current Status:** It‚Äôs been three weeks now, and the boot has been helping to immobilize the joint and let the arthritis heal. Normally, I try to ‚Äúwalk off‚Äù other injuries, but this one just gets aggravated with any movement. The delay in symptoms is tricky; it might feel good one day, then worse the next after some walking. This flare-up really caught me by surprise.

**Questions:**

1. **Running and Arthritis:** If I continue running, will my midfoot arthritis just keep getting worse?
2. **Triathlon Participation:** Triathlons have kept me in good shape. Should I avoid running to prevent further issues?
3. **Footwear Concerns:** Will wearing my VivoBarefoot shoes, which have no cushioning, contribute to arthritis degeneration?
4. **Surgical Options:** Should I reconsider surgical options like fusion or shaving the osteophyte?
5. **Podologist** Would seeing a podologist be beneficial?
6. **Prevention Strategies:** Any tips on limiting the chance of this happening again, even if a 100% solution isn‚Äôt possible? Is the articular health method mentioned in this sub an option for me ?

**Additional Information:**

* **Activity Goals:** My short-term goal is to walk normally again. Long-term, I‚Äôd love to get back to triathlons.
* **Current Management:** Following R.I.C.E., using crutches and a boot, and consulting with a chiropractor, physio, and PT familiar with barefoot training.

Thanks for reading my story. I appreciate any advice or experiences you can share on managing midfoot arthritis while staying active",2024-06-24 01:07:06+00:00,3,5

**About Me:**¬†Hobby jogger that puts up \~40-50 miles (64-80 km) a week. Not a bigger runner - 5'9"", 158lbs (175 cm, 72kg) and have been a minimalist/barefoot runner for the past decade, until early 2024.

**The Fit:**¬†I have quite narrow and high-arched feet; I typically run in Women's shoes because of this. However, these fit pretty decent in the US 8.5 Men's that I purchased. My right foot has less volume in the mid-foot area than my left and I did struggle to get proper lockdown at times; this was simply solved by tightening the laces on my right foot beyond what I usually would.

**How I Used These Shoes:**¬†I purchased these to use as a daily trainer that would allow me to transition back into 'traditional' running shoes. Prior to running in these (in 2024) I attempted to transition back into 'traditional' shoes with Altra shoes, which gave me a pretty extreme peroneal tendonitis flare up.

**The Ride:**¬†These shoes produce a very prescriptive ride. By that I mean that there is little to no ground feel and it's more like you are running on top of a slab of firm midsole that tends to not soften up at all; even after many 2+ hour long runs. I found the foam to be so firm that the shoe doesn't really ever feel like a cohesive extension of your foot and biomechanics; it never just 'melts away' and lets you forget that you're wearing a shoe so that you can just run. That having been said, the light weight and aggressive rocker profile of the Rincon make turnover feel effortless during the stride; it was the best part of the ride.

**The Issue:**¬†The biggest issues with the Rincon 3 that I had were durability and outsole grip. As I noted earlier, the midsole is quite firm and does not soften up with further use. At 100 miles the shoe feels like an absolute brick to use for running (or walking). Additionally, the durability of the outsole and wet-weather grip are atrocious. I live somewhere that is rainy/cloudy for 8+ months of the ear and the shoe was borderline unusable in wet conditions; it felt as if I was running on an ice rink in¬†*mild*¬†rain. Even on completely sunny days, if a small trace of water was left from someone's sprinkler system the shoe would slip during toe-off on asphalt or sidewalk. The lugs on the outsole wore completely down in some areas at 100.1 miles (according to Strava).

Overall, this is an okay shoe - but the ride is boring and uninspired; I struggled to get the shoe to 100 miles because of this. The durability of the midsole and outsole were a major downfall of the shoe.",2024-06-23 20:16:19+00:00,20,6

Overall thoughts up top: an awesome shoe that I love a lot, but costs way too much.

[The Hypers after a rainy run](https://preview.redd.it/58m3zse2e48d1.png?width=2975&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f8d6b5883846d35de0e83af04195b851b877a6)

About me:  
Recent shoe history: Trainers: Mach 5, Cloudmonster 1, Noosa Tri 14, Boston 12, Streakfly, Endorphin Speed 4; Racers: Vaporfly 2, Rocket x2, Endorphin Elite, Alphafly 3  
190cm (6‚Äô3), 105kg (230lb)  
5k 19:02, 10k 39:20, HM 1:30

I‚Äôll outline a few important things (specs, value and use case) at the top, then go into more depth before providing some longer form thoughts on how it compares to other ""super trainers"" (using that definition liberally).

As I said at the outset, I really love this shoe. I‚Äôm sure part of that comes from me being a heavier runner, and from being a midfoot/heel striker particularly at slower paces. I have desperately wanted a pair of ASICS Superblasts but they don‚Äôt make them in a US14 so this was my replacement . There are shared characteristics between those shoes but some significant differences (I get into this at the bottom of the review).

**Quick specs**

38mm stack, 6mm drop, 265g (9.3 oz) for US men‚Äôs 9. The shoe has a layer of Helion (On‚Äôs PEBA superfoam - their version or ZoomX, Lightstrike Pro, FF Turbo/+ etc) in the forefoot above a layer of Cloudtec - their standard EVA (a lot like the Superblast!). This setup runs about halfway through the shoe and the back 40-50% is just Cloudtec.

**Value**

Not great. At $320 AUD (note: all dollar values in this review will be in AUD), you expect more - for just $20 more you can get a top tier plated marathoner like the Endorphin Pro 4. The upper and laces are absolutely premium but I expect more superfoam at this price point (eg the Superblast has full-length FF Turbo over a very thin FF Blast layer). My thoughts on the value are set out in greater detail at the bottom of this review.

**What (I think) this shoe is for**

This is the perfect shoe for everything slower than (and possibly including) marathon pace. The perfect use case in my opinion is easy/steady long runs. I am so happy chugging along at easy paces pretty much endlessly in this shoe. I have taken the shoe up to marathon pace, and while it does ok, it doesn‚Äôt quite have the quick turnover (compared to eg an Endorphin Speed 4). I think it fits perfectly as a super comfortable mile muncher that you can do all your not-fast running in while still getting a nice bit of pop out of the forefoot slab of Helion.

While I am a full embracer of the super trainer revolution, I don‚Äôt like the idea of doing most training in plated shoes, so I love that I still get a bit of pop and bounce on all my easy runs in a non-plated shoe (compared to eg Boston 12, Hoka Skyward X, Mizuno Neo Vista etc).

**Upper & Lacing**

Literally perfect. Super comfortable, super premium. Wide toebox (without being roomy or baggy), good materials, awesome laces. Every time I put these shoes on my feet I am happy.

**Outsole**

Pretty good! Have run in two thunderstorms in these and even in pouring rain I‚Äôve had zero issues. Wouldn‚Äôt wear them offroad (maybe on fire trail/crushed gravel) but that‚Äôs more of a high stack issue than a grip issue.

**Midsole/ride**

It‚Äôs worth acknowledging: most runners are about 50-70% of my weight, and my experience with this midsole is certainly a product (to at least some extent) of the weight I‚Äôm putting through it. That said, I do really like it. It‚Äôs on the firmer side, but the forefoot feels spongy and squishy (in a good way!). You still get good energy return as you toe off, but in a more ‚Äúslow release‚Äù kind of way, rather than the instant pop you get from super racing shoes, or even from super trainers like the ES4 and (so I‚Äôve heard) the Superblast. They also are (and feel) quite light for how comfortable the upper is and how much foam is on them.

Overall: firmer but still comfortable, solid energy return. I really wish they had more of the Helion superfoam - maybe in an arrangement like the Boston 12 where it‚Äôs a tapered wedge so that the heel is mostly EVA but you still get the superfoam throughout the whole shoe. I think that would make it a lot more versatile (again, like the Superblast!!) whereas as it‚Äôs currently set up, I think it‚Äôs best suited to exclusively slower miles.

**Stability**

For a close-to-max stack shoe, I had no issues. I always feel super confident in it, even in wet weather. That said, it's not a ""stability shoe"" per se.

**Fit**

Seemed true to size for me. I'm a US14 in pretty much everything reliably and the fit in these is great.

**Looks**

Like all On shoes, these seem to be polarising aesthetically, personally I absolutely love them. Mostly white with a splash of colour is a good recipe.

**Long form thoughts**

*Comparisons*

The obvious comparison is the Superblast: it‚Äôs a very similar setup, but with the ‚ÄúPEBA on top of a thin layer of EVA‚Äù through the whole¬†shoe not just the front half or so. Despite having way more superfoam, it's the same price ($320). The generous read to On is this: not every foam is as firm and durable as FF Turbo, and having a full shoe of mostly Helion (undoubtedly softer than FF Turbo) with no stiffening agent like a plate or speedboard would be super unstable and lack any durability. This may be true (and in part makes me intrigued as to whether the Superblast 2 will be as successful with the softer FF Turbo+ in the midsole), but I think On could have put a lot more Helion in the shoe without compromising its stability or durability, meaning that this is probably just On cheaping out on the nice foam? Which really sucks when we're paying $320! It is worth noting that a common Superblast complaint is the cheap feeling upper (which is the Hyper's greatest strength), but why can't we just have the Hyper upper on a better midsole. Annoying.

The shoe that really exposes the bad value of the Hyper is the Endorphin Speed 4. It does the easy stuff almost as well as the Hyper, does the fast stuff wayyy better (I would happily race in the ES4) and costs $30 less despite being 100% superfoam (PWRRUN PB) and having a nylon plate. It still has a premium feeling upper despite being 30g/1oz lighter and is just overall a better shoe in every single way (except looks). It‚Äôs inexcusable that the Hyper costs $30 more. That said, the ES4 is maybe my favourite shoe of all time, so it‚Äôs a lofty standard to compare it to.

Finally, many may disagree but I actually think the Boston 12 is the best comparison for the Hyper (in terms of use case,  not ride/feel). I never liked the Boston as a tempo shoe, for me it worked best as a comfy mile muncher with some ability to pick up the pace. It also has layers of PEBA and EVA, although it has energy rods (Adidas‚Äô plate equivalent). The Hyper definitely has a **much** nicer upper and a more comfortable ride whereas the Boston is more nimble. And: the Boston costs $80 less at $240! Again emphasising the unreasonableness of the Hyper‚Äôs price tag. Another slightly random comparison is the recently released Adidas Adizero SL2. Almost as high stack (36mm), a big chunk of superfoam (Lightstrike Pro), no plate/rods, and oh, it‚Äôs $140 less (retailing for $180 AUD)! I‚Äôm sure the upper is worse than the Hyper, but it‚Äôs a not dissimilar midsole for 56% of the price. That‚Äôs just ridiculous.

*Plates/rods*

As someone who is too big for the Superblast (though crossing my fingers that the Superblast 2 goes up to a 14), this shoe fills an important niche for me: plate-less super trainer. As much as I love the Endorphin Speed 4 (and the Boston 12 before it), I think there is a lot of merit in doing at least some (if not most) of your training in unplated shoes. This topic has been discussed ad nauseam but I think it's well accepted at this point that you lose some benefits from doing all your runs in carbons. I'll happily chuck on ES4s or carbon plated race shoes for a workout or even a long run with marathon pace efforts, but for everything else I want no plate. That said, I want to experience the joys of running on modern superfoams for all my runs - they're bouncy and fun and keep your legs fresh, why deprive yourself of that!

As an example, I recently got another pair of Mach 5s (previously one of my favourite shoes ever), and it just feels so much worse than I remembered - I think because I've been spoiled by shoes like the ES4, Boston 12 and the Hyper. Going forward, I have minimal interest in going back to basic EVA, but don't want to do all my running in plated shoes, which is what a lot of super trainers are - Mizuno Neo Vista, NB SC Trainer, Boston, Endorphin Speed, Prime X, Skyward X, Cielo X1, Puma DN2/3 etc.

There's therefore a niche that I'm extremely invested in, which is the high stack shoe that uses superfoams extensively but doesn't use a plate or rods - so far this is pretty much solely the Superblast (limited sizing), the Hyper, and maybe (early impressions seem good!) the Triumph 22 and Adizero SL2 (though does 36mm put you into super trainer territory?). You could maybe also chuck a shoe like the Rebel v4 (PEBA blend) or possibly even shoes with supercritical EVA like the Mach 6 or Skyflow into this category. As someone who would like to do 60% or more of my mileage in a shoe that fits into this category, the simple fact that the Hyper fits the criteria makes it a shoe that I am really loving. I just wish it was $50 cheaper, or had 30% more Helion.

**Conclusion**

If you want a taste of the super trainer experience without a plate, you'll enjoy this shoe. If you liked the Cloudmonster 1, you will enjoy this shoe. If you're a chunky boy like me, you'll probably enjoy this shoe! Just don't expect it to be a Superblast.",2024-06-22 12:40:28+00:00,26,28

I'm looking for a light trail shoe that isn't horrible on pavement. I only see myself running up to 10k distances on trails. The trails near me are loose over hard pack and sandy with lots of small roots. I'm used to using flatter (0mm to 4mm) drop shoes with less padding for my daily wear and gym shoes as well as for hiking (I wear my Merrell trail gloves for hiking). I'm looking for something with a little added padding for my trail runs and not too of aggressive lugs. The high stack height look of hokas always turns me off, however I see shoes like the challengers get recommended frequently. I would prefer something around a 20mm stack with a minimal drop and a rounded toe box. I recently tried the topo runventures and liked the feel, however the size was too big and now they seem to be discontinued and out of my correct size. I would love the Merrell trail glove but with 15-20mm of foam. Any suggestions? ",2024-06-21 12:56:03+00:00,0,4

1djohc9,AskDocs,Right outer calcaneal pain persisting for several months,"I'm 41, assigned-male at birth, 6'4"", 330lbs, non-binary person (they/he pronouns). History of asthma as a child, UPPP surgery to address sleep apnea, and minor fractions of left elbow, both wrists, and left thumb at various points growing up due to acute traumatic accidents. History of acetabular impingement per an orthopedic specialist. History of possible left meniscus tear -- MR negative but pain consistent with either that or ""patellar loading syndrome"", but pain persisted despite weight loss.

Prior to pain in right foot, I was having bilateral I-T band stiffness/soreness/pain that persisted \~2 years. I still have some stiffness/soreness but have begun a new warmup routine that heavily addresses tensor fascia latae and gluteus medius stiffness that is primary cause of I-T band pain under supervision of physical therapy and an exercise & wellness specialist. This has helped the I-T band improve a lot from \~8/10 pain to \~3/10 on bad days and perhaps 1-0/10 on the best days.

I have had a history of transient plantar fasciitis, most notably in my left foot in the past. This was brought on by running which is disappointing because I originally lost around 100 pounds by vigorous exercise, much of which was running. I was diagnosed with bilateral hallux limitus/rigidus several years back and while that condition has not worsened, it does limit the range of motion I have in my big toes.

I'm wondering if some of the pain in my right foot is because the toe restriction is changing my gait resulting in inappropriate recruitment of either the plantar fascia or the achille's and thus inflammation and thus pain.

I have done a lot of foot massage both rolling it on lacrosse balls/tennis balls to massage the whole plantar region as well as with more pin-point massage tools to get deep into areas with lots of adhesions. I have felt the stereotypical ""bubble wrap pop"" feeling as I roll out the plantar area, but I've rolled until I no longer get those adhesion pops. Indeed, the bottom of my right foot feels great. It's the OUTER surface of my heel that is extremely painful.

Specifically, I've noticed that if I participate in high-intensity interval classes at my local YMCA, it seems to get tweaked to the point that I'm limping the next day, even with a pain killer.

I have an appointment to see a podiatrist, but the soonest they could get me in is late July though I'm on cancellation list (fingers crossed!). I think a cortisone injection in the region that is hurting would maybe help everything chill out and reset to baseline at which point vigorous exercise might not bring this on again.

I'm wearing Hoka Arahi 7's specifically because my arches tend to collapse inward and the Arahi 7 has a built in rail for supporting the foot so it cannot roll in. I find that my foot is much less painful in that shoe than in crocs, slippers, or barefoot in the house.

Can plantar fasciitis present as pain on the posterior-lateral aspect of the calcaneus? I always thought it was more of an instep/arch/ball of the foot condition. Could this be achille's tendonopathy instead?

The pain seems to be the worst first thing in the morning when I get out of bed and at night when I head upstairs to bed. It is worse going down stairs than going up. I have an old house that has wood trim in the doorways that arches up from the floor to cover the gap in flooring between rooms, and I've noticed that standing on that offers a good bit of relief because of how my foot drapes over it slightly, but it's very temporary, and as soon as I stop the foot hurts again.

It almost feels like a bruise, the kind of wincing/withdrawing sharp pain that makes you not want to use the body part in question. Only problem is, this is my foot and I have to walk to do my job and such. It's pain that I can push through and have been, but it's also quite bad pain that I'd really rather NOT push through.

If any foot specialists could weigh in with their experience with plantar fasciitis and achille's tendonopathy and any way I could try to determine which this is (or if it's something else) that would be most excellent. It doesn't seem to respond further to massage, but it's a very awkward area to massage as it's right on the round off on the side of my heel so it's very difficult to get pressure applied there without my foot or the massage tool slipping off.",2024-06-19 17:13:11+00:00,2,1
1dipv6e,PlantarFasciitis,Scraping Saved Me ,"I recently moved to NYC and have been walking a ton. A few months ago, I started experiencing pain in my heels and thought it was a problem with my shoes, but even after wearing Hokas all day I would wake up the next morning barely able to walk for the first few minutes. I finally realized it was ridiculous to be putting up with this and that I could potentially be causing more damage if I didn‚Äôt look into it. 

I‚Äôm assuming that I have PF based on what I found online but I guess take this with a grain of salt since it‚Äôs a self diagnosis. I learned about scraping the bottoms of your feet and calves to help break up scar tissue and increase blood flow and promote collagen production. I have been scraping my feet with the back of a butter knife (not paying $100 for a scraping tool rn) twice a day, and noticed a difference in pain levels pretty much immediately. I‚Äôve only been scraping for 3 days now, but this morning I woke up and could walk with practically no pain!!!

THE BEGINNING: PAIN & PODIATRIST #1 

8 months ago in October I wore the wrong rain boots one day and started feeling pain in my foot. 

I was training for a half marathon at the time, thought nothing of the pain, and took pain killers to get through my runs (TERRIBLE idea). 

In November I go get x-rayed and the podiatrist misdiagnoses the problem as bunions. I do have slight bunions but they weren‚Äôt the reason my feet were in pain. 

X ray shows nothing. No fractures, nothing (see comments for photo). I switch to wide toed shoes thinking it‚Äôll solve my bunion issue. 

JANUARY: NEW DIAGNOSIS, PODIATRIST #2 
Fast forward to January. Pain is still bad, I‚Äôve pretty much cut out running. 

I go to a new podiatrist in January who diagnose me as sesamoiditis. Great. I get recommended for dancer pads to see if those will help. 

I wear them for ~3 weeks. I think they helped but my shoes were giving bad support. 

I change to hokas bondis. 

I‚Äôm running like ~1-2 per month, low mileage (1 mile ish). During the runs I would feel fine, the day after I would feel flare up. Still walking in pain lowkey 

APRIL: BREAKTHROUGH? 

I get padded insoles from my podiatrist (not CUSTOM ones, just padded ones where the podiatrist adds padding to the bottom of my hokas soles to isolate and off load sesamoid area). 

IMMEDIATELY I feel less pain. I was so happy. Breakthrough moment fr 

My podiatrist tells me to go on a short run to see what it‚Äôs like. I go run. GODDAMN back to square one, I‚Äôm in pain walking even in the padded soles. 

JUNE: MRI‚Ä¶ but nothing 

So with the new pain I finally get scheduled for an MRI 8months since the beginning onset of pain. I get it on my right foot bc that one hurts more than the left one. 

At this point my pain is subsiding again and I can walk in the padded insoles 

BUT MY MRI COMES BACK COMPLETELY CLEAN. 

Technique: multiplanar MR imaging of foot without contrast 
Findings: 
Bone: no fractures. No abnormal marrow signal. Normal sesamoids. 
Soft tissues: no fluid collection 
Muscles: no muscular edema
Tendons:  no abnormality 
Impression: normal mri of forefoot 

So mri doesn‚Äôt even show sesamoiditis, I can walk pain free on padded insoles but still can‚Äôt walk barefoot/run. WHAT DO I DO FROM HERE? ANY ADVICE WOULD BE APPRECIATED.

1di4xk0,sesamoid,My Sesamoid Story,"43 Year old Male, active in the gym.  Mostly lift weights and do incline walking or cycling for cardio. Early February I got on the treadmill for my 30 minute incline walk after some weightlifting.  A minute in and I felt pain in left foot, tried to push through to no avail. Figured it would just solve itself and noticed it getting worse over the next few days.  Went to a City MD (live in Manhattan, terrible place to have a foot problem) and got x-rays which showed ‚Äúa small and healing stress fracture in 2nd metatarsal.  Got the boot and was told to stay in 4-6 weeks.  6 weeks later still pain with weight bearing.  Went to Mt. Sinai Orthopedic.  2nd x-ray showed same stress fracture and further healing, but if I‚Äôm still in pain stay in the boot.  8 weeks in and same pain with weight bearing. And, now, my knee is bothering me badly in the same leg.  I‚Äôd had so much muscle atrophy and bad gait for 8 weeks I now have patellar tendonitis & potential meniscus tear. Same DR suggests coming out of boot but going to a rigid post op shoe, which I did. Oh, and do PT for my knee‚Ä¶ I was also using a knee scooter or crutches around apartment to minimize weight bearing during this time.  11 weeks in and I decided to go to One Medical Dr (Ortho Specialist) for another opinion, nothing is really getting better.  He first said drop the crutches and I need to start building muscle back in leg as that was making things worse.  To speed up, my knee is 80% better and muscle is coming back after last 6 weeks of PT.  He suggested podiatrist for the foot.  Podiatrist did 3rd x-ray and she x-rayed both feet so she could compare.  She was quickly concerned with sesamoid bones in left foot.  Ordered MRI, showed me how to pad/off-load sesamoids bones and said stay in Hoka‚Äôs.  

MRI Diagnosis: Patchy bone marrow edema throughout the tibial & fibular sesamoids, compatible with nonspecific Sesamoiditis, without visible fracture or evidence of AVN. 

Went back to podiatrist last week to review MRI results and she decided since I‚Äôve done the boot and 80% off-loading for so long, she felt steroid injection would be next step followed by custom orthotics & PRP if I‚Äôm not progressing.  Have an appointment this week and my foot has been worse since injection and now my right foot is starting to hurt with similar pain in same area.  WTF, I wouldn‚Äôt wish this on my worst enemy.  Quality of life is going down, and if it lingers for another 3 months, work will be in jeopardy.  Bullet pointing below what I‚Äôm currently doing, happy to hear others thoughts and or what‚Äôs worked for them. I should mention I have great movement/flexibility with toes and no pain in doing so.  It‚Äôs only weight bearing pain‚Ä¶

- Wearing Hoka‚Äôs with off-loaded padding
- Wear slippers in apartment so not walking on hardwoods
- Staying off feet AMAP, I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm operating at about 20% of my normal steps pre-injury
- Take cars instead of train in city (that‚Äôs getting expensive) 
- Ice at least 3 times a day 
- Just started contrast ice baths yesterday but plan to do every night
- Ordered custom UpStep orthotics and have messaged them about sesamoid relief (which they say they‚Äôre familiar with)

Anyways, trying to keep my head up and stay positive but it‚Äôs hard AF.  I have really bad days mentally & emotionally and I‚Äôm sure this is all wearing on my family as well.  It‚Äôs just a terrible injury with a terrible quality of life along the way.  I understand I‚Äôm still blessed and there are people with worse conditions, but thought I‚Äôd share with folks in the same boat.  Thanks for reading and any thoughts/support are appreciated.

Update: 6/20/24

Saw podiatrist today.  Asked her about Exogen Bone Stimulator.  She suggested against it as I do not have clear signs of a ‚Äúfracture‚Äù. Therefore, she didn‚Äôt see the purpose‚Ä¶ I was fitted for custom orthotics to ensure proper off-loading during activities (as opposed to my makeshift versions), and she highly suggests PRP.  I made an appointment and believe I‚Äôll move forward.  It‚Äôs $1,500 (not covered), but apparently there‚Äôs only upside and she says she has had nothing but positive outcomes.  Said it‚Äôs supposed to take a few months to fully benefit but she has patients with pain down to 0-1 after a few weeks.  I reckon outside of the costs, why not?!",2024-06-17 18:17:37+00:00,10,31

I have big feet (US 13) and can sometimes have a hard time finding shoes even though I have a medium Arch, am a mid-foot striker, and do not over or underpronate. 

I do have a pretty wide toe splay however. I have tried speedgoats on in the past and they were just always uncomfortable.

The other day I decided to go for it and try some wides on. Didn't really occur to me ever to try them because the rest of my foot isn't particularly wide and the few times I've tried wides on in other brands they felt really sloppy. The wide speedgoats were perfect! Did my first run in them today and I 100% get the hype! Excited to be able to add these to my my rotation.

1dgitzv,RunningShoeGeeks,"Hoka Speedgoat 6 - Slow, Wide Footed First Impressions","*This is not a deep-dive into the shoe over a long run or even a medium run. I‚Äôm a slow runner coming back from an injury. I took this on ~2 mile run that consisted of running and hiking*

**fit**

For months I‚Äôve been trying to find an adequate trail shoe that fits me wide in the midfoot and medium/wide in the forefoot. Altra and Topo are the common recommendations here but I find that most of their offerings have good toe boxes but horribly narrow mid foot/volume so my foot ends up squeezed into them regardless.

The Speedgoat 6 is the answer to my prayers. I went a half size up from my usual trail shoe and got the 2E version. There‚Äôs a tad bit more length than I‚Äôd like but I find that the 6 is actually a bit shorter than the 5 and I think the extra room will be nice as my runs get longer. 

The only negative I have so far is the heel does feel a bit more roomy. Due to sizing up half a size I may find myself incorporating the heel-lock takedown to avoid any slippage, though I barely noticed any on my run.

**Speedgoat 5 vs Speedgoat 6**

Compared to the SG5, the SG6 has a slightly more rounded toe box. This is the key game-changer for me because the SG5 was unwearable due to the rapid tapering into the pointed toe ‚Äî this caused my pinkies to jam up into the front. This is not an issue at all in the SG6. 

Another welcome change for me is a slightly more flared forefoot and heel midsole. This shoe feels exceptionally stable. Anyone with minor pronation like me will greatly appreciate added width.

**run performance**

Honestly, not going to be much help here. It‚Äôs pretty light, rockered enough to give some help and feels pretty nimble and stable on the 2 miles of rocky terrain I took it on here in the Southwest.

Overall, I‚Äôm absolutely in love with the shoe for the simple fact that I have a shoe that actually fits me from toes to heel and I‚Äôm not muffin topping over the edges. If you couldn‚Äôt fit into the SG5 due to the toe box or narrow fit, I definitely encourage trying the SG6 (try up half a size as well for good measure).

Negatives:

Does not feel very cushioned

Overview:

I bought this pair directly from Hoka for ¬£120 which is more than I would typically pay for a daily trainer, but I wanted to try new Hoka models after hearing a lot of good things about this year's releases.

The purpose of the Mach 6 was supposed to be a daily/long trainer. I do not really distinguish between the two anymore - I typically reach for higher stack dailies which I can also use for longer runs. I am therefore always looking for shoes that feel comfortable for anything between 8k and 32k and any paces from recovery through to marathon pace. Previous pair in this spot was Endorphin Speed 3s.

Firstly, what the hell is going on with Hoka's sizing? This is the first time I had to reach for anything larger than my UK 9. I landed in UK 9.5 in the Mach 6 and then quickly realised why. Most brands translate UK 9 to men's US 10 and EU 44. In Hoka, that's a UK 9.5. A bit confusing.

Secondly, as someone with normal width feet, perhaps slightly on the narrow side, I was surprised to find how narrow these run. Now normally, narrow is good for me. Like I said, I don't have wide feet and actually prefer a snug fit in my shoes. My ES3 were a bit too loose in the forefoot for my liking. Again, new experience in Hoka and a very confusing one - they run too narrow out of the box. My midfoot felt tight, my toes felt squashed from the sides. I didn't get any blisters or uncomfort from this, but it is not a pleasant feeling.

Upper also runs a bit hot for me. It does not feel very breathable compared to the ES3. Quite dissapointing in a lightweight trainer like this. I probably did not do myself any favours by picking the black colourway and perhaps I wouldn't do it if I knew this would be an issue. As a result of this and the narrow fit, I have to wear thinner socks in these to improve comfort. I usually run in Feetures Elite Light Cushion. I had to swap to Elite Utra Lights after the first run, which I don't normally run in very often.

On a positive side, very good comfort in ankle and tongue area. Lacing feels very secure, easy to work with and achieve a good lock down. Adidas take notes - it's not rocket science. One thing I would add is perhaps a loop for the laces so they don't flap around as they are on the longer side.

In terms of the ride and comfort, unfortunately they were disapointing yet again. Initially I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of foam right under the ball of my foot. I very often struggle to find a geometrically-fitting shoe in this area (most rockers start a bit too early for my liking). This feeling quickly disapeared when I started running. Somehow suddenly the drop felt a bit higher, the slab of foam underneat my forefoot was gone and I just didn't feel anything positive about it. I was not bottoming them out, but at the same time they didn't feel that cushioned anymore and I wasn't getting much bounce back. First run was 13 miles, half of which at marathon pace and I also threw some strides in just to see what they feel like at full burst paces. Uninspiring is again the answer, but I wasn't expecting fireworks from a daily trainer. After the first run I felt confused and wanted to go back to my ES3. Hoka didn't give me better comfort, cushion or speed. I struggled to justify why I would pick these over the Sauconys. Not even for easy runs.

Second run was a race. Not my typical shoe choice for a race, but I sent my VF2 back to Nike under warranty and I thought maybe these shoes are made to go faster and I just didn't see them. I said why the hell not, come on and surprise me. Race was around 5 miles, undulating route, I kept it around the 10k/treshold effort with a sprint finish. They did ok, I didn't really think much of it to be honest. No noticable bounce or propulsion. I felt like I was doing all the work and wasn't getting anything back from the shoes. Expected from a daily trainer really. Again, I thought, where are all the good reviews coming from them? They don't work at easy, they don't work at MP, they don't work at 10k, I don't get it.

Next up was park run. I wasn't expecting much at this point. Went a bit quicker than in the previous race. Admittedly I finally started feeling some return at this pace, but this effort was a lot quicker than I would ever use a daily trainer for. This pace is probably where the shoe felt the best for me from all the four runs I did so far, but I didn't really buy it to race 5k's and they were far from the best shoes I'd pick for the distance.

Even though I do not really believe in having to break in shoes, at this point I thought I had a slab of EVA on my feet and MAYBE, just MAYBE, they do need a few good miles to start feeling good. Even though that's automatically a disqualification in my book. I don't want to suffer for 60 miles just to then get 200-300 good miles out of a pair. But I carried on and did a couple of more easy runs.

At this point I had this work trip coming up and I decided I'd just pack light and fly in the Hokas. I spent 3 days in these, covered some airport miles and a couple of easy runs in the Swiss countryside and their beatiful gravel roads. This experience was quite simillar to my first run and I didn't feel that the midsole was changing in any way. One thing I have to give Hoka is that these are super comfortable for walking. I loved having them on my feet all day.

TL;DR: I don't know where these would fit in my rotation. They are definitely not the do it all shoe I was looking for like the ES3 were for me. I put some thought into this and I would probably appreciate them more as a beginner runner, picking them up as my first serious pair of runners. In the position I am today I think I had run in too many shoes much better than these to appreciate them.

Worth buying?:

On return I checked and noticed that I am still within the 30 days return period. Unfortunately this pair is going back. Disapointing, uninspiring, average at best. If I had to compare them to another shoe I had, it would be the Velocity Nitro 2. But the thing is that you can buy the Pumas for 50 quid and I paid 120 for the Hokas.",2024-06-15 12:32:40+00:00,30,22

1dfvie0,RunningShoeGeeks,First Run: 5K in the Mizuno Neo Vista (plus thoughts vs Hoka Skyward X),"**Background:** I'm a relatively new runner. Started in March of this year in preparation for a half marathon in October. 170lbs, 5'8"", size 10 with a slightly wide forefoot. Typical 5K pace is around 9-10mins/mile.

**Fit:** The Mizuno fits like a glove. Initially I thought the sock fit around the ankle would cause irritation, but I didn't really notice it during the run. The last eye loops have the laces traveling inside the shoe, but I didn't feel them at all using ankle socks. The shoes lock my foot down very nicely.

**Stability:** I pronate a bit and cannot use some of the shoes that are popular here because of that. These shoes have pretty wide platform and provided more than enough stability for my running style. You can feel part of extra cushion around the outer parts of the foot, and I thought that would force me to pronate a little, but my foot sank into them during the run and didn't cause any issues. 

**Ride:** I was really excited to try these based on all of the rave reviews, but while I was out there, I wasn't....amazed. I also own the Asics Nimbus 25, and these feel like a plated, more responsive version of that. The run was fine and comfortable, but nothing about it stood out to me. If you're looking for a faster Nimbus, this might be it.

**Vs Skyward X**: When I first tried the Skyward X, it was a bit of a revelation to me. Prior, I had run in 1080v12, Nimbus 25, Clifton 8, and a couple runs in the Endorphin Speed 2 (too unstable for me). It was cushioned, but firm, responsive, and propulsive. I look forward to running in the Skyward X despite my minor issues with the fit. Yes, the Neo Vista is lighter, but it ""feels"" slower, while the Skyward is heavier, but feels faster. The Neo Vista feels lower to the ground, and doesn't have as much of the ""rocker"" feel as the Skyward.

I'm finding that I trend towards firmer feeling shoes, and not the marshmallowy feeling ones. Maybe my weight has something to do with it? 

I'll be taking the Neo Vista out on Sunday for a scheduled 9-mile run, but at the moment, I give the edge to the Skyward X for its firmer and faster feeling.",2024-06-14 16:52:41+00:00,29,20

1ddsgk0,RunningShoeGeeks,Hola Mach 6 Review,"178cm tall, 80kg, avg runner mid-forefoot striker.

So a little review on the Mach 6 for those interested!

Never had a Hoka before, but blown away by how nice these are, they‚Äôve become my new daily trainer as someone who‚Äôs always been more comfortable in lighter shoes, and these have replaced my ON Cloudeclipse, I have review for these up in which I explain why I don‚Äôt wear them anymore.

I‚Äôve run plenty of longer runs, 15-20km at about 5-5:20/km pace and sessions down to 400m intervals at up to 3:20/km pace. The Mach has handled them all perfectly.

Upper: Not bad, not great, rather thick heel cup and the upper doesn‚Äôt stretch too much overall like some other brands do these days, but it‚Äôs comfy, it‚Äôs secure, and it doesn‚Äôt rub anywhere either so it‚Äôs a safe option and does the job

Midsole: Definitely the reason you buy these as anyone would know by this point. Super light, still very cushioned albeit by modern standards being a tempo or lightweight trainer, the plush feeling is there, its springy, its responsive, its comfortable. It‚Äôs simple in a way I like, no plate gimmicks or anything to get in the way of an all round good foam that pops when you give it speed and keeps you safe for longer runs. No need to go into the specs of what foam and all that, it‚Äôs just that, it‚Äôs simple and effective. Also the heel toe drop is just right for me at 5mm, enough to let your body do the work and keep strengthening all those micro muscles in the foot and building calf strength but also forgiving. All round it‚Äôs an 8.5/10 for me, love it.

Outsole: I haven‚Äôt had the previous versions but the outsole goes okay, confident it‚Äôll last into the 600km+ range, however it is a little slippery on certain types of concrete. I run on a wide variety of concretes and we‚Äôve had almost entirely rainy weekends since I got the shoe so my long runs are always filled with wet patches. Nothing concerning, but I‚Äôve definitely felt like I‚Äôve had to slow down a tiny bit if there‚Äôs slippery driveways I have to cross. Otherwise it‚Äôs decent.

Conclusion: A solid all round trainer for any workout or long run, it‚Äôll do the job well no matter what. If you slip a lot maybe look elsewhere but otherwise it‚Äôs worth a try and probably even a buy. The more you put in the more you get out of it.

 I‚Äôm looking to move to Altras (never had these before) or back to Brooks Cascadia. 

I‚Äôve loved hokas but my last pair haven‚Äôt lasted long enough - the fabric on the top of the trainer has ripped and the soles have started wearing away too quickly and on some terrain they aren‚Äôt grippy enough. I‚Äôve also found that they just feel too chunky on my feet. 

Any advice welcome :)",2024-06-10 19:55:53+00:00,1,13

1dcmaic,XXRunning,Race day shoes that don‚Äôt completely break the bank?,"Howdy!

I have a half marathon planned for July 4. I‚Äôve been doing my training in a pair of Hoka Cliftons for most of my runs and ASICS gel Nimbus for my longer or more intensive runs. I love the feel of the ASICS, but I feel like the toe box is maybe a little too narrow and leads to a bit of hot spotting on the tops and outside of my smallest toes. 

Of course all the Instagram Girlies‚Ñ¢Ô∏è are rocking the Alphaflys, but this is my first race and $285 for race shoes as someone anticipating a finish time of ~2:30 seems a bit excessive. Does anyone have any good recommendations for a comfortable race day shoe that won‚Äôt have me eating beans and rice before the race to balance my budget?",2024-06-10 14:03:41+00:00,15,40

1dc8wsc,RunningShoeGeeks,361 Degrees Flame ST: First Run Thoughts,"I know these are a few years old, but these are my first plated trainers so here my initial thoughts:

To preface, I‚Äôm a heavier runner‚Ä¶ past year I‚Äôve hit the gym super hard, put on about 15 lbs in muscle and lost about 37 in fat. I‚Äôm what the kids call ‚Äúyoked fat‚Äù and definitely have a dad bod stomach lol. My current PB mile is 7:49, 5K is 28.53, and 10k is 1:01:02. I‚Äôm not a record-breaking runner, so consider this a review from an average fella who just enjoys running.

These shoes have a hint of the looks from the Endorphin series, and a feel of a firmer Triumph 20. They‚Äôve got a full length plate running through it, allowing it to have a great roll through. You really notice the push forward about 75% through the foot strike, and it‚Äôs a pretty noticeable push forward. The materials seem to be pretty good on the upper, I wasn‚Äôt having that hot foot feeling that you get mid-summer. Today was 98 with a super high humidity, and it felt great.

I‚Äôm a heavier runner, 215 lbs (97.5 kilos), and the reviews I‚Äôve read that some people think the foam is on the firmer side. I tend to subscribe to the fact that since I‚Äôm heavier, those types of foams work better for me. The midsole is almost like the triumph 20 in the beaded TPU foam, and it feels great. My first run today with them was 5.5 miles (a little less than 9k) and the experience was great. I didn‚Äôt have any Achilles issues like I sometimes do when I break out new shoes. I ran a 8:55/mile (5:45-ish/km) and the biggest thing I noticed about these shoes is the mid-foot is very narrow. The toe box is nice and wide, I had plenty of space for my toes to splay properly. No heel slip whatsoever. The midfoot took some getting used to. I believe it got to about mile 3 before I stopped noticing this - it wasn‚Äôt quite uncomfortable but it was noticeable that I stopped and retied my shoes to give a little more room in the mid-foot, and it completely eliminated that problem.

I had no stability problems throughout the run, and ultimately have decided that these are going to take the place as my new ‚Äúdaily‚Äù shoe. I‚Äôve got Triumph 20 as my long run shoe, and Hoka Rocket X as my 5K/10k race shoe. I actually think if I were to ever do a half marathon, I‚Äôd use the 361 Flame ST as my shoe because it‚Äôs just so much more comfortable than the Rocket X. They seem to be reliable in the outsole category, I‚Äôm a heel striker so we‚Äôll see how this holds up over time.

1dc5l6f,Shoes,Rocker sole hiking boots that are cushy but rigid?,"Have painful foot issues - hallux limitus and metatarsalgia. Day to day I use Hoka Bondis with an insole insert. I have a pair of the Hoka Kaha2 high-tops that I bought for hiking but they are not good. Not enough rocker, not enough cushion, and the sole is way too flexible.

Have you any recs for a hiking boot with a rocker sole that is rigid like a hiking boot should be but also has some cushioning? I can probably go with less cushioning if the rocker and rigidity are good. Thanks.",2024-06-09 22:03:24+00:00,1,0

1dbx5j1,sesamoid,"Sesamoid fracture, what worked for me, and what didn't ","I was diagnosed with a fibular sesamoid fracture in early January and it‚Äôs taken me 5 months to get near normal again and during that time I went through so much pain and confusion trying to figure this¬† out, including going to three podiatrists who all gave different advice (and were all rather weird btw). I wanted to post something in hopes of helping others with this issue.¬†

**WHAT DIDN‚ÄôT WORK**

**X-rays**. I was initially told my fracture had separated the bones ‚Äúnon-union‚Äù which had me feeling really depressed about the likelihood of ever getting better. I found out months later with an MRI that wasn‚Äôt true, it was a stress fracture. The fun part was Podiatrist 1 trying to pretend like this is what he had told me all along.¬†

**A full walking boot**. I wore this awful thing for 6 weeks and it resulted in more pain because the pumping action swells up your forefoot. Then Podiatrist 2 said something that just intuitively made sense, that you don‚Äôt need to isolate your entire foot and ankle for a broken sesamoid, all you need is to offload the sesamoid. He put me into a less cumbersome orthopedic shoe along with a foot wrap sock thing he made (it was like a thick piece of foam wrapped in a gauze so the other side of my forefoot was so heavily padded that my sesamoid wasn‚Äôt really ever touching the ground for a while).¬†

**BPC-157** expensive supplement that just made me feel like crap¬†

**Dancer pads**. On their own, they are way too small and too thin for a fracture.¬†

**WHAT MIGHT HAVE WORKED**

**Contrast bathing**. I bought these big plastic ugly foot soak things called WMHYLYH Foot Bath Shoes off Amazon which made making one warm one and one icy one easy (pro tip, the warm doesn‚Äôt need to be hot, just mildly warm)

**Supplements**: Boron, Strontium, Calcium bone maker, horsetail etc.¬†

**WHAT DID WORK**

**MRI**. Get a MRI! You don‚Äôt really know what‚Äôs going on until you get one.

**Advill and foot ice bath** ‚Äî IF you have forefoot swelling and pain, especially from wearing a boot, doing this several times a day will bring it down¬†

**Exogen bone stimulator** ‚Äî do I KNOW this worked? no. but it‚Äôs one thing everybody I talked to seem to agree on as helpful. I bought a used one on Facebook marketplace for like $300 and I‚Äôve used it twice a day.¬†

**TB-500**‚Ä¶ It very easily have been a coincidence, but I started seeing improvement shortly after adding this supplement

**These type of shoes**: **Rocker shoes WITH carbon insoles built in**. It has to be both rocker AND the carbon insoles (not carbon inserts like they sell on Amazon, but shoes that have it built into them). Such as Hoka Mens Skyward X and Hoka U Transport X. For sandals, the OOFOS Original Recovery Sandal is absolutely fantastic. Now what really worked, is combining those above shoes WITH .... 

**This DYI insole** ‚Äî Don‚Äôt skip reading this one!!! It‚Äôs amazing there isn‚Äôt any insole products out there that you can buy that are right for this.  Once I progressed out of the boot and ortho shoe, once my swelling had gone down around month 3, nothing that any of the podiatrists gave me or created for shoe inserts really worked, they were okay at best. I bought four different insoles online, and none were great. Then I made something on my own, and it‚Äôs super easy to make. I bought very padded triple layer insoles called ‚ÄúMEGAComfort PAM Diabetic‚Äù ‚Äî they‚Äôre the ones with the peach color tops. And then I simply cut out the top layer around the entire sesamoid area. I attached a photo. I replaced in the insoles in my regular shoes with these (you might have to trim the edges a bit to get the fit right), and this was the first time I could walk without any significant discomfort in months. I‚Äôve now been using them for 2 months and still swear by them. But this is for After you've made enough progress that you can go back to normal shoes, it's probably not enough off loading for early stage of fracture healing. Also: I just got custom insoles made from Upstep for $200 that were designed for my sesamoid issue and these things I made for $30 with a pair of scissors are still more comfortable.¬†

**Time and patience** \-- this takes a lot longer to heal than anyone will tell you. i felt like i was never going to get better for the longest time, then suddenly i started getting noticeably better week after week. I'm still not 100 percent, and occasionally will have bad days, that's normal.

**Cortisone shot**. This is for AFTER the fracture heals. So... two podiatrists said I shouldn't get a cortisone shot. Then an orthopedic surgeon who specializes in foot and ankle said it's totally fine to do. It definitely helped. 

AND last but really should be first:

**Dr. Blake‚Äôs list of suggestions**, which I found on this subreddit. [https://www.drblakeshealingsole.com/2021/05/sesamoid-fracture-dr-blakes-office.html](https://www.drblakeshealingsole.com/2021/05/sesamoid-fracture-dr-blakes-office.html) ‚Äî This was insanely valuable. Particularly things like telling me how much discomfort is OK ‚Äî 0-2 out of 10. Nobody else could answer this. I was constantly worried as I transitioned out of boot how much discomfort was too much, what might set back my progress. Everybody says you have to be so careful and not re-injure yourself and have a setback, but they don't tell you what amount of pain is OK since obviously ZERO pain is not an option. Blake points out that not only is some discomfort okay, but NO discomfort could mean you‚Äôre not doing enough ‚Äî  not using your foot isn't good for your foot and could delay healing . Also this line: ‚ÄúTHEY ALMOST ALWAYS HEAL‚Äù ‚Äî I really needed to hear this, especially after, frankly, reading too many horror stories, on this subreddit as well

Good luck everyone!

PS. Another bit of advice from Podiatrist 2: He's seen people over the years that have some other injury find out on the x ray or mri that ALSO have an old sesamoid fracture and didn't even know it and had no issues from it. So he was like, plenty of people are running around with this fracture not  knowing they have it. the goal isn't to get to a point where you have a perfect x ray, bc that's really tough to achieve with this, it's just to get you to where you have no symptoms or problems.",2024-06-09 16:02:41+00:00,24,20

In terms of clothes I plan on bringing, as I mentioned I‚Äôm from SoCal so just basic stuff like shorts, plain t shirts, tank tops, hats, hoodies and a couple polo or button ups in case we end up anywhere with a modicum of a dress code.

Given that this is a sneaker forum I figure many of you have packed for similar longish trips with limited luggage space and had to narrow down your sneaker collection to a handful of shoes to pack. Any tips, suggestions, or advice is appreciated, worst case I‚Äôll just draw names out of a hat if I can‚Äôt decide haha.

1db97vr,Marathon_Training,Jackson river full marathon done! First marathon lessons learned,"I trained HARD that last few months since February. Back then I have been lifting for a year, weighed 5'8"" at 245 pounds. Some muscle as well as fat. I started running and laid off the gym around march to focus on my training. Since then I have been putting in 20-30 mile weeks pushing paces and hill sprints. Most of my long runs turned into pace pushers. I showed up to race day thinning out to 220 pounds. And I still had toned arms so don't worry about losing muscle all that much with proper nutrition. Your goal is running after all.

The greatest thing I did was hired a coach to help with my specific situation to find some more self efficacy early on in March during my training because I had no Idea if the plan I was following was helping anything. If anyone here is asking questions about specific related pace questions, working around a kink in their injuries or any of the specific weight matters or strength related worries, HIRE A COACH. I would have backed out 5 times over and not shown up today if I didn't have a coach to help put me through showing up to training. Whether physical coaches or online the extra knowledge and support goes a long way. And if you need to hear it from me, put your ego to the side as well which I had to do to be humbled with my training and make it count. Train in harder weather conditions than what race day will call for.

After your training efforts understand your heat index in your area to prep for race day. Your taper might throw off your nutrition but continue to eat calorie dense foods and consume electrolytes like they are kamikaze shots at the bar leading up to race day. Don't wait till last minute the night before to carb load. Maybe do some heavier eating days 2-3 days out and the night of while you hydrate. You trained hard, enjoy the extra food. 

Plan to break in your race day shoes. The market for shoes and having them in stock with your specific size is asinine. I have went through 3-4 brands at my local store and went with the endorphin elites which I had to order online. New balance and hokas were few between to find in my size.

And know what fuel works for you. I delt with stomach cramps for an hour after mile 11 since consuming a caffeine honey stinger that didn't agree with me. Liquid gu and pickle shots worked wonders and bananas throughout aid stations. 

And guess what, if you prep enough and show the heck up for your big day, you'll finish your race and you'll still be alive too!! ",2024-06-08 18:20:32+00:00,27,2

1daq429,FootFunction,Undiagnosable discomfort in forefoot,"I went for a 10 mile run about two years ago and increased mileage too quickly and wore shoes I didn‚Äôt normally wear. My foot hurt really badly after the run for about a week pretty much all over. Most symptoms cleared up (at the time I had some sharp pains and burning along the tendons). 

Now, almost two years later, I have a lingering feeling of discomfort that won‚Äôt go away ever since the long run. It isn‚Äôt painful, but it feels sort of like there is something lodged between my third metatarsal and the surrounding areas, blocking my foot from moving correctly. I have been able to resume most low impact exercise, but I still haven‚Äôt been able to work back up to running. Any time I try a run, it hurts the next day. It feels like a dull ache that never goes away and often is felt in the whole foot. After multiple strenuous days of a lot of activity, such as a lot of walking or not wearing my best shoes, I will have a flare up where the dull ache lasts longer than a day. But even when I wear my hoka bondis and rest the foot, I can get the dull ache to go away, but the discomfort feeling has never gone away.

I‚Äôve been to many doctors, done two rounds of PT, and had MRIs and X-rays and everyone is stumped. Initially thought it was a neuroma, but that didn‚Äôt show up on the MRI. There is some scar tissue there that one doctor tried dry needling. Hurt like hell and didn‚Äôt make it any better. There is evidence of a distended bursa near the area, but my Dr is surprised this would still be an issue. I‚Äôve had two rounds of cortisone shots to the bursa that haven‚Äôt seemed to help. I also have a 10 year old fully healed stress fracture in the same area. 

While I can resume normal life for the most part, I still am limited by not being able to run and extended time on my feet like music festivals, backpacking, etc. And it seems like in the last year, little to know progress has been made. I‚Äôd love any insight from those in this community who might think they have answers. I see a lot about pain in forefoot, but not much about this underlying feeling of discomfort that never seems to go away. ",2024-06-08 00:23:20+00:00,1,2

1da64cl,RunningShoeGeeks,Review: 500 km on HOKA Bondi 8 from a heavy runner,"I thought i would share a few of my thoughts on this chunky monster after realizing i have ran over 500 km with them!

**Pictures**

Forefoot grip is completely gone. Had no idea until having purchased a new pair (which im returning) 

https://imgur.com/a/nJiVULp
 
**About me**

Male, 36 years old, 180 cm (~6 ft) and 95 kg (210 lbs). Running for less than a year; slow zone 2 pace is 7 min/km and 5K pace is 5:15 min/km. Recently got a 10K PB of 54:57

**Fit**
 I own Clifton 9, Bondi 8 and Mach 6 from HOKA and their sizes are 11, 11, and 11.5. I actually think the clifton I should have also upgraded to 11.5 but has been ok so far. I never wear it for long runs. The bondi 8 has more space at the toebox so at 11 it was TTS for me. Being my first shoe, i never actually noticed how heavy it is, but it is incredibly obvious if you are trying them at the store at a treadmill and just go from Clifton to Bondi. 

**Long Story and Review**

Anyway, i started running on thanksgiving 2023 after my aunt, who is a marathon runner at 57 years old, mentioned that the half-marathon of Lisbon would be on my birthday (March 2024). She convinced me to do it with her and we started training for it. Mind you, before this, i would only run the occasional 5K for fun, and once a year would run the city's 10K. Never anything longer than that.

Now, my wife, she is a runner and she recommended i tried her favorite shoes: the HOKA clifton 9. So i did, and i really liked them (but again, i had no idea what to look for in a shoe besides good fit). However, the salesman gently recommended the Bondi 8, which are a lot chunkier, but he says he usually pushes them to people over 90 kg, since it can make runs a bit gentler on the knees. My goal was to just FINISH the half marathon, not really training for any specific finishing time, so i focused on my biggest priority: not getting injured. 

I had no idea whatsoever about shoe rotations, so i actually ran every single road run using the Bondi 8 and all my treadmill runs (once a week) with the Clifton 9. I followed the NIKE Half Marathon plan and i was able to finish my half marathon in 2 hrs 26 mins! I was very happy considering that the heat in Lisbon was a lot worse than expected and people were fainting left and right.

As per the shoe, i had zero complains about it. It helped everytime with my slow paces, and i was able to do my tempo and fast paces very well with it. I think it was the best possible choice as a new runner training for its first half distance run. I had no pain at all during my training, even in the end of the training block when i was running 30-40 km a week. Before this, i had only tried running on Pegasus 40 but i found that after a while i would start getting some plantar fasciitis with them so i did not enjoy running with the pegs.

Now, let me tell you i am very glad i didnt know about this community before starting running, because i would have been scared to try them! all the reviews i found here deeply dislike the shoe because of its size and lack of power return. And you know what? Every one of you is right! The shoe is actually pretty bad for speed and i know this because now that i have the running bug, i have started reading a lot more about shoes and trying different brands and holy hell! These things are clogs! and heavy! and definitely slow you down! The first time i ran with my Clifton 9s on the road i could not believe how much faster i was running with the same effort!

**Final thoughts**

I know have a much better rotation system: Hoka Mach 6, hoka Clifton 9, Asics Superblast and Asics Nimbus 26. I will definitely not comeback to the Bondi 8 now that I have a bit more experience but I can tell you that I am very happy that I started with them and they are the reason why I now cannot stop running. Perhaps a little too much information can be a deterrent for new runners to just get on the road and run, run run, specially when encountering choice paralysis with all the different kinds of shoes out there.",2024-06-07 08:59:31+00:00,49,12
1d9fsge,RunningShoeGeeks,Saucony Endorphin Speed 4 after >100km - My favorite shoes ever!,"https://preview.redd.it/0tafm81irx4d1.jpg?width=2138&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aea48e55f3a543f27f3ff31665086a937e68f267

TLDR : Best shoes I‚Äôve ever owned in years of running

**Intro**

I originally bought these shoes along with 3 others, since I always buy 2-3 pairs of running shoes for my annual rotation (I do half-ironmans and half marathons throughout the year, so lots of running at various paces). I ordered Hoka Mach 6, Saucony Endorphin Speed 4, On Cloudeclipse and NB Fuel Cell Rebel V4. I was looking to keep 2, one as a daily/tempo trainer, one as an easy day/daily trainer. I was originally going to settle on the Endorphin Speed 4 and the Mach 6, but since I'm such a huge Hoka fanboy and a sucker for lightweight shoes, I decided to keep the NB instead of the Hoka to switch it up a bit, probably also a bit influenced by how many of my favorite reviewers hyped up the NB (spoiler alert: it was a bad idea, you can read my review about them in another post)

**The size and fit of the shoe**

I got the Saucony in 44.5, and was mind blown by the perfect size and fit. I have pretty thin feet, but am very keen on having a large enough toebox for my toes to splay, since I wear barefoot shoe daily (vivobarefoot). My toes have plenty of room to splay and there is zero friction on the tips of toes, so in terms of width and length, feels perfect. In terms of the fit of the upper, I was also positively suprised, the upper and tongue is almost plush and perfectly hugs my foot and I find the lacing system to be very good, I didn‚Äôt expect such a comfortable, almost plush upper on such a shoe. The lockdown is perfect, so I have plenty of space in the front my toes and at the same time zero movement in the rest of my foot.

So all in all a 10/10 for me, I think these are the best fitting and feeling shoes I‚Äôve ever owned.

FYI I‚Äôm a 10.5 US / 44.5 EU in every single running shoe I‚Äôve owned from Hoka, Altra, On, ‚Ä¶ So I would say these are true to size in my experience.

**The type of running you used the shoe for (e.g. road, trail, track)**

Strictly road running.

**The distance ran in the shoe (e.g. 10k, half marathon, etc.)**

I ran over 100k in these shoes inlcluding 2 half-marathons

**Your personal experience with the shoe (e.g. comfort, durability, support)**

My personal experience with this shoe has been absolutely stellar. This is my first ever plated shoe, and while I had some minor soreness in my calves after the first two times I tried them, this faded away and I‚Äôm left with a shoe that is super bouncy in the midsole with great energy return, for me it has the perfect balance between firmess and bounciness. I have a pretty flat half marathon coming up this weekn and gonna try and run a PB in these! And as mentioned earlier, the fit is a 10/10 for me, so much so that I want to shift my entire rotation to Saucony if they all fit this well (I‚Äôm looking at the Pro 4 or Elite for a carbon racer). I‚Äôm pretty late to the party with these shoes, as everyone hyped them up last year and I promised myself to get a pair this year.

I also think these could do well for daily training and as an easy day shoe, with the cozy fit, however for my they‚Äôre a tempo day shoe, every time I put them on I just want to go fast.

So all in all, my conclusion is that I‚Äôve run in many models of many brands in the past years including Nike, Adidas, Hoka, Altra, Salomon (for trail running) and I can confidently say that these are my favorite shoes ever in terms of both fit and feel.

1d9evpt,RunningShoeGeeks,New Balance Fuel Cell Rebel V4 - Beware of sizing,"TLDR : NB sizes a tad shorter from other brands in my experience

**Intro**  
I originally bought these shoes along with 3 others, since I always buy 2-3 pairs of running shoes for my annual rotation (I do half-ironmans and half marathons throughout the year, so lots of running at various paces). I ordered Hoka Mach 6, Saucony Endorphin Speed 4, On Cloudeclipse and NB Fuel Cell Rebel V4. I was looking to keep 2, one as a daily/tempo trainer, one as an easy day/daily trainer. I was originally going to settle on the Endorphin Speed 4 (spoiler alert: best shoes ever, you can read my review about them in another post) and the Mach 6, but since I'm such a huge Hoka fanboy and a sucker for lightweight shoes, I decided to keep the NB instead of the Hoka to switch it up a bit, probably also a bit influenced by how many of my favorite reviewers hyped up the NB.

**The size and fit of the shoe**

I tried the 44.5 and 45 sizes. 44.5 felt a tad small, but by a few mm, and 45 felt like a clown shoe. FYI I'm a 44.5 (or 10.5 US) in every single other running shoe I own, Hoka, Altra, Saucony. So while everyone online seems to be saying they fit true to size, I don't really agree, I think you should size up by 1/2 size, at least in EU sizing). The fit and lockdown was good in the 44.5, the toebox is wide which I love as a daily wearer of mostly barefoot shoes. However, the toebox felt a bit short, by a few mm, especially near my big toe (this slightly short toebox has been mentioned by other reviews online). I figured it was probably fine and kept them in 44.5 since the 45 was a no go.

**The type of running you used the shoe for (e.g. road, trail, track)**

My plan was to have this as an easy day/daily trainer shoe, so anything easy up to 10k, mostly road.

**The distance ran in the shoe (e.g. 10k, half marathon, etc.)**

I ran 3-4 times in this shoe, a few easy 5k and 8k.

**Your personal experience with the shoe (e.g. comfort, durability, support)**

My personal experience with this shoe, other than the fact that is was a bit too short, was positive. I did find it extremely soft, perhaps a bit too much. This softness is not really compensated with a nice bounce off (which is not really an issue for me as it was originally planned as an easy day shoe, but I would not see myself running tempo in this). As mentioned earlier, really appreciated the wide toebox since it really allows your toes to splay wide. I also felt like it was a great shoe for forefoot strikers.

However in hindsight, this shoe's sizing is simply not suited to my foot. During my runs I felt a little bit of friction on my big toe every time, which for me is a no go in any ruuning shoe. And I could simply not get a good lockdown in the size 45. So while I really wanted to like these shoes, I had to give them up after only 4 runs. Thankfully a friend of my dad was happy to take them off my hands :)

All in all I've learned my lesson, if a running shoe ever feels to small, even in the slightest, then it probably is...

I went back and got the Cloudeclipse in a 44.5 as my easy day shoe, will post a review about those soon!

Post any questions you have in the comments happy to answer!

1d9crmq,PHRunners,Hoka Trilogy Leg 2 Experience,"Reposting as it was taken down; paraphrased to not sound like a rant I guess. 

1) No medals provided after Hoka Leg 2 in Pasay. Kind of disappointing if this was your first race and you end up not getting the whole experience you paid and worked hard for. Someone correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but as per Consumer Act I think if they don‚Äôt correct this within 30 days, consumers are subject to reimbursement of at least a portion of price paid?

2) I‚Äôve raised this with them before but Runrio continues to charge an additional Php 150 to deliver each race kit. If you try to have several kits delivered to the same address, they will still charge you Php 150 per kit (e.g., you‚Äôll need to shell out an extra 600 bucks to have 4 kits delivered to the SAME address). Last I asked why, they just said that delivery fee really is based on the number of kits.

3) So many issues with distribution of kits for Hoka Leg 2. While picking up my kit, a customer was complaining as to why their kits were released to a different person. A friend of mine also got her kit delivered that only had a singlet and no bib so she went extra early on race day to check with staff. Staff just simply didn‚Äôt believe her, called the team in charge if they really didn‚Äôt put a bib inside (of course they said they did), and told her that she had to pay to race that day.

Lexapro, birth control
I have had a Morton‚Äôs neuroma for a few years now. It started back in 2018ish when I was running for exercise. I wore a walking boot and it goes away for about a year then comes back. I went to a podiatrist who gave me a steroid shot about 2 years ago. When I usually flairs it becomes very painful like a sticker in the ball of my foot and even using a blanket will hurt. The foot also becomes very cold in comparison to the other foot. No confirmed raynauds and I have had vascular scans that are normal. 

Anyways, I lost about 80lbs and this had flared up again but it‚Äôs not as quite as painful. It is ok when I wear my hokas but any other shoe or barefoot is painful. 

Besides getting another steroid shot in between my toes, is there any home treatment I can do?  ",2024-06-05 18:48:15+00:00,1,2
1d8wvu3,Marathon_Training,Help with Long Run Training Shoe,"I ran my first half marathon last October training with Saucony Kinvara 13s for short/speed runs and Hoka Clifton 9s for long runs. I hated the Hokas.

I spent the first half of this year preparing for marathon training, averaging 20-25 mpw running solely on the Kinvara 13s. I love them. They are so light and easy on my legs. My farthest run on them was just over 15 miles. 

I am now entering marathon training. I‚Äôm starting with fresh Kinvara 13s for short/speed runs but I want a long run training shoe to throw into the mix. I tried Brooks Ghost and did not like them. All my toes were numb after 3 miles, which was the same problem I had with the Hokas. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the drop or if it‚Äôs the gel/cushion but both the Brooks and the Hokas felt too heavy/too slow and my feet just don‚Äôt like the clunkiness. I have a pair of ASICS Gel-Nimbus 25s on the way but I fear they will feel the same as the Hokas and Brooks. 

What would you suggest to pair with the Kinvaras for my longer runs? Do I even need 2 training shoes? My only goal is to finish the race.

1d8i6cz,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Carbon X3,"Disclaimer: these are my first carbon plate shoes. 

I got them at Ross for $90, and they felt good in the store. They had a prominent poppiness/springiness that my previous running shoes didn‚Äôt have (saucony ride iso). 

I went for a 3.5km interval workout run and they felt like a glove. The knit upper hugged my foot well. Not the roomiest toe box but not bad either. I wish they had an eyelet for heel lock lacing, but they held my feet well. 

Once I started my laps, it was clear that they like to go fast. They have a roll shape and the carbon plate craves force. I am a heavier runner (225lbs) and they really came alive around an 8:20min/mile pace. They felt good as a forefoot/midfoot striker, but even as a heavy runner I didn‚Äôt feel that I was loading the plate enough. Once my pace increases, I think they‚Äôll feel even better.

1d6on0l,trailrunning,Is Merrell the trail running shoes the answer now?,"Hi folks,

For the past 2/3 years I've been thru trail running shoes at an alarmingly fast speed (around 200km due to QC/durability issues).

I've picked up Merrell Agility Peak 5 during Christmas for A$130 and after 6 months (200km ish), it arguably held up the best.

Not long ago I picked up Long Sky 2 Matryx, it ticked all the boxes - Vibram Mega grip, Matryx, Durable midsole and super lightweight. All these for A$150.

After going through shoes at a rate I'm not happy with, I think I can now settle with Merrell (which was a brand I absolutely loathe about)??

Any thoughts? I'm going to do TMB + a few other hikes in EU later this year (total 700km + another 500km training distance in the next 3 months). Happy to report back for issues.

The list of shoes I've gone through so far:

\* Hoka Speedgoat 5 (amazing shoe but worst durability, I kept it as a daily errand shoe now)

\* Hoka Torrent 2 (durability issue - is that a trend Hoka?? The sole came off completely within 3 months and claimed warranty)

\* Saucony Peregrine 12 (sole worn out within 4 month/150km, the shoe also didn't fit me well)

\* Brooks Cascadia 16 (this shoe is durable but very uninspiring - heavy, slow to dry, mediocre midsole and outsole)

The brands I'm hesitated to try:

\* Salomon - mediocre outsole and heard QC issues a lot after acquisition

\* Topo - hard to find at a good price but I also hear QC/customer service problems?

\* Nnormal and other fancy cottage brands - hard to find and high price

1d6db20,RunningShoeGeeks,Mizuno Neo Vista,"TL;DR This shoe is REALLY fun to run in. It makes running exciting in a way that very few shoes have ever accomplished (ie SCTv1, PXSv1 or Cielo X1).  I love it, but it's not for everyone. 

**Profile:** 6‚Äô0‚Äù 160lb forefoot striker, 65 MPW

**Fit:** TTS men‚Äôs 11.5. Form fitting upper. 

**Other Mizuno Shoes:** WRP2

**Run:** 14 mile progression, 6mi easy, 4mi tempo, 2mi recovery w/strides, 2mi cool down. Intentionally got at least one mile at every speed in my range (except very top end) to gauge feel and performance. 

**Step in Feel:** This shoe was love-at-first-step-in for me. I had concerns about the upper but it totally, absolutely works. Though the laces aren't really necessary. 

**Midsole:** The midsole is EXTREMELY soft (even spongy) when walking/standing. It does firm up on the run, though remains amongst the softest rides in the market (think SCTv1, 1080v13, etc). 

**Where it shines:** The Neo Vista felt best to me at moderate paces. At recovery paces it felt slappy. At tempo paces it felt mushy. At long run paces it felt cushioned, bouncy, and fun as anything else I've ever enjoyed. This shoe *can* indeed pick up the pace, but it would certainly not be my racer or workout shoe of choice. It's definitely best at long run paces. But if I had to choose where it's second best, I'd say recovery paces (despite the slappyness) over tempo paces. 

**The plate:** It seems clear to me that the plate is NOT to provide pop or an aggressive toe off; it exists to provide some structure and stability (i.e. to ""wrangle"" the foam). Do not expect an aggressive race day plate experience. 

**Similar Shoes:**

* **New Balance Supercomp Trainer V1** \- The comparisons to the SCTv1 are obviously justified. The neo vista is 35g lighter (in Men's 11.5). The neo vista has a MUCH larger gap between the walls of the midsole (the ""cut out"" part that creates the trampoline effect). I measured 42mm at the widest part in the neo vista and 28mm at the widest part in the SCTv1. This makes the neo vista have substantially more ""trampoline"" effect. It also makes it even less stable. 
* **Hoka Cielo X1** \- Both shoes are just incredibly fun to run in. Both have high levels of bounce and soft cushion. Both are great for long runs. 

**Potential Cons:** 

* **Heel Lock Down** \- It is impossible to tie a runners loop with this shoe because you cannot access the second to last eyelet from the inside (there is effectively no tongue). So, if the anatomy of your own heel doesn't jive with the design of the shoe's heel counter, there will be no solution. 
* **Stability** \- This is NOT a stability shoe. If you live on the boarder between neutral and pronation, this shoe will be dangerous for you. If you're a neutral runner, this is definitely not a con for you. :) 
* **Lace Bite/Hot Spots** \- The design of the shoe requires the laces to sit against directly against your foot at the last to eyelets. This caused an issue for my running friend (who won't be keeping his Neo Vistas as a result) at the medial side of the shoe. This part of the shoe design happened to push right against a protruding bone (the little one just below and about 1"" forward from the medial ankle bone) in his anatomy. If that bone sticks out for you, you may have issues with this shoe. 
* **Slappy** \-  I mentioned this before, but at lower paces the rocker does not come to life and the ride felt a bit slappy. 
* **Loud** \- This is, admittedly, a weird thing to write in a shoe review. But, alas, here we are. The ultra wide canyon in the midsole often creates a reverse suction type noise when striking the ground. You will not get away with sneak attacks in these shoes. 

If you're a true neutral runner, looking for an incredibly FUN long run shoe, and aren't on a tight budget... you'll want to check this one out. 

Is Mizuno relevant again? Who'd have thunk...

1d61xs9,FootFunction,Soreness while breaking in orthotics?,"Hello all - I sprained my toe/tore my plantar plate last November and (at my doctor's recommendation) finally got around to custom orthotic inserts for my athletic shoes. In the meantime I've been able to run and exercise freely for the most part (sometimes the foot hurt, sometimes it didn't ... low-rise work shoes seemed to induce more aching than running in cushioned Hoka Cliftons, and kicking soccer balls hurt more than most other activities even when practicing good form (ie, not striking with the toe)).

I'm in the process of breaking in the inserts now - they are initially quote uncomfortable when I put them on but feel fine after I've walked for a few minutes, and the injured right foot already seems to be improving some overall.

However, now my left ankle (uninjured foot) is quite sore. The doc gave me inserts for both feet and instructed me to use them for both feet. Is this soreness just part of the breaking in and adjustment process?

Prior to these I was wearing a cheap pair of Asics - they worked fine I think, but I have some knee issues now and wanted to upgrade to something ""nicer"".

So I got the Clifton 7s, and the first hour or so of wearing them I thought they were amazing, but now they are causing some major pain to my inner arch. I've probably walked about 8-10ish miles in them so far.

I'm still in the return & exchange period and I'm wondering if I should exchange for a different model, or if they all have the same issues?

Hoka customer support suggested Arahi 7, Solimar, or Kawana 2. But I'm curious what you all think.

I did a search and found other people who had the same arch issue, but not many recommendations for other Hokas to try, which leads me to think maybe they all have that issue?

Any recommendations would be great.

1d35yvr,RunningShoeGeeks,New Balance 1080 v13 4E walking review,"New Balance 1080 v13 4E walking review

First and foremost, this review will be my experience after using the shoes only for walking (cannot run for some knee issues)

**Basic stats:**

- New Balance 1080 v13 4E in size EU 45.5
- 183cm & 85kg if relevant
- Wide, flat but with high volume feet (basically a pancake tower) specially wide in the midfoot
- Walked already 75 miles


**Why i choose them?**

After going to a running store, they could not fit me any shoe available there (+20 different pairs) ranging from Hoka‚Äôs, Asics, On , Altra (we‚Äôll get on the altra‚Äôs later)

Then bough a pair of altra via olympus 2 (46EU) because in the store they felt the least tight.. oh boy how wrong i was. The midftoot felt tight and ‚Äúoverhanging‚Äù a little, but i was already accostumed to that sensation so i didn‚Äôt paid much attention.. until i went for a brisk walk and returned home with sharp pain in my arch. + they are heavy asf.

Returned them right away.

after searching online and reading reviews i found these! Bought the widest size they sell in europe (4E, although in stores only they get to 2E) 

And they are wonderful.


**My thoughts:**

- toebox:  OK and allow my feet to have some space withouth being too wide

- Midfoot: is FANTASTIC, my feet don‚Äôt overhang, they fit perfectly.

- Ankle: here‚Äôs my only caveat,i find the ankle to be quite low and i have quite a bit of heel slip. Though doing a heel lock solved the issue.

- Upper: Snug but not asfixiating. It allows my feet to swell without compressing too much

- Tongue: taking into account that Ultraboost 1.0 hurt to the point of giving me blisters.. this is a relief.

- Midsole: The plushiest shoe i‚Äôve ever had. Plushiest than On Cloudmonster 2, via olympus 2, Bondi 8, Clifton, nimbus 26 


This summarizes my experience from a walking pov. But feel free ro ask any related questions!

ps: bough another pair for the future!",2024-05-29 06:58:32+00:00,67,41

Been running in a worn out pair of On Cloud flyers. Made the upgrade yesterday. Stayed in zone 3 and had my fastest two mile in almost 5 years. Just got back into running after being injured in the same amount of time. I'm really enjoying it and these shoes made it more enjoyable !

Fit and feel on my 10.5 feels very secure with enough room in the toe box to not need a wide, which I normally do. 
Feel is obviously very cushioned but surprisingly stable. The last pair of over cushioned shoes I had owned was an OG pair of hokas. These are much more stable. 

Doing a runners loop on this shoe was very helpful as well.

1d23eg4,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Clifton 9 vs. Mach 6 vs. Rocket X2 Difference in Speed,"Hello Reddit,

This is my first post here, so hopefully it meets the exacting standards of you running shoe aficionados. I'm in my third season of triathlon and wanted something faster than my Clifton 9s for speed work and racing. There seems to be no shortage of disdain for Hoka out there, but I started with them because the Bondi was super cushy and I wanted to protect a torn meniscus I have. I continue to run them because I find them comfortable and they feel much more stable than other shoes I've tried at the store (mostly short runs in the parking lot). I'm not sure I'm doing much for my meniscus at this point, but it's not causing any problems, so I continue. At any rate, nobody here came to read about my meniscus, so let's move one.

After some consideration of Hoka's line of shoes and good reviews of both the Mach 6 and the Rocket X2, I decided I'd like at least one of them. After poking around on the internet, it was difficult to find anybody weighing in on how much speed was gained by switching to faster shoes, particularly those shoes, leaving me with a dilemma. So like any good hobbyist athlete, I just bought both pairs of shoes I wanted and decided  I'd return them if either didn't work out for me after a run or two. I'm happy to say both the Mach 6 and the Rockets made it into my rotation, the Mach 6 as my speed workout shoe and the Rocket as my race shoe. The Clifton 9 is currently on the bench, waiting to replace my Bondis as my slower mileage shoe.

**About Me**

I'm 35 years old, 5' 11"", 186-ish around the time I did the shoe comparison. I'm a third-season triathlete this year, completed Ironman 70.3 Augusta in 2023. I ran a 23:08 5k in January in the Cliftons, so I think I fall into a speed category that applies to a lot of recreational runners who want to be faster but aren't sure a carbon plated shoe will help because they think they aren't fast enough.

**Methodology**

To figure out how much time the two types of shoe are saving me, I ran through the shoes on consecutive weeks for my threshold workout. I'll be using Daniels' Running Formula (DRF) notation here, with E denoting easy (conversational) pace and T being threshold (anaerobic threshold pace). My threshold workout at the time was 3x10T with 5 min E between, plus warmup and cooldown:

15 min E  
10 min T  
5 min E  
10 min T  
5 min E  
10 min T  
10 min E

I run a circuit in my neighborhood that is pretty close to 2k long and not particularly flat anywhere. In an attempt to standardize the runs as much as I could, I made sure to start the circuit at approximately the same place. I'll present my first mile split of each run, which will basically be the same mile for each rep and is a net downhill. I'll also present the 10 minute results, which will vary somewhat in length and will be net uphill. While my mile splits occur automatically (assuming I hit the lap button to start), I have to stop on the 10:00 mark manually and I did miss it in a few places. We'll just have to make the best of it.

To measure effort, I use a wrist-based heart rate monitor (Garmin Forerunner 245) and RPE. I tried to keep HR in the 140-150 range, and for RPE I was aiming for legs just starting to feel heavy (but not tired) and breathing feeling a little labored, but not so hard that it felt difficult to keep it going. Those of you familiar with HR training will notice my anaerobic threshold is low for my age range, but it has been verified by a VO2 analysis and lines up well with my threshold pace as predicted by race results according to DRF.

For those keeping track, DRF predicts I should have the following T paces based on race results:

23:08 5k (01/27/2024), avg. HR = 155 ->                           VDOT = 42 -> 7:52/mile T(Clifton 9)  
35:32 8k (03/16/2024), avg. HR = 147 -> \~44:20 10k ->   VDOT = 46 -> 7:09/mile T (Rocket X2)  
44:32 10k (04/06/2024), avg. HR = 148 ->                         VDOT = 46 -> 7:09/mile T (Rocket X2)

It's worth noting that I was just getting back into cardio training in late December from the off-season, so I likely had some higher-than-average gains getting into March and April from getting back prior fitness, rather than forging new gains. At any rate, the race results verify that my T HR should indeed be in the higher 140s and give us an idea of what my T pace should be in training.

**Limitations**

I think we're all clear this is not a particularly rigorous study, but it's worth noting a few limitations. First off, I'm one person with one workout per shoe and 2-3 reps per workout, so the results are not rigorous from a statistics standpoint. This is particularly true because I had no control over weather and conditions, and had no objective measure of my wellness other than I had no apparent symptoms of illness. I also picked up my cardio in late December after a couple of months of very little cardio, so it's not out of the question that I was recovering lost fitness in early March rather than forging new gains. In other words, it's possible I had somewhat significant gains week to week, which could skew the results. Lastly, it is absolutely possible there's some placebo effect going on here, though hopefully the HR gives us some idea of how hard I'm trying.

**Data**

Now for the good stuff. Below, I list both the first mile (should be the same mile each rep) and the 10-minute results (will vary in distance and height rep to rep). As a side note, it can take 2-3 minutes to get up to the correct HR, so that's going to pull my average HR down a little, particularly in the first mile.

03/07/2024  
Clifton 9  
Rep 1: 7:25 first mile, avg HR  = 137  
Rep 1: (no 10 minute data, forgot to hit the lap button)  
Rep 2: 7:37 first mile, avg HR = 139  
Rep 2: 1.28 miles @ 10:01= 7:50/mile, avg HR = 141  
Rep 3: 7:32 first mile, avg HR = 144  
Rep 3: 1.29 miles @ 9:59 min = 7:44/mile, avg HR = 145

03/14/2024 (only 2 reps to prep for 8k)  
Rocket X2  
Rep 1: 6:48 first mile, avg HR = 141  
Rep 1: 1.38 miles @ 10:00 = 7:15/mile, avg HR = 141  
Rep 2: 7:09 first mile, avg HR = 138  
Rep 2: 1.36 miles @ 9:58 = 7:20/mile, avg HR = 140

(35:32 8k on 3/16/2024, Rocket X2)

03/21/2024  
Mach 6  
Rep 1: 6:56 first mile, avg HR = 139  
Rep 1: 1.38 miles @ 10:03 = 7:17, avg HR = 141  
Rep 2: 7:26 first mile, avg HR = 141  
Rep 2: 1.31 miles @ 10:01 = 7:39, avg HR = 141  
Rep 3: 7:11 first mile, avg HR (mile) = 138  
Rep 3: (no 10 minute data, forgot to hit the lap button)

**Conclusions**

There was a little inconsistency here due to operator error, but we'll make the best of it. Since every workout had at least two reps and I had the first mile for every rep, that seems like a good place to start. If we average the first mile for the first two reps of every workout, we get:

Clifton 9: 7:31/mile avg  
Rocket X2: 6:59/mile avg  
Mach 6: 7:11/mile avg

Every workout also had two 10 minute reps, so we can compare those as well:

Clifton 9: 7:47/mile avg  
Rocket X2: 7:18/mile avg  
Mach 6: 7:28/mile avg

Recall that the first mile is net downhill, while the full 10 minute runs are net uphill, which explains the difference between the first mile and 10 minute paces. If we look at relative performance between the shoes, we see that the Mach 6 is right about 20 seconds faster than the Clifton 9 in both cases and the Rocket X2 about 10 seconds faster than the Mach 6 (and 30 seconds faster than the Clifton 9).

**Final Thoughts**

Before I did the experiment, I absolutely expected to be fastest in the carbon-plated Rockets, but I was blown away by the difference between the Rockets and Cliftons. I'll admit that I'm a little less sure that the true difference between the Mach 6 and the Rocket X2 is a full 0:10/mile, especially since my reps in the Mach 6 were less consistent than the Rocket X2. However, I also had the benefit of the prior week's T workout AND a solid 8k performance as training stimuli for the Mach 6, so there's an argument they should have been further apart. 

Overall, I'd say somebody who doesn't have the budget for a carbon-plated shoe could go for a lightweight traditional racing shoe and be way ahead of a trainer without losing too much on a carbon plated shoe. For Hoka, the Clifton 9 and Mach 6 are similarly priced, so having the faster shoes to rotate out for speed work and racing won't cost you any more money in the long run than just running in trainers. However, if you have the budget and want to push your PR ever faster, my experience is that carbon is the way to go.

As far as the shoes go:  
Clifton 9 - Love this as an easy mileage shoe and I found it to be comfortable for the T efforts, though obviously much slower than the other options. I normally use a Bondi for easy mileage, but goodness is it slow.  
Mach 6 - Doesn't feel like it provides much cushioning at slower speeds, feels much better at T speeds. Definitely feels more like work than the Rocket X2.   
Rocket X2 - Feels comfortable at all speeds, more comfortable than the Mach 6 at T speeds. I think this is a common thread with carbon-plated shoes, but it definitely feels easier to run in than the Mach 6.

Also, I wear a size 12 in all Hoka shoes. I didn't have to size up for the Rockets, but the snug fit of the Mach 6 and Rocket X2 have me wondering if I shouldn't be an 11.5 in the Bondi and maybe Clifton.

**TL;DR**  
-My 10k (threshold) pace is around 7:10/mile.  
-Rocket X2 was 10 seconds/mile faster than the Mach 6 in T training.  
-Rocket X2 was 30 seconds/mile faster than the Clifton 9 in T training.  
-Rocket X2 feels like it takes less effort to run than the Mach 6.",2024-05-27 21:54:00+00:00,56,14

1czkzih,AskDocs,Recovering from Severe Turf Toe Injury/MTP Sprain--Best Advice for Strengthening Feet/Ideal Shoes?,"Hello! I am kind of taking a shot in the dark here after exhausting virtually all options outside of surgery.

For context, I am 28, male, and in decent shape.

I was playing kickball and slid into second base, nearly breaking my big toe on my left foot in October of 2023. I was uninsured at the time, didn't leave it in the boot/use crutches long enough. Went to see a podiatrist, got an X-Ray, and then an MRI where they discovered...not a whole lot! That there was cartilage around the MTP joint on that big toe. I believe I was diagnosed with an MTP tear or sprain.

The joint on that big toe has been stiff, and becomes inflamed with overuse. I used to love to climb, but now the shoes are far too painful to squeeze into.

1cywvxb,FootFunction,Recovering from Severe Turf Toe Injury/MTP Sprain--Best Advice for Strengthening Feet/Ideal Shoes?,"Hello! I am kind of taking a shot in the dark here after exhausting virtually all options outside of surgery. 

For context, I am 28, male, and in decent shape. 

I was playing kickball and slid into second base, nearly breaking my big toe on my left foot in October of 2023. I was uninsured at the time, didn't leave it in the boot/use crutches long enough. Went to see a podiatrist, got an X-Ray, and then an MRI where they discovered...not a whole lot! That there was cartilage around the MTP joint on that big toe. I believe I was diagnosed with an MTP tear or sprain. 

The joint on that big toe has been stiff, and becomes inflamed with overuse. I used to love to climb, but now the shoes are far too painful to squeeze into. 

I started physical therapy two months ago, things have gotten better--but the joint still feels...wrong. At this point I worry that this will be a problem I will have for the rest of my life.

1cyub8g,RunningShoeGeeks,Nike Pegasus Trail 4 GTX ,"While there are a lot of reviews and the 5 will be coming out soon, throwing my thoughts out there. I've put almost 100 miles on them over varying terrain. They've been in snow, rain, dusty trails, pavement, cobblestones and gravel.

Fit:
I am a 10 in nearly all shoes including Nike but had to return the 10. Way too short and went with a 10.5. Now fits perfect and is not too wide in the toe area. I have a normal width foot in all brands except New Balance as they seem to run wide for me. Laces stay tied nicely.

Ride:
The React foam has softened up after 25 miles and now is extremely comfortable for short and mid efforts. Longest run has been 8 miles but have also walked 9 miles in a day. They are good for quick tempo efforts or slower paces. They don't pick up the pace easily though and don't encourage speedy efforts. Feels light when running.

Grip:
I bought these for snow but we had a light winter. However, they do work well in light snow and snowpack. I didn't need to put in sheet metal screws but might this next winter. The new mitten rubber compound on the inside forefoot grips much better in wet and rocky areas than previous versions (have had the Peg Trail 2, Wildhorse 6 and Terra Kiger 5). Consequently , it is starting to show quite a bit of wear on the softer rubber while the other rubber looks almost new. The absence of a rock plate is nice running on gravel and cobblestones as you get a better feel.

GTX:
They shed snow and water relatively well and my feet were mostly dry after a very wet rain run. They don't breathe well and in warm weather, they get hot.

Overall:
Once I sized up a half size, I have really enjoyed these for casual wear and running. Nike always kills it with their colorways and I've used these for a 1 shoe vacation rotation with ease.

I'd give them an 8/10 as they continue the workhorse tradition and very comfortable but have minor issues (sizing and breathability). I've yet to find a great trail runner that can do it all. Have tried the above Nikes, Hoka SG4 GTX, Adidas Terrex Agravic Ultra and Nike Zegama V1.",2024-05-23 14:36:07+00:00,61,41

1cw0k5h,Shoes,Could anyone recommend some slip resistant shoes for a variety of terrains?  (UK).,"Hello,

I'm looking for some shoes for rambling walks for a variety of terrains. I prefer to walk when its cooler and rainy, so it's important that the shoes are slip resistant. No foot issues, just looking for something slip resistant, comfortable after miles of walking and hopefully waterproof.

I've done a bit of research and three brands that I'm looking at are Hoka, Skechers and Brooks. Hoka's have a good reputation, but are generally the most expensive of the three brands. I don't mind paying the extra, but I've read that Hoka's don't have the best durability. For shoes that cost upwards of ¬£150, I'd like at least reasonable durability.

Aesthetic wise, I'd like the shoes to be primarily black and low cut. Aesthetics are a secondary consideration though.

1cvujws,RunningShoeGeeks,Saucony Triumph 21 - Initial Thoughts,"Currently on a marathon training block and decided to get a Triumph 21 to replace my old Triumph 19 so I will compare both shoes quite a lot. here's my profile.

# My Profile

* Height: 167 cm
* Weight: 65 kg
* Footstrike: Midfoot
* Foot profile: a bit wide on the forefoot with narrow heel
* Daily run pace: 7:00 - 7:30/km
* Shoes history: Brooks Glycerin 18 (Wide), Hoka Mach 5, Saucony Triumph 19, Puma Deviate Nitro 2, Asics Novablast 4 (US10.5 size / 28.5 cm)

Now with that out of the way, let's talk about the shoes.

# Fit

I choose my usual US10.5 size with the Triumph 21 just like with the Triumph 19.  
The toebox seems wider than the Triumph 19 since I can barely see my 5th toe protrude while on the Triumph 19 I can see the protrusion quite clearly, not as wide as Novablast 4 tho.  
While there is nothing exceptional on the toebox area, the heel area is perfect for my narrow heel. Triumph 21 is the first shoes that able to give me a proper heel lockdown with a heel lock lacing, it's mind blowing to me how a proper heel lock feels like.  
With its weird lacing system and elastic lace it's quite easy to overtighten which happens on my first run and give my a weird numb sensation on the outer side of my right feet, I can't feel my right feet from the 4th toe outwards and it feels like 1/3 of my feet is hanging, what a weird sensation. Also I can feel the ""lace eyelets"" on the side of my feet.

# Upper

Triumph 21 upper feels thicker and more comfortable but less breathable than the Triumph 19. It's kinda on par with Novablast 4 but less plushy. I suppose Triumph 21 will be a great walking shoes once it retires.

# Midsole

The midsole is kind of a letdown for me. According to RunRepeat, the midsole on Triumph 21 is 0.1 HA softer than Novablast 4, yet it feels way denser than Novablast 4. It feels just as dense as Triumph 19 but a bit bouncier. The midsole feels dense at the start of the run and gradually soften up after few km. I already accumulate more than 50k with it but the midsole still feels just as dense, I hope it doesn't take a lot to get it soften up.

# Outsole

The outsole is great, not as good as Puma's but way better than Novablast 4, barely any slippage on wet surface, I'll take Triumph 21 over Novablast 4 for rainy days. Based on my experience with Triumph 19, the outsole will outlast the midsole for me. Nothing to worry about on this part.

# Final Thoughts

The Triumph 21 is not as good as I expect, I'll use it for daily and long run but I don't think I'll use it for recovery run because the midsole is just so dense. I expect to get at least 600km with Triumph 21, just like what I get from my Triumph 19.

1cvcv4o,beginnerrunning,Shoe problems,"Hey guys, 

I am pretty new to running with about 8 months behind me. However I‚Äôve been around running as a track athlete for a long time and have a lot of runner friends. They have trouble to relate though because they are running 2:10 marathons. 8 months ago I could not 800m and I just finished my first half marathon. I need some help with some shoes though. I currently have two suitable pairs: Hoka Clifton 9, ASICS gel nimbus 25. 

The hokas give me terrible knee aches. It is probably my form/weight but still. I have retired them because I can‚Äôt deal with it.

I love the ASICS. But they kill my toenails. I keep running with them though. I feel they are my only option

I love the ASICS but my toes are suffering. After every run my index toe aches and aches with blood pooling underneath. I am about to lose the nail on both feet

I am a size 14 and I can‚Äôt size up because A 15 is too big. Should I just try it?? I don‚Äôt want to invest the money in a shoe that I trip over. 

Any shoe suggestions?

1cv6pp6,FootFunction,Foot and ankle pain for 2 months - how bad have I messed myself up? :),"I just came across this subreddit while desperately googling my various pains and I am so hopeful someone will have an answer for anything I'm going through! I feel weird about posting pictures of my feet (lol) so I'll do my best with anatomical descriptions - I work in vet med so sorry if my terms are slightly off...

To preface, I am 33F, super active until recently (distance running, bouldering, hiking, lifting for strength training) and I work 50ish hours a week on my feet. So I use those bad boys a lot and I have never once in my life had a foot, ankle or knee issue. Do I warm up enough? No. Do I cool down enough? No. Do I let myself rest enough? Absolutely not. Am I going to change my ways? YES. I swear it!

About 2 months ago I suddenly woke up with a ""sprained"" left ankle. I'd run about eight miles the previous day but did not twist or jolt anything. Just suddenly a swollen, slightly bruised, very painful left ankle \~18 hours later. I treated it like a sprain (RICE) and it literally got better over the course of the day. Great, I thought. Next morning it was suddenly sore again - but less so. I continued to ice it in the mornings and took ibuprofen and it resolved over about two weeks. Then one morning it hit the right ankle, just the same, happened overnight. Possibly because I was using my feet differently due to ankle pain, I began to have pain along my Achilles as well as some pain in the arches of my feet.

I went to the doctor at this point thinking something must be wrong. I'd just had a yearly physical with normal bloodwork a couple months before so she didn't rerun basic labs but sent out a panel looking for autoimmune stuff (RA, lupus, etc) just to be safe - all within normal limits. The pain was getting worse though. Still primarily ankles - some mornings just sore, other mornings feel straight up sprained. The foot pain (arches mainly) is worse after working, which makes sense, that's 12+ hours on my feet (but I could do that pain-free 2 months ago...). I used to retire a pair of running shoes fof work shoes (I usually run in Hoka Arahis) but bought a pair of cushy Asics thinking maybe I just needed more support. It might have helped a little I guess.

My GP sent me to an orthopedist who did rads and found nothing exciting. Since ibuprofen wasn't touching my pain anymore and naproxen was helpful but can't be taken long-term I guess, he put me on meloxicam for a month and told me to come back if pain isn't resolved by then and we'll go for MRI. And if that shows nothing they want to send me to rheumatology. Ugh!!! 

So as of right now (tl/dr-ish): Been on meloxicam for 1 week, it helps I guess but gives me headaches. Pain is felt in both ankles, but now right worse than left (I DO have an old hip flexor injury to the right hip that I think mayyybe makes me walk a little different on that side. Never had gait analyzed.) The pain is mainly on ankle rotation and I feel it when I go side to side, not up and down. I still feel slight Achilles pain on flexion (R > L). Some heel pain in the mornings only. Furthermore, I have swelling and bruising above the metatarsaophalangeal joints on my middle three toes on the left side only; it hurts to press on it or to flex these toes. I honestly cannot tell you when that happened! Noticed it about 3 weeks ago. It's not resolving.

And finally this all hurts SO bad in the mornings, and by the evenings is like, okay. Periods of inactivity make it hurt more. But I can tell being on my feet all the time isn't good for me. I didn't stop running or lifting or climbing until like, a month into all this pain... so I probably hurt myself worse. But also I'm a little worried maybe I do have something autoimmune or something scary (but no joints are affected above my ankles!!)

Anyway. Sorry that was a lot but if anyone has ANY insight please let me know. I feel like I got so lucky for years not having pain... not being able to run especially is making me go crazy, but I promise I'll be nicer to myself if anyone can just tell me how to get started! Doctors seem focused on treating the pain, but I want to treat the problem first.",2024-05-18 20:39:18+00:00,5,12

Asked an employee what gives and he said Nike recently pulled all shoes from the stores. I walked through an entire section of absolutely abhorrent monster shoes called Hoka and On. Was like walking through a burned down graveyard of ugly shoes after working at the shoe Louvre. Fine, fine, New Balance and Adidas are ok, but seeing an entire shoe section without Nikes was like watching TV on a grainy tube TV in black and white. No style, no art, no fucking RIZZ. Anyway, wondering why Nike would do this as a strategy. Does it help direct sales? Does it help gross margins to cut out the middle man?

1cspwjk,AskDocs,Recurring ankle issues post surgery - is this common?,"Hi all - 36F here. 5'4"", 140lbs.

 I was a former runner (pre-2021) that had some ankle instability and tore my right ATFL after a bad spill in March 2021. I had surgery (in Austin) to reconstruct the ligament in May 2021, and followed this with proper healing + PT for the next 4-5 months and transitioned into swimming to get exercise (never resumed running). For the next 2~ years, things seemed fine, but I started having random ankle swelling again around June of 2023.

I finally went to a foot specialist last September and an MRI showed 7 ""sprains/partial tears"". No arthritis found in an x-ray. Again, lots of recovery and downtime to heal (8~ weeks) and had a pair of custom orthotics made to work on the instability. For a while, this worked, but the random ankle pains have returned. 

I'm not a runner anymore, but a pretty avid walker (I try to get 10-12K steps a day and now live in Los Angeles, so try and be a city walker as much as possible). I tend to avoid shoes that were recommended against by my doctor and stick to Hoka's with the custom orthotics. I have multiple pairs of the same type of Hoka's, so my shoes are consistent. I'd call my previous foot doctor to revisit but he no longer takes my insurance as of the beginning of the year so I need to start from scratch with a new one.

I hate to even ask the question, but is chronic ankle instability/pain post-reconstruction surgery a thing? I have a good amount of anxiety about the discomfort/pain - my partner and I were avid hikers and I'm about to be carless (I do a lot of city walking), so the concern about my ankle health is real.

 If so, is long-term PT the solution? I'm willing to try about anything at this point to keep my walking lifestyle without pain.",2024-05-15 17:04:10+00:00,1,1

**Total distance ran:**

130 miles (209 km)

**Type of runs:**

6.5 miles (10.5km)¬†

5.6 miles (9.1km)¬†

4 miles (6.5km)¬†

**Weather ran in:**

Rain with ankle-deep puddles and dry sunshine.

**My profile:**

Height:¬†5'9""¬†(176cm)

Weight: 160.7 lbs(72.9kg)

Strike Type: Midfoot striker

Used these on the Pfitz 18/55 marathon plan for the 2024 Tokyo Marathon and will continue to use them for the Chicago block starting in June.

Averaging 8:34 min,mile/5:19min,km

**Positives:**

* Fun PEBA shoe without a plate
* Non-prescriptive ride
* Lightweight and flexible¬†
* Works with easy and faster paces
* Easy drain upper for rain and puddles
* Good wet grip
* Good durability

**Negatives:**

* Not sufficient stack for my longer runs (10mile+/16km+) to prevent beat-up feet
* Low heel drop¬†won't¬†be for everyone
* Not¬†recommended for those who have stability issues and need support

**Fit/upper:**¬†

My running shoe size is US10/27.1cm 2E.

I have 2E high-volume feet with a high instep. I like to wear fun shoes, so I have experimented with sizing up¬†and¬†it has worked pretty well for me. I have run multiple marathons and done multiple 20-mile/32 KM runs without issue.

To help you understand my feet, here is a list of shoes that fit me:

**ASICS:**

* Novablast V3 TR - Half a size up
* Metaspeed Sky - One full-size up
* Superblast - Half a size up

**Adidas:**

* Terrex Two Ultra - True to size
* Takumi Sen 8 - One full-size up
* Prime X Strung 2 ‚Äì Half a size up

**Mizuno**

* Wave Rebellion Pro 2 - True to size

**Nike:**

* Vaporfly Next%3 - One full-size up
* Streakfly - One full-size up
* Alphafly Next%2 - One full-size up
* Zoom Fly 5 - Half a size up

**Puma:**

* Deviate Nitro 2 - Half a size up
* Velocity Nitro 2 - Half a size up
* Voyage Nitro 3 - Half a size up

**Reebok:**

* Floatride Energy X ‚Äì One full-size up

**Saucony:**

* Endorphin Speed 3 ‚Äì Half a size up

I decided to opt for a **half-size¬†larger**¬†than my usual fit¬†after reading reviews that compared it to the Streakfly (more on that later).¬†The overall fit is a straightforward, minimalist racing upper without feeling overly stiff. Initially,¬†you need to loosen¬†the laces to ease your foot in, and¬†it's¬†necessary to hold the tongue and ankle collar to prevent them from folding inward. Once inside, it snugly embraces your feet, and I¬†haven't¬†encountered any issues with slipping or discomfort.

Compared to other Hoka models, the upper has a decent¬†amount of¬†volume. Those with narrow feet might find it a bit roomy. The shoe runs short, so going up half a size was a good call for me; it fits perfectly with about a¬†thumb's¬†width of space in the toe box, and I experience no heel slippage.

I was initially concerned about the durability of the¬†simple¬†mesh upper, but it¬†has held up well with minimal signs of wear. It efficiently drains water when running through puddles, which is a feature I appreciate. The upper¬†doesn't¬†retain water, which is¬†definitely¬†a positive aspect for me.

In terms of fit, I find the upper of this shoe¬†to be¬†superior to that of the Streakfly. If you found the fit of the Streakfly a bit odd but enjoyed the ride,¬†you'll¬†likely prefer this shoe even more.

**The Midsole:**

My experience with the Streakfly marked my first venture into using a ZoomX/PEBA shoe sans plate as a daily trainer.

The ZoomX foam in the Streakfly was notably soft, causing it to bottom out for me.¬†After covering around 100 miles/161 KM, I encountered an odd issue where the forefoot section had compressed while the midfoot,¬†due to the shank, remained elevated, resulting in a peculiar sensation during my runs.¬†Despite these drawbacks, it still provided an enjoyable, unadulterated ride that¬†didn‚Äôt¬†disrupt my stride.

Having traversed the same distance with the Cielo Road, I can confidently say that it is a much more refined shoe, addressing most of the issues in the Streakfly. The Peba material is firmer, providing a more responsive feel without the sensation of sinking into the shoe. Transitioning from easy to marathon paces feels smooth,¬†with¬†faster speeds easily attainable with minimal effort. Its lightweight construction gives minimal awareness of the shoes on your feet.

This shoe¬†isn't¬†as versatile as the Superblast, where one shoe does it all.¬†It‚Äôs¬†advisable to incorporate¬†it into a rotation that includes a higher stack shoe for those 10-mile/16km+ runs, as the low-to-ground feel will result in discomfort over extended distances.¬†During my Tokyo training block,¬†I used the Superblast/Prime X Strung 2 for long runs.

I appreciate the 3mm drop. Although subjective, it suits my preferences as it promotes a quicker turnover and feels more natural¬†to me.

The¬†rocker effect is subtle, providing¬†a non-prescriptive ride, which I find enjoyable.

This shoe lacks stability elements, so I¬†don‚Äôt¬†recommend it for those with stability issues.

After covering 130 miles/209km, the midsole retains its original feel, which is a pleasing outcome.

**The outsole:**

The grip has proven¬†to be¬†reliable when running in the rain and traversing through puddles, as well as encountering occasional mud on the paths, with no¬†instances of¬†slipping.¬†Aside from appearing visually dirty, the outsole has maintained its integrity remarkably well, showing minimal signs of wear so far.

**Summary:**

A¬†fun¬†lightweight shoe to run in if you¬†don't¬†have stability needs. I like to try different shoes all the time, but this is definitely something I would reconsider buying again.

1cq3jqg,RunningShoeGeeks,Puma Magnify Nitro 2 Tech,"Background - 26M, 178cm, 88kg. Feet are 2E wide in the forefoot/toebox, with long Greek toes and a small heel. Running on road and light trail. Midfoot/forefoot striker. 

24km run in these so far divided by 3 runs. 2 easy 7km runs and then a 10km run with 1km tempo reps. These shoes are fantastic. Puma grip is the bees knees but we all already know that! Very dense and firm on first wear but now it has softened up and given slightly more bounce/energy return. My first run, the foam actually started to feel softer after 4km but I think it‚Äôs just because it‚Äôs cold in New Zealand for the past week. In my tempo pace (I‚Äôm currently unfit and getting back into running) of around 5-5:20min per/Km pace these shoes really felt nice with some good energy return but it has so much cushion and stability. 

They were bought to replace my Hoka Clifton 9‚Äôs (the forefoot was too narrow and giving my 4th toes blisters, and the grip sucked) and the EVA foam just felt dead at my weight. The Clifton‚Äôs made recovery from long runs terrible for me, whereas these MN2‚Äôs save my legs the day after (probably due to the 10mm drop vs 5mm of the C9). The full max cushion stack of Nitrofoam is brilliant. The fit of these are 1/2 a size long and actually allow for my toes to splay. Midfoot is snug and heel fits nicely. Would recommend if you have narrower feet to go 1/2 size down. The upper on these are less plush compared to the regular non-tech version but they are more breathable actually from someone who has sweaty feet. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more performance material in the tech. 

These were going to be my long run/recovery/easy shoes but they are capable of some tempo pace and could easily be a daily trainer. They‚Äôre heavier than the HC9‚Äôs but they really don‚Äôt feel heavy even after 10km, possibly due to the rocker, my cadence did not suffer while fatigued (175-80spm). Just great shoes for a heavier runner. 

Overall, really happy with these for my long run shoe. Goes well with my rotation of Puma VN2‚Äôs, Liberate Nitro 2‚Äôs and NB Rebel V3. ",2024-05-12 08:56:11+00:00,68,50
1cpzz8v,BeginnersRunning,Do I have runner‚Äôs knee?,"I (20F) just started running (jogging, really) around my neighborhood for the summer. I went out for my first walk/run last Saturday, and did 3 more jogs on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. My neighborhood is pretty hilly and I was going downhill frequently. I felt great during the jogs and was happy with my heart rate so I didn‚Äôt pay much attention to my joints.

I‚Äôve spent two years focused entirely on strength training and doing stairs for cardio, so the mechanics of running is totally new to me. I did practically no research on running and thought it wasn‚Äôt anything too complicated (please point and laugh). I just wanted to burn calories and I know running is the most efficient way to do that. So sometimes I did quick treadmill jogs in Converse. Sometimes I did them in Air Forces. For the past few days I‚Äôve been running in 7-year-old completely flat Nikes (my only ‚Äúworkout‚Äù shoe). This wasn‚Äôt really a problem on the treadmill (which I only did once a month), but ever since I started to run consistently outside, I‚Äôve been wearing only the flat Nikes and paid no attention to my running form. The knee pain started during my Thursday run (two days ago) but I was dealing with a personal issue and was moving to get my mind off things, so I completed my run anyway. So now, you‚Äôve probably guessed, my knees hurt; there‚Äôs a spiking pain in the center and on the sides, especially when I walk after sitting down for a while. It was pretty bad yesterday and equally bad today. It‚Äôs nothing I can‚Äôt handle (about a 5 on a pain scale), but it‚Äôs definitely keeping me from running. As a beginner, I‚Äôve now learned that the type of shoe MATTERS A LOT and that running form also matters. I bought a pair of Hokas and I‚Äôve done lots of stretching but the pain has only gotten slightly worse.

I guess I‚Äôm mostly doubtful that three days (maybe 1 total hour) of jogging is enough to give me runner‚Äôs knee. It sounds like a pretty serious condition, so I find it hard to believe my light jogging would be enough to cause that. I‚Äôm also pretty lightweight (about 115lbs) so I think the damage I was doing was heel-striking more so than placing excessive weight on my legs. I also know basically nothing, so there‚Äôs that to consider. Also, the recovery time for runner‚Äôs knee is longer than I would like, because I really enjoy jogging and I have specific goals. Should I take the L and wait until my knees feel better to get back into jogging, having done some research to prevent this mistake again? Or is it probably not that serious, and I should continue jogging once I have the right shoe/form? If I do have runner‚Äôs knee, should I be walking anyway or just stretching it out?

TL;DR: I jogged around in a hilly neighborhood wearing completely flat shoes for a few days and now my knees hurt. What do I do?",2024-05-12 04:50:13+00:00,3,9

1cpsvdx,bunions,I need help finding shoes please!! They all hurt,"So I went to the doctor and got xrays done and a consult. He said my bunion isn't ""that bad"" and has now said that he thinks I have arthritis... except I only hurt on the bunion on the right foot. It's bad enough I can't seem to find shoes to wear. I tried barefoot shoes for awhile but the xero shoes aren't wide enough. I've ordered whitin shoes extra extra wide and it still presses this bunion. I tried on several shoes at Scheels in the extra wides. Nope. I'm wearing sandals right now and I live in a place where it gets cold and this is miserable. I want to be able to at least go walking again and would love to start jogging, but I don't see it happening.  
I personally don't believe I magically have arthritis in just my bunion on my right foot. I think he's wrong, but maybe I do?  
I asked him for advice and he said Hoka shoes... they weren't wide enough and pinched my bunion. He told me ""I don't know go to a shoe store"".

From the tip of my bunion to the other side of my foot it's 4 1/2 inches wide. I'm willing to spend too much money on shoes if need be for tennis/running/everyday shoe. I wear a size 10 in mens or 43. I'm female though but have never found girls shoes wide enough. My foot is also rather high volume too. Mostly my bunion hurts constantly, more so if touched by shoes. TY

I'm weirded out posting foot photos unless I have to -\_-

EDIT TO ADD:  I wish I could get a second opinion because I don't have much confidence in the first doctor. However I have Tricare Prime insurance and it's a pain. It would have to go back to my primary, who doesn't understand tricare in the first place, and then get approved by a regional contact person and it's an uphill battle. I've done that before for another issue. As much as I hate it I'm probably stuck with this dude.

Second edit: I ended up trying/buying/returning almost 20 pairs of shoes before finding these Propet shoes. They aren't fantastic, but they work and don't cause nearly as much pain as others. I have a followup next month with the doctor so we'll see what he says.

1cp21ds,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Cielo X1,"I picked these up at the Flying Pig expo (Thanks, Hoka rep for being patient with me trying a few pairs on!!!) and I've now had technically 2 runs in them.

The first was about 1.5 miles and very intentionally easy and nowhere near what these shoes were designed for, but I had them in mind as a backup should it have rained on the day of the Pig, so I at least wanted a couple of miles in them beforehand. 

Anyway, today was my first real run with them where I picked up the pace.

What are my thoughts?

First, like so many reviewers comment, these are not the lightest shoes to be in the ‚Äúrace day‚Äù category. My US 11.5 is 300 grams. Also, the fit runs small. I am usually an 11 or even 10.5 in some shoes (*cough* ASICS) and the 11.5 fits spot on. Do with this information what you will. 

The upper is just about the most comfortable Hoka road shoe I have worn. I still think the Speedgoat has it beat, but this is a racier upper and not a trail shoe. It's better than the Mach or the Clifton, imho. The Mach X is a close second. 

The laces suck, but using Ian‚Äôs secure knot really helps keep them from untying. Not even the usual double-knot seems effective with these plasticky-ribbon laces. Per the rep I spoke with when buying these, version 2 is going to fix that. 

One of the first things I noticed on the run is that it definitely favors more of a forward foot strike. I tend to be a midfoot striker, and I was able to get a decent pop out of the shoe. Leaning more forward in them elevates that sensation and really maximizes the effect of the foam/plate combination.

My run today was a steady-state effort, and these shoes really allowed me to maintain momentum. I frequently was pulling back because my pace was pushing above the target without trying. Most of the other shoes I own don't tend to be this cajoling, and I am looking forward to seeing how they fare in a long-run scenario with marathon to half marathon pace efforts. I suspect these will even be decent for a 10K. 

The weight underfoot is well-controlled. Yes, they are noticeably heavier than my Metaspeed Sky Paris, but that's an unfair comparison to make. I consider them similar to the NB SC Elite v4 in terms of how the weight is managed. That said, these are more rewarding to push at speed. 

One area of concern that I had was the lateral side cutout. I find that at easier paces, the shoe is more unstable and leans a bit toward that. At speed, though, the cutout is not noticeable, and the shoe even handles tight corners relatively well. This was probably the biggest surprise to me. I liken it to a bicycle: stability improves with speed, and going slow means you're more likely to fall. 

Where do I see myself using these?

I don't see them being my go-to race day shoe. These would be great for long runs, especially with some efforts in there, as the foam really helps mitigate fatigue, and I was able to get into a flow state during my run today.

I could see myself using them in a wet race situation because the rubber coverage is good and a bit thicker than the MS Sky Paris, but that would probably me the only time I would find myself on the start line with them.

All-in-all, I am excited by these shoes. They're fun and a huge surprise. They're the first road Hokas I truly enjoy as opposed to tolerating. ",2024-05-10 22:25:03+00:00,79,28
1cotzui,FootFunction,Chronic insertional Achilles tendinopathy," Hi all. I have had a fair share of Achilles issues in the past few years but I would like to focus on my current situation. In December I was doing a lot of walking and woke up one morning with a pretty debilitating pain at the insertion. I immediately had serious trouble walking (limping constantly and couldnt walk more than 3000 steps a day.)

Over the course of a couple months it starting getting better. I was doing slow eccentric heel drops most days and walking more and more. I eventually was able to do approximately 10 sets of 10 1-leg heel drops. I was still in some pain especially after maybe a 10 min walk but in general it was managable. I think I overdid it and my heel came back with a vengeance. I (probably incrorrectly) tried to continue with my same heel drop regiment and i just went back to square 1.

I've been stuck in a lot of pain, only able to walk around 3000 steps a day for around 2 months now and I'm feeling really discouraged. I have read a lot of IAT success stories on here and [r/trainrunning](https://www.reddit.com/r/trainrunning/) but many of these cases are from people running marathons etc. I don't see many people who get IAT and have trouble going to the supermarket.

What I am doing now: I have tall heel lifts in my shoes, custom orthotics and only wear hokas. I foam roll my calf and foot every day and am trying to slowly ramp up my heel drops again. Yesterday I did approximately 100 2-foot heel drops and am feeling sore but not awful today.

I got an MRI last week and it showed ""mild achilles tendinosis at the insertion point"" Everything else was normal from my MRI. I don't have a visible bump and my heel is surprisingly not red or swollen.

I guess I am just looking for a little encouragement and advice from someone with a similar case. Do you think I should continue to limit walking and slowly increase my heel drops (optimistically returning to 1-leg heel drops and then weighted 1-leg heel drops?) I constantly feel like I'm overusing it but I use it so little.

Any advice (or success stories!) would be much appreciated. Thanks everyone!",2024-05-10 16:41:33+00:00,6,13

1coa310,trailrunning,Lone Peaks Sloppy?,"I bought a pair of Lone Peak 8s and really enjoyed my first time with them, did around 15 miles in the Catskills. The shoes are super comfortable and fun to use, I had little issues with them out of the box. However, the one problem I had was I felt the toe box was sloppy. When I would step perpendicularly on rocks, my forefoot would slide to the sides of the shoe and pinch into the fabric. This was super uncomfortable and a bit painful towards the end, it was essentially slightly rolling my ankle within the shoe repeatedly. I will further mention that I had no issues with the heel and the midfoot. Both of these felt locked and secure. Is this an issue where my feet are too narrow for lone peaks or is this a common problem?

  
I am considering switching to HOKA Speedgoats, which I found solved this problem perfectly as they had more lateral support in the forefoot (due to it being narrower). I was also looking into La Spotiva Bushidos but I have been unable to try them on. My concern is I'm unsure how comfortable these shoes will be over time because wearing those Altras was quite eye opening.

I am running into issues with my right ankle swelling and now I‚Äôm getting shin splints in both legs.

I‚Äôve been doing couch to 5k and redoing the days/ weeks until I feel comfortable 

I had someone tell me that the issue is my Hokas and they are waking shoes, not running shoes.

Is this true? Do I need to find another type of shoe? 

I also do 75 hard which is two workouts a day. I started walking as my workouts and I have walked 45-60 minutes every day almost twice a day for the past roughly 60 days and no feet pain

This last workout I had I tried to push my speed a bit and I unfortunately then had to step back to more speed walking. I now feel better and would like to get back to light jogging, but will Hokas impede my progress? I have the gaviota 4 and another pair not on my that I can remember. I mostly wear the gaviota 

TLDR- will Hokas hurt my running progress? Are they just a walking shoe? ",2024-05-08 21:18:00+00:00,3,24

# Past Marathons / Training

31M. 4th marathon. First one was almost 10 years ago in Pittsburgh (3:18) during med school, so I'm positive it was poor training, as I just ran for stress relief. Ran York, PA in 2022 (3:07) using the Run with Hal app. Tried PGH again in 2023, and ended up imploding in the back 9 (3:21), while training with a coach through our local Fleet Feet running group.

Goal coming in was a BQ (or at least a chance to apply, whatever), which I knew as going to be a tall task, given the huge PR needed and lost confidence from my previous race. Only change I made in my training from 2023 to 2024 was to actually push through pain on long runs / hills and not walk as often. I did between 38 to 58 miles / week during my 18 week block, usually in the mid 40s. I also was lifting consistently for the first 10 weeks. I did not have any midseason 1/2s and my only race was a St. Patrick's Day 4-miler (23:57).

I felt like I got super lucky with a golden training season overall though - no injuries or missed work outs. Going into taper and then the race, my body (and race mentality) were both in the best place they've been.

easy runs - Hoka Mach 5 and Nike Invincible 3

threshold / speed - Brooks Hyperion Tempo

race day - New Balance Fuelcell Supercomp Elite V3 (second race in these).

# Pre-race

Found out the week before the race that there would be no pacers for the the 3 hour group. This was a huge bummer for me, as I've found that I don't always have the mental stamina to keep focus for that long of time. I've always found running off of feel alone gets me in trouble very quickly.

Stayed in downtown Jim Thorpe for the race weekend. Very lovely town - just be aware, this is the end of the course, not the start. Also, if you have a dog that needs grass to go to the bathroom, don't stay in town (all gravel with very few public grassy places).

Previewed the first two miles of the course with my wife and dog the day before. This was extremely beneficial because I did not find the webstite to have explained the starting line very clearly. Could have just been me though.

Luckily, racers were very well organized and grouped themselves by pace (Facebook group a few days before the race), which great. Consensus was a 7:15 start time, which I didn't love, since I had to give up the train ride - but this was a small price to pay, and ended up being a blessing later on.

# Race

Honestly, not a lot to talk about for most of the race. Start was a little odd - out mile and back on a narrow portion of the trail, but not bad. Wore a garmin forerunner 955, which locked onto the pace pretty good for about 11 miles. Used race screen and a pacing tattoo after that to try to counteract the loss of service after that. Ambiance was relaxing with a lot of shade, lot of river noise (I don't listen to music), lots of packed gravel. Topography pretty much matched the description, constant slight down hill with only noticeable uphill at beginning.

Felt great coming through the half (1/2 PR - 1:27:51) while taking Roctane gu every 35 min and water every 45 min.

Still felt good until about 22. Hit some loose gravel around then and started losing shade as the sun/heat really started bearing down. Felt pretty mentally defeated coming through mile 24 and was just trying to not walk. Started losing the group I was with at this point despite their encouragement and from the people passing me.  Unfortunately, I forgot to take my last gu by this point and did not have any water available (felt like Roland Deschain chasing the Man in black across the Mohaine Desert). I stopped looking at any my watch after mile 25, because I knew if I saw I fell off of my B goal, I was going to have a tough time finding the motivation to keep running at all.

Was able to find a last burst after passing the mile 26 marker, but man, there was nothing left. Thought I was going to collapse afterwards. Luckily stopped my watch, but never looked at it.

# Post-race / Next Up

Decent set up with tents for food, water, shirts, etc... Medals were pretty nice too. Revived a little bit with congratulations from my wife and family / friends and then made my way to the official timing tent. Guy that printed my time looked like he didn't actually want to give it to me when he saw the time first - I think he could tell what my reaction was going to be.

I think I went through all 5 stages of grief over the next 10 minutes.

Slowly changed out my shoes and walked back to the Muggles Mug coffee shop (highly recommend, even if you're not a Potter head). Eventually did wrap my head around the PR and am pretty proud of my time. But those 11 seconds are haunting.

What's next?

Took a few days off to decide what to do next. Ultimately, the goal is the Boston, but will be happy with a sub-3.

But more than anything, looking for advice from you all: input, critiques, tips (besides run faster, dont forget gu).

Key questions:

-Thoughts on back to back Marathons to hit sub-3? Might try to sign up for presque isle and wine glass this fall, but not sure how feasible it is physically.

-Can I tell myself that I finally ran a sub-3 since every course is a little long based on USATF certification requirements? (this is purely for my ego, I know. Garmin did tell me 2:59:02)

1ckwrxg,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Mach 6 first run review,"Information about me - I am a high school XC - Track runner and I just picked up a pair of these for daily training purposes. My current rotation before this was, Speed 3s for daily running and tempo (I originally had a pair of Kinvara 14s for daily training but they were meh and made my feet numb) Adios 8 for track speed work, and Nimbus 26s for occasional recovery runs and daily walking. I felt like I needed a trainer since the speed 3s worked fine, but they made my legs more sore when running at daily/slower paces so I decided I needed to get a dedicated daily trainer. I got these yesterday at a local running store on a 10% discount for 126$ USD since I run for a local school, and I went for a 30 minute 4 mile run today to try them out.

The fit and specs- The Mach 6 has a 5 mm drop 37-32 and is pretty lightweight. The shoe fit true to size at 10.5 US men‚Äôs for me, and the fit was nice. No problems with the upper so far, seems pretty breathable and durable. It‚Äôs more snug than average, but I didn‚Äôt mind that.


The ride and how it felt - Overall I was very pleased with these shoes, they were responsive yet cushioned, and they felt great, not too soft and not too firm. The ride was nice and bouncy, I perfer it to the speed 3s bounce at daily pace and I really enjoyed running in these, I exceeded my normal paces by around 15 seconds per mile and my legs felt better than normal afterwards.

Concerns and how I will use them - These shoes will definitely be my go to daily trainer and I‚Äôll save the speeds for tempo and faster runs. I recommend this shoe for someone looking for a lightweight plateless daily trainer. My only concern is the midsole abrasion over time, which was a problem in my speeds on the sides, but I believe the midsole will hold up well. 

Conclusion - The Mach 6 is great trainer that I would reccomend. Excited to use these throughout XC and hope they last a while ",2024-05-05 17:41:33+00:00,88,41

1cjvng3,trailrunning,Best shoes for steep hills and rocky trails,"Hello everyone,

I watched a ton of youtube videos and read a good dozen if blog posts about best trail running boots.   
However, I still find it difficult to choose the best running shoe for me and our running conditions. 

Quick background: I run and hike in mountains area mostly (the Carpathians). Sometimes, paths look like on the photos attached. 

Therefore, I noticed two problems:  
1. A lot (!) of wet rocks. The shoes must have a good grip on those  
2. There are many steep climbs and downhills, so it's better for shoes to be 'roomy' in toes area. 

The last shoes I used to wear is On Cloudventure. Terrible experience, they got destroyed by the first sharp branch in a forest, and toenails are always damaged after wearing those. 

Need your advice: what would you consider the best shoes for such conditions? 

Currently looking at:  
- Hoka Mafate 4  
- Saucony Endorfins Rift  
- Nike Zegama 2 or Pegasus Trail 4

1cjdtho,FootFunction,"Ideas on how to accommodate foot injury from childhood (shoes, exercise,etc)","Hello, 
My 40M husband had a very traumatic foot injury at age 2 that had ultimately resulted in a huge chunk missing out of his ankle. He has had multiple surgeries and was able to lead a relatively normal childhood - even ran track in high school. 

There are pieces of bone missing but were covered (muscle flap transplantation and skin grafts) so he has full function in his foot, but he is SO hard on shoes. With the missing bone, it‚Äôs almost like he is ‚Äúdrilling a hole‚Äù through the heel of his shoes after 4-6 months. As we get older, the skin graft seems to be a lot more sensitive. 

Other than his primary care doctor, he hasn‚Äôt seen anyone for this for a very long time as it‚Äôs been mostly table, but recently started to have some issues with sensitivity on the skin. He has an appt to see a orthopedist (that specializes in podiatry) and we will of course ask for information and possible referrals/prescriptions for shoes as well as a long term plan for regular check-ins etc, but wondering if anyone has any ‚Äúreal world advice‚Äù to consider. 

As far as shoes, he was having luck with Hokas but something had changed and they don‚Äôt really work for him that well anymore (plus we really can‚Äôt be buying 2-3 pairs of super expensive shoes every year). He recently discovered that OluKai makes sneakers with heels that can fold down - which will be great as long as they don‚Äôt irritate the graft, but it‚Äôs kind of back to the same problem with just frequently replacing expensive shoes. He has also tried custom orthotic inserts a long time ago, and could maybe try them again, but they don‚Äôt really address the skin graft issue. 

Probably a long shot, but has anyone heard of custom shoemakers that work with people like him? Or even just give me ideas on other resources that would be good to ask?

Ad far as more general lifestyle questions, I‚Äôm not sure what to search for or what communities might be good for him/us to join. I found a couple of great videos in this group for workout videos - which is fantastic.

The route for both was an out and back and exactly the same with the exception at the end near my house running up and down the block to finish the time. I was dressed exactly the same as well with the exception of my shirt.

Take what you want from the data. Most of it is fairly small but in a marathon it can make a difference.  The biggest thing I took away was how much lower my HR was during the cooldown.

Alphafly are way bouncier than the Vaporfly. As many have said on this sub, the AF3 is the closest to the AF1 there is. I am a big fan of the Vaporfly but will run my marathon in 2 weeks in the AF3.

The AF3 is super loud.  Almost annoyingly loud. They are super comfortable though. I had 2 pairs of AF1s and both rubbed my heal raw the first run. The AF3 did not do this and fit extremely well. I felt like I could have held this pace much longer in the AF when compared to the VF. Legs felt fine this morning(Friday, May 3rd). It just so happened that today was a planned rest day.  I probably won't run in the AF before the marathon but will use the VF for an interval work out next week.

Based on the graph I was more conisent with my pacing in the VF which I found interesting.

When technical, the trails I run are roots and rocks, more so roots than rocks. On my last upgrade, I bought both Saucony Peregrine 12s and Salomon Sense Ride 4s, fully expecting to opt for the Peregrines. To my surprise, I much preferred the Sense Rides. I recently tested again to reconfirm my original assessment.

Maybe I'm a total noob, but while I can feel the Peregrines are a good shoe, they flex too much over the roots I'm running? I think I prefer the stability of the Sense Rides? Or less trail feel maybe? Anyone with insight here, please enlighten me.

In any case, I'm thinking about what's next. I figure to start with Salomon, seeing as how well I've gotten on with the Sense Rides, but thinking I'm looking for something that feels a little faster with as much or more stability. I've been eyeing the S/Lab Ultra 3, but not sure I can even find those anywhere to try on - or if that's just a big jump. Having started with Hoka Challenger ATRs, I appreciated the decrease in stack height from those to the Sense Rides, so not sure I want to trend the other way, but open to input.

1ch4c19,sesamoid,Cab you live with a fracture?,"Thank you everyone for sharing all of your stories and advice here - it's really helped me a lot already on this unexpected journey. 

TLDR: Has anyone lived with a non union fracture? It is possible to return to activities?

I'm a 39F and around 4 months ago I was extremely active over the Australian summer (pilates, pickleball, surfing etc). I started to get pain in my foot which has happened mildly in the past so I pushed through for 1 month. After that I could barely stand I was in so much pain so I went to a podiatrist. An Xray revealed a stress fracture. I wish the podiatrist had given me the type of information I've read here because he basically just put me in a moonboot and told me to wear it for 6 weeks and then I'd be fine.
 
After 10 weeks in the moon boot I was still in pain so my GP and PT suggested a new Xray. The attached image is this newer Xray which two doctors have said is a non union fracture. They said it probably won't ever heal. 

This week I saw a foot orthopaedic surgeon. He confirmed the same and said the only way to deal with it surgically was removal. He seemed to know a lot about this thankfully but he said he would rather not and warned me of the risks of the surgery. He referred me to his preferred Podiatrist for one last attempt at rehab. 

The new podiatrist attached a orthotic sponge to the sole of my foot, relieving pressure from the sesamoid. He told me to go for a long walk in my moon boot each day. Day 1 I realised that the orthotic relieved a lot of the pain but my knee pain got unbearable which he said was due to my slight adjustment in walking and the weight of the boot. He said I had passed the first test (painfree walking) and so day 2 he has me in the orthotic in my HOKAs (regular shoes). The pain is around 3/10 when I walk and mostly bearable but after a while my limping gets worse and at the end of the day it's quite achey. 

Part of me is just so relieved to be out of the boot (as we all know that can be a huge mental challenge) but then I'm also worried that walking on it now is going to cause more damage or that the pain will never go away. I'm also so impatient so I wonder if I'm just delayed the inevitable with the surgery and if it would be better to already be into that recovery process. 

Has anyone had a similar experience and been able to successfully rehab to live with this type of fracture? I'd love to hear as my surgeon has said to make a decision in three weeks after attempting this escalated rehab with my PT and Podiatrist. 

Thank you all ",2024-04-30 21:26:58+00:00,5,8
1cgnnce,Marathon_Training,Looking for Shin Splint Cause,"Hello friends,

Unfortunately, since last Wednesday, I have developed shin splints. Since then, I've of course stopped running and am now almost fit again after a lot of icing, stretching, strengthening, and massaging, so I can soon start running again. With my first marathon only a month away, I naturally want to prevent a recurrence and was wondering what you think the reason for my shin splints could be. I have three ideas:

1. Incorrect running form: I tend to land further back on my heel, which of course means more stress for the knees, etc. Additionally, I weigh 82 kg, which certainly doesn't help. Attached is a video taken after about 20 km. [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DwS0oIc6oQD8M4zU\_vLCsQJyRA9\_J\_S4/view?usp=drive\_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DwS0oIc6oQD8M4zU_vLCsQJyRA9_J_S4/view?usp=drive_link)
2. Volume increased too quickly: Here's the progression over the last few weeks: 55 km, 40 km, 51 km, 43 km, 77 km (last week after which the shin splints occurred), and in the week with 77 km, I also had my longest run so far (30 km, before that the longest was 26 km).
3. New shoes: In the video, I'm wearing the New Balance Fresh Foam X 1080v13, which I've been alternating with my Hoka Clifton 9 since the beginning of the 77 km week. I hope it's not because of them, as the shoes have always felt very good.

Thanks in advance for all responses, and if anything is unclear, I'm happy to add more details.",2024-04-30 08:19:19+00:00,1,1

1cgjj6m,PlantarFasciitis,"Thinking of going to a new podiatrist, wanted to ask some questions before I go.","I went to a podiatrist who told me I had plantar fasciitis. Now I don't know how it is diagnosed, but I told her I had foot pain. She asked me what shoes I was wearing, she checked if I had a broken bone, and then she told me it was plantar fasciitis. She gave me a huge insole which I think hurt me more than anything. I've since bought different insoles. 

I don't think she did much to check. I want to go over what I am experiencing to see if the issue is something else. It's possible the issue is tight shoes. I don't really know. I do wake up with some foot pain, but it's not that bad. I do the stretches but it does not seem to provide any relief, which tells me I am not stretching the part that is hurt or bruised. I believe the shoes are hurting me more than helping me. When I walk in shoes it feels like the inside of my feet are not flat against the bottom of my shoes. As in maybe my feet are being scrunched in the shoe? I don't know what a comfortable shoe would feel like I guess? How do I tell what a comfortable shoe is?

Is there a doctor I can go to who can tell me what my feet are like? I was expecting this doctor to, you know, have me stand on a machine or in some foam or something. Tell me how my feet sit on the ground or something. My feet feel bruised, which is different from the plantar fascitis pain which I have felt which has for the most part resolved. This doctor gave me compounding pharmaceutical rub which was supposed to ""reduce swelling"" to let my feet heal. 

I don't have much faith in that doctor. I have a new doctor I would like to go see, but I don't have the funds to keep seeing doctors randomly. If there's anything else I can do before seeing a doctor I'd like to try it. I can't keep hurting my feet. If a Wide Hoka isn't wide enough, I can try a Brooks or another Altra. But the Altras I own I went walking in and my feet went numb. 

SOMETHING is going on. I don't know what it is. But I want to get my thoughts together so when I do go to a doctor I get them on the right path. Because doctors are happy to go in any directions and collect their check. Please, any advice is helpful.",2024-04-30 03:59:37+00:00,4,18
1cgjfpv,RunningShoeGeeks,Altra Experience Flow - First Run Review,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dmguaty4ijxc1.jpg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49b6756f598a85df5c1ef9fca1d81089cfa888cf

For those who aren't aware - the Experience Flow is the V2 of the Altra FWD experience.  I haven't owned that shoe so I can't comment on how this version has changed, but I can give some observations from also actively using another Altra with a similar stack height in the Torin 7.

I've seen Altra officially announce this shoe was releasing on May 1st, and it hasn't even been listed in Fleet Feet where I usually buy my shoes, so I was quite surprised to see on a trip to REI that they had this model literally on display this weekend, and I ended up walking out with a pair of my own.  I've been wanting to transition to shoes with Altra's anatomic toe box and low to zero drop (before you suggest Topo, I tried them as well and they are too narrow in the midfoot for me).  I actually did fine in the Paradigm 7 that I had to end up returning as my extremely flat feet are sensitive to large sidewalls (I enjoyed the run in them but had horrible blisters afterwards), but have been having trouble starting to run in the Torin 7 even after weeks of walking, which I am thinking is more from the lack of a noticeable rocker (especially with the heavily rockered Guide 17 being my main mileage shoe thus far in 2024).  So I was quite intrigued by an Altra shoe whose whole premise was being rockered (not sure if I needed the 4mm drop with the rocker already taking the edge off my foot muscles, but that should make it an even ""safer"" choice for me and others).

Personal Experience:

So thus far after a day and a half I have a 4 mile run and 2 mile walk in these.  These have interacted with my biomechanics in an interesting way.  In my 6mm Guide 17s, I land in my midfoot to heel (with the heel still regardless absorbing a noticeable amount of impact), but my 0mm drop Torin 7s have gotten me to a strike closer to the forefoot.  Even with a 4mm drop, I've still felt the impact largely on my forefoot in these, granted just in running in not walking.  While a forefoot landing was one of the reasons I tried to transition to the Torin 7, I found that, at least with the current strength of my foot muscles, this type of landing and stride irritated my plantar fascia with an ""over-stretch"" type of feeling.  However, in the Flow, despite also landing in the forefoot, my plantar fascia felt completely fine.  I attribute this to the rocker design, and while I did not feel the massive heel bevel due to a forefoot landing, I did feel the toe spring.  If there is any complaint I would have with it, after wearing them for a full work day after my run, I felt slight fatigue in my big toe, possibly from being propped up by the toe spring.  I also had some very mild soreness in my metatarsal area that quickly subsided, which may be because I'm not super used to forefoot landings in running.

Fit:

I've heard that the FWD Experience is a low volume ""performance"" fit, despite being listed as a standard foot shape shoe by Altra.  I actually did not personally feel that in the Flow.  While I haven't owned the FWD Experience, I can say this was a much higher volume fit than the Torin 7 (which I got in the same Men's 10.5).  Outside of the heel (which I'll talk about shortly), I actually thought this was a looser fit, and was definitely looser than my Torin 7 (again, except for the heel).  The toebox in the Torin 7 is actually quite low volume, with a pretty low height and inflexible upper.  The height is noticeably higher volume in the Flow and the upper has some flexibility, though not super stretchy like my Guide 17s.  Though I feel like the toebox width may not be enough to satisfy some Altra fans.  The midfoot width feels average in these shoes, which is something to point out because there have been some ""standard"" fit Altras that had strangely narrow midfoots in the past few years.  What really surprised me first putting these on where two huge bump-like pieces of padding inside the heel, in the at the back of the ankle bone.  This felt extremely odd at first, as it was something I had not experienced before, but as someone with narrow heels that always has to lace lock, I grew to enjoy the additional security it provides in the heel area, and I had no slippage in this shoe.  I had feared with the ankle contact that this prominent area of padding that this could cause blisters or irritation, but I have not experienced much friction yet, and think that is unlikely as a result, though time will tell for sure.  There is no gusseted tounge but I barely noticed and had no issues with lockdown.  The heel counter here feels \*mostly\* non-rigid.

Foam/Performance/Versatility:

And of course there is the CMEVA foam. Not surprisingly, this is not the way to go for someone looking for a ""cushy"" shoe. I'm certainly not that person, as my knees/IT band don't react well to shoes with that soft, sinking, feeling, though I can enjoy some cushioning from somewhat firm foams, like the Ego Max in the Torin 7 (which is actually a good bit foam).  The foam here feels more firm and a good bit less cushioned than the Torin 7's EGO Max despite a similar stack height (that does give you some ground feel though, but nothing like an Escalante).  The foam is thankfully not ""dead foam"" (which I might use to describe the Hoka Arahis that I wore for several generations) and has some bounce to it, but not a ton, and far from the amount of bounce possible in a non-racing daily trainer, as I would say the PWRRUN+ Ride 17 are a significantly bouncier ride than this.

I tried some short strides, and it does feel like these shoes can get snappy and the foam a bit more responsive running faster in these.  The shoe still lacked a real pop to them, but it felt like my posterior chain was turning over nicely with the rockered experience.  I also appreciated the heel padding here, as my narrow heels can cause some additional slippage at higher speeds.  I do really need some more time and some workouts in these before I can say much about the performance, but it clearly was not getting in the way for some initial work.  The shoes are listed at 8.4oz by Altra (not sure what size, Men's 9?) which seems quite light for this segment.  They did not feel heavy by any means, but they also did not feel especially light for a daily trainer like the measurements would suggest.

With an aggressive rocker, there is the concern that this is an unpleasant shoe to stand, walk, or run at slower paces in, which I've heard about the FWD experience before.  I actually did not really experience this personally (having done a recovery run, walk, and work day in these), and I felt like the rocker was even less intrusive to those activities than the one in my Guide 17s.  Your experience might vary on this though, and my forefoot landings may have led me to bypass the massive heel bevel that would cause this feeling.

Stability:

While there is a stability version in the 4mm rockered Experience line now, I still want to talk about stability in this shoe.  I have for most of my running career run with stability shoes, but I am trying to get away from them because my extremely flat feet are very senstive to both side walls/guide rails and medial posts, and I only need a slight amount of stability (which I've found could be provided by certain neutral shoes, and the idea here is that a rocker provides this stability, along with some mild sidewalls closer to the rear of the shoe).  My right foot which can have overpronation issues in some (but certainly not all) neutral shoes had a small amount of strain stabilizing in my first run, but it was far from major.  I'd say my right foot felt more stable than the Ghost Max, which Doctors of Running classifies as a ""stable neutral"" shoe.

I also react better stability-wise to stiffness in the forefoot, and I'd say these shoes are average in that department, unlike the Torin 7's which are very still in that area.

Conclusion:

So overall, this was an intriguing first run in a new highly rockered Altra shoe.  I've actually not experienced a lot of the complaints that some have had with the original FWD Experience, but I'm not sure if that's due to changes in the shoe or how I work in them.  This is also a much easier shoe to transition to than Altra's zero drop lineup.  I am quite eager to put more miles in them and am looking to make this the main shoe in my rotation if things continue to go well.",2024-04-30 03:54:06+00:00,29,22

1cfuqu4,Marathon_Training,marathon training/racing shoes,"advice on marathon training/racing shoes

hi guys! i am just about to start my first ever marathon training plan (yay!). My local shoe store currently has 20% off of all their running shoes (plus have a coupon and i can combine the two). this means that now would be the perfect time to splurge on a good quality pair of running shoes! 

i am looking for shoes that i can do some of my distance training in but ideally also race the actual marathon in. i have struggled with ankle pain in the past and so cushioning is more important to me than having a faster but hard shoe (that being said i am not against carbon plates, as long as the shoe is cushioned enough to not make the carbon plates to hard on the feet). I also found the hoka bondi 8 a bit too cushioned and felt slow in them. I have done a gait analysis before and i don‚Äôt need a support shoe:)

my go to everyday shoe are the triumph 20s and i absolutely adore them! for reference: i just ran a half marathon in 1h56min in them so im very much an average runner pace-wise


here were some ideas i had:

new balance: 1080 or super comp (only concern would be the carbon plate making these hard?)

asics: superblast or novablast (is the price difference worth it?)

on: cloudmonster

hoka: cielo x1 (same concern as with the sc)

any advice/ideas/suggestions would be greatly appreciatedüòä! I will of course also ask the worker at the store for advice when i go but i am just super excited and wanted to so a bit of research on my own :)

1cdxhxu,RunningShoeGeeks,Altra escalante racer and reebok floatzig 1 intial thoughts,"Hi All

Haven't seen these spoken about much so thought I'd share my experience with both pairs.

Context: heavier and newish runner, 6.1ft and 105kg. Generally run up to 15km and not particularly fast. Altras in 12 and floatzig in 12.55

Other shoes: Brooks hyperion tempos (retired), saucony ep 3 for race day, saucony es 3 for general use and Adidas takumi sen 9s for intervals.

Altra ER

I purchases these to mix into my rotation, I wanted zero drop and less cushion to strengthen weaker bits of my legs.

Upper is fantastic in anything but rain. It's almost a knit Upper, super light, roomy toebox and flex. I get a good lockdown but still roomy.

Midsole is not very exciting, very firm and not much of it. You get good ground feedback and some protection.

Grip is great and haven't had any slips. The wide base also makes it very stable.

Overall I like them and use them for general walking around, in the gym for mixed workouts and rotate them in for the odd 5km to 10km. I've got about 20km in them and my first 5km was brutal on the calves.

Floatzig 1

Purchased these as I've been searching for a daily trainer. Tried the Brooks ghost max and didn't like them. I have wide feet so looked at a few options but sizing didn't work. Also tried some hoka rincon 3s but didn't like them either.

Upper on this shoe is great, feels flexible but with some structure to it. The toebox is roomy, I did get a little bit of heel slip but marathon loop solved that. I also really like the look of these shoes.

Midsole is squishy but firms up on the run. Not much energy return but for the purposes of a more recovery/zone 2 type shoe, it works well. Midsole is a fraction narrow I felt.

Grip was OK for me, ran on some damp pavement and could feel the grip was sufficient but not much more.

Overall these fit the daily trainer feeling I was going for, price point is decent as well. They feel well built and felt relatively light on the foot. I picked up the pace a few times on recovery runs and they can do that as well. I've run about 12km on them so far.

Two very different shoes, altras are a bit of a niche category but I'd like to try the vanish 2 race shoes. Reeboks are great looking and do the job but you can find more dynamic dailies I feel.",2024-04-26 21:42:46+00:00,20,23

I did the first section in Hoka Speedgoat 5s, and my feet were destroyed by the toe box after a few days.  Since then, I've tried some Salomons and other Hokas but can't seem to find the right shoe.

1cdrnk7,walking,Another shoe question ,"Hi all! Just realized how much my current walking shoes (Hoka Mach 5 I believe) are worn out so it‚Äôs time to look into getting a new pair. I got these gently used and they were my first pair of athletic sneakers so I have nothing to compare to. 

About me:

I go for a 3 mile walk with my dog on terrain that is paved, gravel, and compacted dirt/sand. It‚Äôs a mix of flat and hills. 

I have high arches (determined by a foot scan some years ago) and prefer a roomier toe box but not quite to the ‚Äúbarefoot‚Äù shoe territory. 

I‚Äôm only 25 but have suffered joint pain my entire life so good support is helpful 

I do wear them out and about for errands so something marginally good looking is a bonus but not a priority 

Thinking about maybe getting a new pair of Mach 5s but I also wanted to ask people who actually know about shoes. Ideally I‚Äôd like to spend under $150 so I know I won‚Äôt be getting the best of the best but since I‚Äôm not doing serious mileage that‚Äôs fine! Thanks!",2024-04-26 17:44:06+00:00,2,4
1cdej7t,RunningShoeGeeks,ON Cloudeclipse Review,"The heavily acclaimed ON Cloudeclipse was my choice for a daily trainer/long run shoe leading into my first marathon I just completed 5 days ago. So far I have 235km on them.

I‚Äôm 24, an experienced runner with a Half Marathon PB of 1:19 and 5km of 17:01, both set in 2018, and had about 4 years off before coming back mid last year. I wear a size 10US D width, mild pronation, but have always stayed in neutral but stable shoes while focusing on strength to keep things natural Weigh 85KG (about 3 weeks ago?) and I‚Äôm 178CM tall. Current 5km is about 20:10 and finished my first marathon in 3:50 5 days ago, I‚Äôll get into that further‚Ä¶

These aren‚Äôt my first pair of ON‚Äôs but since coming back to running I‚Äôve focused more on what I actually like, back then I‚Äôd just low through shoes in about 4 months so nothing concerned me too much.

Initially these were very cushioned and felt like they had an excellent rocker around the toes when I tried on in store, they continued this way for the first 100km or so, and since then they‚Äôve just fallen off horribly.

To start they were springy, cushioned, but firm as ON always are, not soft with a nice insole that was very plush. Perfect for cruising at about 5min/km

I‚Äôve done some speed sessions, easy runs up to 12km and all my long runs as well as the marathon itself in these.

The toe box is roomy to say the least, and can‚Äôt really be locked down with the lacing ON use, but not too big of an issue, the rocker is definitely there as well, quite noticeable.

The midsole is where things fall far, the cushioning is rock solid as you wear the shoes more, on long long runs it‚Äôs quite nasty on the feet and knees and the speed board isn‚Äôt actually that stable or responsive, leading the shoe to feel rather dead, like wood under the feet. 

The heel is just fine, easy enough to stay locked in without any different lacing, and I personally like how the heel isn‚Äôt very padded, keeps it light and cool especially in Australian heat. And the sole is rather soft here where the main stack is, and is the better part of the shoe.

The upper is durable, feels nice but struggles to lock in fully due to the lacing style they use, mainly around the toes, but that‚Äôs minor.

Overall it‚Äôs a 6.5/10, looking forward to getting a new trainer sooner than I expected and change it out.

My Marathon attempt: 
First 21km was torrential rain, not many shoes are built for that surprise when it was supposed to be clear. However after only 2km the insole of my right foot started rolling up the foot and curling under my toes, which also created a small but very noticeable gap my toes were falling into, slipping up the heel! (Visible in second pic) Very strange and I‚Äôve never had this before, and not on any runs in the rain with these until the event. I kept a stable 4:55 min/km pace until 26km where my knees basically crumbled and feet ached horribly from the shoes. The cushioning is unforgiving over distance, and far to firm for me, it‚Äôs deceptive on most runs but once you get that far with a solid attempt at a run they just fall apart. 

I should have opted for a race shoe instead of playing it safe which backfired (yes my fitness wasn‚Äôt perfect and my training neither, but it really highlighted the shoes issues during the race)

I‚Äôd highly recommend a Hoka Clifton, ASICS Nimbus or NB 1080 over these any day of the week for a max cushioned experience.

With glowing memories of LP5s and 6s I ordered a pair of LP8s with fingers crossed.  Crossing fingers didn't work.  I returned them immediately.

I reasoned that 4mm of drop would not be a drastic change and that my lingering pissed off S/I joint might benefit from a thicker, more cushioned midsole.  With this in mind I bought a pair of Hoka Mafate Speed 4s.  The first time out reminded me of the first time I laid down on a memory foam mattress.  Unbelievably comfortable.

Second run the comfort still dominates but from that comfort I became aware of something missing.  I can best describe it, for the guys anyway, as wearing an extremely comfortable but thick condom.  I had no idea how much I enjoyed feeling the trail.

I'm going to stick with the Mafates until my S/I joint heals completely but I'd like to ask for suggestions on good choices for shoes that are more nimble and sensitive to the trail.

I'm game for anything with 5mm of drop or less and with at least as much toe room as the Mafates.  I've tried Topo's MNT Racer 3 and the Pursuit.  I found them to be good shoes, just more stiff and boot like.  Something more supple than those is what I'm looking for.  TIA",2024-04-22 22:29:39+00:00,0,12

1cah9c3,CaminoDeSantiago,Lessons learnt from Tui - Santiago de Compostela,"I (F32) only had a short space of time so decided to do the Tui - Santiago route on the central Portuguese way. Got extremely lucky with the weather (25-27C each day and cloudless) and thought sharing my experience might be helpful :). Apologies as a Scot that I work in miles!

I did day 1 (Tui to Redondela, 20 miles), day 2 (redondela - Pontevedra, 12 miles), day 3 (Pontevedra - Caldas des Reis, 13 miles) and day 4 (Caldas des Reis - Santiago de Compostela, 27 miles.)

1. I flew into Vigo airport which is only a 20 minute taxi to Tui. I know a lot of people fly into Santiago and take the bus, but if you live in a city that flies into Vigo this is another option (I am flying back from Santiago.)

2. Appreciating that it will be different in summer, if doing at this time of year and you (like me) want to mostly walk alone, leave either at 7am ish or post 10am from main hubs. 0830-0930 is rush hour and on day 2 and 3 I spent the first hour overtaking everyone. 

3. even if you are not religious, be prepared for a lot of emotion outside the cathedral de Santiago! 
4. To be safe on roads - WALK ON THE LEFT against oncoming traffic, unless it is a tight bend where you are in a blind spot, in which case walk on the right 
5. Day 3 between Pontevedra and caldas des Reis - you will come to a very busy cafe which is like Times Square. Ignore it and keep going - 15 minutes down the road there is a lovely quiet cafe with tables under trees which gives free cake with coffee. Likewise, further on, there is a lovely restaurant called oasis which does the most fabulous food and serves tinto de verrano in a jug with a bowl. Order the ‚Äùchorizo o inferno‚Äù and you can get your own spit with chorizo sausage 
6. Tinto de verrano is more common than sangria - it‚Äôs basically the same minus the fruit (lemonade and red wine, it‚Äôs weak and diluted, fine to drink like a soft drink!)
7. The wine in this region is weak and therefore you can drink the jug you‚Äôre served at lunch, don‚Äôt worry!
8. Spend the money (eg ¬£20 a pair) on merino ultra lite socks. Your feet will thank you
9. I‚Äôm glad I listened to advice on Reddit and bought a pair of Hokas. I would have died in my lightweight hiking boots 
10. My fourth day I combined the recommended two days (caldas des Reis - Padron and padron - Santiago de Compostela.) with the caveat that I am fit and walk a lot, I‚Äôm glad I did as padron was fairly uninspiring. If you can‚Äôt walk 25+ miles in one day, I‚Äôd recommend booking accommodation before or after Padron. Also, the 11 miles from Caldas des Reis to Padron felt very short and for me, wouldn‚Äôt have felt like enough walking for one day.
11. Redondela, Pontevedra and Caldas des Reis are all lovely towns if you want a day off 
12. If you‚Äôre worried about money - order the drinks! You almost always get the free pinxtos (tapas) with your ‚Ç¨2 glass of wine which fills you up 
13. Don‚Äôt be like the fellow walkers I saw and pick fruit - those are people‚Äôs crops. In high season 3000 peregrines can pass through a day, don‚Äôt be that person!
14. The last leg (Padron to Santiago) has limited obvious places to eat (at least in April)
15. Wear shorts with pockets! For your phone 
16. Compeed does a great stick for rubbing on ankles etc to avoid blisters 
17. Don‚Äôt wear cotton. It will get gross and grubby. Wear active wear.
18. Pack a very lightweight dress (if you wear dresses!), it is lovely to have something fresh to wear out in evenings. Especially Pontevedra and Santiago which are bigger and have nicer bars / restaurants 
19. Bring a tiny shall (that can fit in a pouch) to wear over your shoulders into cathedrals and churches if you are walking in sleeveless tops. 
20. My fluent-in-Spanish brother told me (so apologies if this is wrong!) that in informal places, ‚Äùtomo‚Äù is fine, in more formal places (eg restaurants) say ‚Äùquisiera.‚Äù Any native Spanish speakers please correct me! (Coming from a bilingual English French person who always errs on side of being too polite in French.) 
21. If you‚Äôre a woman with a bigger chest, I‚Äôd still opt for a tight fitting, non wired sports bra if you can with a top over it. You don‚Äôt need impact support, it is a mostly flat trail. Will be much more comfortable in the heat than a wired bra.

That‚Äôs mostly everything that comes to mind - more than happy to give recommendations on places to eat, kit, fitness level etc!

I've tried different types of socks, tried loosening the laces on my shoes and nothing seems to really help it. When I notice it, I've started putting my weight towards the inside of my foot, which does help, but I don't want to mess up my hips or back with a weird gait. 
Taking a break does seem to help so I can finish my walk. We have a park in my neighborhood and I enjoy swinging (yes, I'm a child at heart) as kind of a reward for getting my miles in and that little break really does the trick for getting rid of the pain and tingling. 
Has anyone else experienced this? If it was both feet, I'd be more inclined to say it was my shoes, but they are otherwise very comfy, and I have no issue with my right foot, which is, oddly the slightly larger foot. 
I'm considering contacting a podiatrist, but just wanted to see if anyone here has any thoughts? ",2024-04-22 13:13:23+00:00,3,6

1c9vx06,RunningShoeGeeks,New Balance Rebel v4,"About me:
- just getting back into running after a long break
- 5‚Äô0‚Äù
- about 150lbs
- slow runner, my pace is usually mid 8 to mid 9 minutes per km
- Morton‚Äôs toe
- Achilles tendinopathy 

First run:
- 3kms 
- 8:16/km average pace
- 5 minutes run, 1 minute walk 

I used to run several times a week, but had emergency surgery, life got busy, I started doing other forms of physical activity and got away from it. Now that the weather is nice I wanted to work running back into my routine. My previous shoes were dead, so I looked for something different. Initially planned on Hoka Cliftons but the heel shape bothered by Achilles tendon something fierce. 

I took the Rebels out for the first time today and these were great! Felt extremely stable, wide enough in the forefoot, and no issues with my long toes. I had no heel slipping at all and no hot spots at the end of the run. The shape of the heel didn‚Äôt bother my Achilles at all, which was lovely. Even using the walk/run sequence my overall pace was faster than usual. These are fab!

1c9sz5q,RunningShoeGeeks,Skyward X - 20 Mile Review,"I recently had to replace my Mach X running shoes. I suffered from plantar fasciitis a few years ago, and I found that Hoka shoes were the only ones that provided relief and eventually eliminated my foot pain. Last year, I bought the Mach X/Rocket X2 combo. I had a decent year running with both shoes, even achieving a personal best of 1:35 in a half marathon. I am hoping to achieve a sub 1:30 in the Rockets next weekend.

The Mach Xs were my daily trainers, and they served me well. Instead of buying another pair, I decided to try the Skyward X as an alternative daily trainer to the Mach X. Knowing about the Hoka's 30-day return policy, I thought I'd give the Skyward a shot. 

I have put 20 miles on the Skyward X since I bought them. I did a 12-mile run at half marathon pace and a couple of base runs. Although they are heavier than most shoes, the weight distribution is fantastic, and you hardly notice the difference in weight. They are not heavy. These shoes are stable, and the energy return is unlike anything I have experienced before. They are just fun and a great training shoe. They work perfectly at a pace of 4:00km. They are not meant to be speed shoes, but they are capable of speed due to the rocker and carbon plate.

The fit is excellent, and the shoes are very well made, especially the upper. They seem like they will be durable. As someone who has had injuries and foot pain in the past, I highly recommend the Skyward X so far.",2024-04-21 21:16:54+00:00,46,36
1c9ppp2,CaminoDeSantiago,Shoes for a flat footer on the Camino Frances?,"Hi all, a bit of background and I'm looking for opinions from fellow low archers or those who suffer from plantar fasciitis (I'm unfortunately both).

First, I'm a very experienced hiker and have done many multi day hikes including the Camino Frances from Ponferrada to Santiago DC.  In all of those hikes, I've used hiking boots.  They were great but of course they were heavy and for our upcoming 800km Camino, Ive been convinced I want trail runners instead.  Now, yesterday I bought the Hoka Bondi 8s.  Love the arch support, but I'm a bit put off at their seemingly flimsy nature and very runner-esque sole...very flat with no real tread/cleating and are not vibram.  I'm worried they won't hold up, nor will they be appropriate tread for some terrain.

TL;DR - I'm a flat footed, plantar fasciitis suffering, old experienced hiker looking for alternatives to hiking boots and don't think the Hoka Bondi is quite the solution.  Looking for thoughts and alternatives from you lovely people.",2024-04-21 19:01:09+00:00,1,8

**Positives:**

* Easy Bounce
* Smooooooth
* Locked in
* For the Sunday Runner - Quick

**Negatives:**

* Colorway is a bit Macleans Toothpaste

**Overview:**

Hello, ill get into it quick, went out and did a 5k upon getting these. For the last year ive gone from someone who ran 5k at around 4:25 - 4:40 per km all the time (3 or 4 years of running), to not being able to get under 5:10 per km. Thats the result of a couple of surgeries and a couple of covids etc, but its been frustrating. The 5km in these felt quicker than usual right away, not like i was sprinting but more like that the same amount of effort i was putting in, i was getting moved along pleasantly. Not unhinged, legs going all over the show, lungs battling to keep up with my legs, but more just a smooth turnover, nice ""easy"" bounce/push forward, but quicker than i had been moving in other shoes over the last 12months. I noticed the underfoot isn't pillowy soft but more like spring soft, not super firm or uncomfortable (like the Superblast), but honestly like there were little 1 inch bounce boards in the sole, where you don't sink so far down in it, you more hit the Carbon Plate and it pops you back, but in a way where you feel like its still you doing the work. I was pleasantly surprised when id finished, looked at my Strava and had done a 23:20 5k.  
Next day i went out for 8k at a slower speed with a Runclub and again, i was moving a lot quicker than usual for the group, i was being told to slow down by my mate i was running with. At the slower speed, the bounce was still there but i also noticed a little bit more suppleness/softness. Again, not yuck and mushy where there was no return but nicely where it felt like you still had Energy and pop, but also gentle on your legs, not painful on your arches/bottom of foot area, no harshness what so ever. The ability for this shoe to roll through and not be like a 5 year old on raspberry fizz considering the pop/bounce you get is the goldilocks combo that ive been looking for personally.  
Now onto the overall things I've picked up from both Runs and ill break them down into things I've looked for into shoes I've had gone by:

Stability - yep its there, i don't need a stability shoe but i do over pronate a little bit, more heel and a little midfoot but I've had to get rid of the Endo Speed 1, the Prime X Strung 2, even the Triumph 21 was a little hairy in the heel for me. This is fine, im not noticing ANYTHING to worry about here, and i'd  know about it after a run on the inside of my ankles/shins if there was. That was the first thing i was worried about with these due to the stack but if anything, the heel when standing in them flat, tends to roll outward ever so slightly. So very happy in that regard.

Weight - this is a non event, honestly. People complaining about the weight of this or saying its heavy, its like saying Sydney Sweeney is ugly compared to Margot Robbie. Ive had the Triumph 21, the Invincible 2 and 3, the Endo Shift 1, the Novablast 4, the Glideride 1, the Prime X Strung 2, Superblast. Realistically, i could not tell the difference at all between these and any of the others. Granted I'm not pb'ing every run i do but for most of us here, your not either, otherwise you wouldn't be on Reddit, you'd be out training.

Stack and Drop - my calves can give me a little grief if the drop is too low, Endo Shift 1's had a 4mm Drop and they gave me trouble in the first 1 - 2km of every run. These here with their 5mm drop, even though its only 1mm more than the Shift, ive not had a glimmer of pain or calf niggle. I think the rocker here helps and you roll through the stride without getting caught in the midfoot or at the toes too, its fun landing and being able to use the whole of the outsole to roll through on and push off. The Stack height is cool too, i hate feeling the harshness of the road under your feet, here its all cushion, not super stiff though either, theres a little bit of flex which is really pleasant, considering it has the plate and such a monster of foam. I disliked the Superblast as it was a stiff heap and it was superfirm. This isnt even close to that level of stiffness, there is enough compliancy to make to make you feel safe, supported, locked in and stable, but also not like the shoe is going to lose any integrity for a very long time. So nice having a decent amount of stack under the balls of the foot/toes too that isn't super super stiff. The one thing i felt the Invincible series lacks is that so this here has made me very happy.

Upper - Locked in. Not sloppy, not tight, not flimsy, just right. Narrows the smallest smallest amount through the arch/midfoot compared to the heel and forefoot but not in a bad or uncomfortable way, but more in a way you feel when you put a seatbelt on in a car, id describe it as cared for. Also true to size in my US10.5 Mens. Nice amount of room width ways and length ways and i have a wider than average but not wide foot. 

Midsole - yep, as you've guessed i like it, it feels energetic, bouncy, comfy, resilient, springy, not soft, not firm but rebounding and absorbing. Your not going to come away from this thinking its dull or harsh or mushy, its like if you sit on a medicine ball and bounce up and down, its not soft, its not hard, the bounce is fun to repeat but its not going to blast you through the roof and doesn't feel crazy, all over the place like a spastic in a bath tub.

Outsole - Not a worry, ive seen lesser covered soles get love. Dont even worry about this, not too thick, not slippery, no markings yet. You don't notice it there nor do you notice any drama after the run.

Speed - I'm surprised by this the most, i wasn't expecting it to turn over like it does, I'm not fast but i fell back into my low 20 5k times with ease and without pushing, i didn't even know i was at that speed while running. It just pushes you on, no extra effort put in, you just glide. The bounce/midsole response/comfort just make it nice and easy to roll through your stride without feeling poked. It just works together well. I cant fault how this feels at all.

**Worth buying?:**

100% yes. Beats the Superblast, Novablast, Triumph, Endo Speed, Endo Shift, Glideride, 1080, Morev4, Boston 12 for me comfortably. I loved the Invincible 2, thought it was the best shoe I've felt. Id buy the Skyward X again at full price over the Invincible 2 being for sale for $1.",2024-04-21 01:34:36+00:00,46,44

1c8x0w5,FootFunction,NB or Hoka for capsulitis of the 2nd toe?," 

Hi all and thanks in advance.

Been dealing with capsulitis of the 2nd toe for almost a year (diagnosed by PCP). Currently waiting for an appointment with the podiatrist which will happen in who knows how long. Took a break from running/walking for about a year as well and just been on the stair master. (cycling aggravates my Achilles)

I have scoured the depths of reddit and found many recommending Hoka Bondi 8 but haven't seen much about NB. Was wondering what your thoughts were on styles like NB 993 or 990 for gym and occasional stair master? I'm going to take a break from running/walking long distances for a long time.

I know I need a wide toe box with cushion and a stiff sole that's preferably rocker bottom. I am wearing a metatarsal pad which sometimes helps and have just ordered toe spacers. Will also be taping the toe starting today. I've eliminated barefoot walking and tried to control inflammation with NSAIDs and ice/rest. I also started doing some foot strengthening exercises. 

Please let me know if there is a better sub for me to post this. ",2024-04-20 18:35:40+00:00,1,3

1c8hhzf,AskDocs,Podiatry: Nail bed injury from too small shoes,"I bought expensive daily wear shoes for work (Hokas) in early January. I didn't realize they were too small at the time, but I thought it would be fine despite some mild discomfort and bruising under my left big toenail. I noticed a deep ""Beau's line"" had formed but I kept my nails trimmed shorter and I'm in no pain and I thought everything was fine.

I've just now realized, months later, that the nail is no longer attached at the cuticle, and it seems I will lose the nail in time. No pain, redness, or other signs of infection, but that back end of the nail is now soft, thin and *spongy feeling* and it's creeping me the heck out. Behind that thin nail towards the germinal matrix I can feel no new hard nail growing out. I've never lost a nail before or had a nail bed injury, so I have no idea what this process is like, or if an injury like this could have done permanent damage. I'm hoping the growth of sturdy nail has just paused and will at some point start up again.

Is there anything other than infection that I should be looking out for? At this stage is there anything a podiatrist could do to prevent permanent nail disfigurement?

Thank you.

Shoes I own: Superblast, Rocket x2, Mach X, Adios Pro 3, Endorphin Speed 3 and Tecton X2.

Fit: Upper is nice and soft, a lot of padding in the tongue. The heel fits like a cup, which help when going uphill because these shoes does not bend. It doesn‚Äôt have the widest fit and i experienced a little heel slippage which was corrected quickly with some relacing.

Ride: It is a big shoe with a lot of foam. I‚Äôve read many being worried about the weight. Doing most of my long runs in my Superblasts you definately feel a difference holding them in your hands. On foot, not so much. The stiffness, energy return and rocker makes it really effortless to run. Doing a couple of zone 2 runs for a total of 20k, I often found myself going too fast for what I had planned. They make you feel like you‚Äôre running on autopilot. They are very forgiving on your legs, I do not feel the slightest soreness after my two runs, neither do I have any blisters etc. Even though the stack is high, they are very stable. I ran some sections where the terrain was slightly tilted to the side (left foot came higher than my right foot), which felt weird and uncomfortable because of how tall and stable they are.

Conclusion: Very happy with the purchase. Got them on 20% off. Looking forward to doing mye long and easy runs in these. Will be interesting to see how they hold up over time.",2024-04-18 18:44:10+00:00,154,78
1c7249v,CaminoDeSantiago,"Having Done the Portuguese Way Solo at *Possibly* One of the Worst Times, Here are Some Thoughts: ","Hello!

33F here. 

I just finished the Portuguese Coastal Way solo. I walked from 31 March to 14 April and I say it‚Äôs one of the worst times because for the first three days many restaurants (not accommodation places) were closed for the Easter weekend. 

It also rained for the first week, with heavy rains for about three/four days.

Despite that, it was the most incredible experience.

Lesson 1: Your experience will be amazing despite the weather and despite the period, but you have to give yourself enough time. I saw many people sadly have to leave because they‚Äôd only given themselves 10/11 days for the whole way and their blisters, muscle pain, joint pain were too bad to carry on. 

Lesson 1.1: Because of things being closed, finding food and coffee at the right time was tricky. Get the coffee and snacks when you can, dont wait for the next place. 

The Camino will get even the fittest people. You need to give yourself space for a possible rest day or two. 

Lesson 2: I learnt this from a doctor on the trail. Don‚Äôt make your rest days total NO walking days. Make those days a lot lighter. A 5km or 10km walk is better than nothing at all. You still want to keep your body aware of what you‚Äôre doing without tiring it out. 

Lesson 3: I asked almost every person I met about blisters lol. I wanted to figure out what shoes were the best. Trail runners are a better option. I met many people on the trail who came in hiking boots. Only ONE person didn‚Äôt have bad blisters and later on in the journey I saw her and she said on one particularly rainy day, when she was doing a mountain trail, her hiking boots got extremely wet and she hadn‚Äôt been able to dry them  properly dry since. I bought a one size up pair of ASICS Gel Ventures a few days before my walk (not ideal, i know) but I  didn‚Äôt have any problems, although I have seen people on here say that ASICS‚Äô toe box can be too narrow. I asked every Hoka wearing pilgrim about blisters because I wanted to know if they‚Äôre that good, and yes, they are. Many people said they got no blisters or only one or two. 

Lesson 4: For the women, keep your pack 5kgs and under. I know they say 10% of your body weight, but that shit adds up. The people who had better walks had lighter packs. I weigh 64kg, my pack was about 7.5 and I thought that would be fined. It didn‚Äôt strain my back so at first I thought the weight was fine. I met veteran pilgrims who showed me that I was carrying the extra weight on my ass/hips. Got rid of some stuff and instantly walked better. 

Lesson 5: You WILL meet people. But you also have to make the effort. I didn‚Äôt really make friends for the first week because I was so exhausted at the end of each walking day that I couldn‚Äôt talk to anyone. I felt a bit sad about this. But then one day I felt better, I could talk to people, and I made some incredible friends who I will cherish forever. 

Lesson 6: Tiger balm will be your best friend. Instant relief everywhere you rub it. 

Lesson 7: if it‚Äôs raining heavily, you‚Äôre leaving later than usual, or you‚Äôre going to a small village, book a hostel in the morning or the night before. It will give you peace of mind. Most of the time you don‚Äôt need to do this. But i did see people struggle a bit more when those three things came up. 

Lesson 8: Being a bit closer to Santiago on your last day is really nice. Most people walk from Padr√≥n on the last day, which is 26km. We kept walking to see how far we could get. Got tempted by some sangria, stopped at the bar, realized they had beds and slept there for the night lol. It was 18km on our last day, which gave us energy to properly celebrate when we reached Santiago.

This shoe is honestly everything you want in a daily trainer that can hit those faster paces not quite a super daily trainer like a new balance supercomp v2 or an Adidas Takumi Sen 10 but for the $160 price tag it‚Äôs for sure something special, the employee at the rabbit pop up shop at the Boston marathon explained it as ‚Äúa cross between a Hoka Bondi 8 and a Saucony Speed 3‚Äù I personally do not own Bondi 8s but have run in them before and have speed 3 and a decent amount of miles in them I def agree with this statement for what it‚Äôs worth you will def be able to hit the faster paces you desire without sacrificing cushion. I did a 10k progression run as my first run the first two miles I def had to adjust to the shoe as there was a bit of discomfort where the carbon was I‚Äôm not sure if this was due to the carbon or that it‚Äôs just naturally a bit tighter near the middle but it ended up smoothing itself out through the run when I started hitting those faster paces, I am not a mid foot striker however the carbon ‚Äúribs‚Äù themselves are very loud I‚Äôve notice they crunch pretty hard on impact I believe just due to the nature of them being exposed on the bottom of the shoes outright instead of having some layer of cushion between the carbon and bottom the first few times I herd the louder crunches I thought I was stepping on rocks or small sticks but it was literally just the carbon.

1c5t8gj,FootFunction,"Hallux limitus, pain in 2nd toe, pain and tingling on outside of right ankle","In my left foot, I have developed hallux limitus, but the main problem is that I have pain on the ball of the foot under the 2nd toe. MRI has confirmed the arthritis.  I had an ultrasound of the left foot and the 2nd MPTJ is absolutely fine.  Doctor believes the hallux limitus is causing the weight distribution to go towards the lesser toes, causing somehow the pain under the 2nd toe.  The left arch is completely collapsed when I put my foot on the ground.  I suspect the big toe problem was set off around 4 years ago by doing planks barefoot, putting weight on the ends of the toes instead of the balls of the feet, as I should have done.  It got noticeably worse to the point where I'm at now, wen last July, I did some press-ups, again resting on the tips of my toes again.  In both cases, my right big toe was fine, but it really made my left big toe hurt.  


In the right foot, I do have some arch.  At the time I started all the above problems with my left foot (last July), my right foot started to feel uncomfortable.  The worst part is that the outside front of my right ankle aches and sometimes feels a bit numb.  The dorsiflexion of my right foot is limited.  It has been that way for many years.    


Both feet have minor Morton's Neuromas between 3rd and 4th toes too.  


The weird thing is that cycling aggravates my left foot more than running.  In fact, a couple of months before I did my left toe in last year, I noticed an uncomfortable pulling sensation under my left 2nd toe (ball of the foot) when cycling.  


I have seen 2 sports doctors.  The first one did a cortisone injection into my left 1st MPTJ, which did not give me any noticeable benefit.  If anything it made the joint feel worse for a month or so.  I saw a physiotherapist who gave me foot exercises and a custom orthotics.  The exercises made no difference. The orthotics made my feet a bit more comfortable, but didn't improve the 2nd toe ball of foot pain.  I then stopped seeing her.  


I then saw another sports doctor who seemed much more clued up.  It was he who did a thorough ultrasound examination of both feet - and found nothing apart from hallux limitus and the 2 neuromas.  Unfortunately he didn't examine my ankle as he ran out of time!  At this time, I stopped with the physio and saw a podiatrist who specialises in biomechanics of feet.   Based on the 2nd doctor's results, she added padding at the front and back of the left orthotic to try to get the load off my lesser toes.  She also added padding behind the ball of the foot, although that was because she suspected capsulitis or plantar plate tear (the 2nd toe droops a bit downwards with a sort of minor hammertoe).   All that made absolutely no difference!  


The podiatrist has given me standing heel raise exercies with feet turned slightly inwards.  


I really doubt that there is any orthotic out there that will fix all this. I suspect there is some problem with the way I'm 'using' my feet, or perhaps it's to do with my ankles.  


The other aggravating factor is probably that although I'm fairly fit, everything is tight, and I have never had much flexibility.  However, I can do a deep squat, although my feet don't like it.  


I have stopped running since last year, not because of pain (although it would be a bit uncomfortable now), but more in the hope that my feet will get better if I don't stress them with running.  I am trying to get back to cycling, though the pain under my 2nd toe is limiting my progress.  


I'm wearing Hoka Cliton 9's.  The rocker and stiff sole seem quite helpful.  


I would appreciate any ideas as to how to proceed towards getting my feet sorted out, as I'm not having any luck with medical professionals.",2024-04-16 22:22:40+00:00,1,1

1c4uip4,CaminoDeSantiago,Getting ready for the Camino: questions.,"Hello all! 

I‚Äôm less than two months away from my Camino de Portuguese and had a few questions + wanted to receive tips and pointers.

I‚Äôm starting either Lisbon or Santarem from flying in on the 6th of June to July 5th and wanted to spend a day or two in Lisbon (at the beginning and night before returning maybe) and Porto. Regarding this time frame, if I wanted to start in Santarem could I get my pilgrim‚Äôs passport a day or two before, bus to Santarem, and get my first stamp there? 

A general question of transportation: when (if) going to Santarem or coming back to Lisbon from Santiago, what‚Äôs the best means of public transport? Should I bus or use the train? What busses/trains should I use? Should I book ahead of time (if so, how far out)? 

Would I be able to get my certificate in Santiago the day that I get there or should I get there anticipating to stick around another day for my certificate?

Regarding Lisbon or Santarem, there‚Äôs a ~3ish mile difference in daily pace that I‚Äôd have to do. I‚Äôm currently not very active but I don‚Äôt have any medical conditions. I started practicing long distance walking but still, I‚Äôve never done anything like this so advice would be appreciated in deciding.

For walking I have Hoka‚Äôs and Choco‚Äôs. I just started walking in my Choco‚Äôs and they gave me blisters on my ~7 mile walk today. I heard they‚Äôre good for hiking but any foot care tips, especially around Choco‚Äôs, would be great.

And any other general tips would be appreciated. I know this is a laundry list of things but any response would be appreciated. Thank you!

1c4pmni,trailrunning,New trail runner needing help with shoes!,"Hi trail peeps! I've been trail running for the last 6mo and have been loving it. The only problem is I'm having issues finding the right shoes. Or more specifically shoes that don't totally squash my does on descents - other than my icebugs in the winter.

In your experience is this just a fact of trail running? Something that might change as I get more comfortable going downhill? Or something I can remedy with the right shoes? 

Here's what I've tried (note: these are all sized properly and I lace them with a heel lock):
- started with Hoka Challenger ATR 6 - they were on sale and didn't want to spend too much. These are a major toe squishing adventure.

- ran all winter in Icebug Pytho6 and loved them. Totes felt great, feet felt locked in 

- went replace the challengers and ended up with the Hoka Mafate Speed 4. Super comfortable but then felt exactly the same as the challengers on descents. I was lucky to be able to exchange them. 

- exchanged them for the New Balance Fresh Foam X Heirro 8. These are suuuuper comfortable and great to run on. Heel feels more locked in than the hokas but still a little toe squishy on descents. Debating if I should keep or try something else. 

Would love your thoughts + wisdom!! ",2024-04-15 15:51:44+00:00,2,15
1c4mrat,Marathon_Training,Has anyone else dealt with Plantar Fasciitis? How did you recover?,"For about 6 months now, I‚Äôve been battling plantar fasciitis and possibly a nerve entrapment. The pain in my inner arch/heel is almost constant. I have very limited health insurance coverage (US based) and not a lot of extra money to spend on recovery. I can‚Äôt afford physical therapy sessions or treatments so it‚Äôs been a frustrating uphill battle. 

Recently a found a strength and mobility training program created by a marathon focused PT and her entire plan cost what one session of physical therapy would cost me. I‚Äôm starting that this week and hoping for the best.

Much to my chagrin, I‚Äôve also dialed back my mileage significantly. I‚Äôm only running 2-3 days a week and no more than 9 miles in a single run (weekly mileage around 8-14 miles). It‚Äôs been hard to dial back but I‚Äôve been doing the elliptical/bike at my apartment gym and I‚Äôm going to start swimming to keep up my cardiovascular endurance. It‚Äôs so hard not to run though!! 

I‚Äôve also been trying to shorten my stride and just generally strengthen my body because I know that‚Äôs a big part of the issue. I have really weird feet/ankles/legs and have walked pigeon-toed and severely over-pronated all my life. Plus my feet are flat so I just have a lot of physical obstacles. But I just can‚Äôt fathom giving up marathoning. It‚Äôs so frustrating because cardio wise and mental game wise I‚Äôm all there. It‚Äôs just my dang feet! Haha.

Oh I‚Äôm also going to change up my shoes. For the last 5 years I‚Äôve run in New Balance 880s, but I might try Hokas or another model that‚Äôs good for flat feet. Any advice there? 

I‚Äôm hoping that if I continue this over the next 12-16 weeks, I‚Äôll be ready to start training for my next marathon in the fall/winter (gradually upping my weekly mileage over the next 12-16 weeks so it‚Äôs not too much when I start training again).

Has anyone else suffered from PF or just heel/arch pain in general? Any other flat footed runners able to give me some hope? How did you get over it and what do you recommend? I really wish I could afford going to a professional sports medicine doc or PT, but that‚Äôs just financially impossible for me right now unfortunately.

TLDR: I‚Äôve got flat feet and can‚Äôt afford PT. I‚Äôve been struggling with plantar fasciitis for 6 months now and I‚Äôm looking for recovery advice from other runners. ",2024-04-15 13:52:34+00:00,2,11

After 1 year of this injury from August 2022 to August 2023, I'm now able to run and walk barefooted. Below are advices and the things I did to recover this ridiculous injury.

Note that this is based on my personal experience. It might or might not work for you. So, if you do have this condition, please consult a well knowledge and passionate orthopedic who knows about this condition because I had an incompetent doctor at first who told me that physio was useless and to eat painkiller constantly. I had to consult another professional for this. My doctor had me going to the sports physio and podiatry.

Depending on your pain, you may find that wearing insoles and proper shoes may help you in the early stage. For me, my pain was around 8/10, along with burning and electrical sensations. My doctor prescribed me with stiff rigid boots known as Dacros boot. I paired it together with a dancer pad to offload completely by avoiding contact with my sesamoids. Again, this might be subjective, I wear my boots only outdoors, but in the indoors, I wear Offos slipper. All these were done to calm down some of my symptoms.

I worked together with my physio as well. My physio had me working on my lower limp strength. These are summaries of what he assigned me to do:  

1) Calve/ankle strengthening with a resistant band. 
2) Using a tennis ball to massage the arch of your foot. (I find this really useful)
3) Balancing. Wall assisted marching to single leg balancing for 10 seconds.
4) Banded toe curl strengthening and toe curling with the tower underneath.
5) I was able to do squats without pain, so he assigned me with lunges and slowly progressed to split squat. I bent my affected toe only to the point where I feel no pain. 
6) Swim or cycle if you are able to. I had a shoulder injury at that time so I could not do this.

All the exercises done above were to promote blood flow and simulations for recovery. Note that the above exercises were done progressively over time. Besides exercises, he also provided me with shockwave and ultrasound therapy. This may be subjective, I didn't feel a difference after doing it, but it may have contributed to the overall recovery. 

On my own, I did daily contrast bathing, calf stretch, hip and glute stretch,  quads stretch, hamstring stretch, and toe extension stretch.

The turning point here was walking with proper shoes and insole. For the transitioning phase, I had a difficulty weaning out of my boots. I wore my boots for about 6 to 7 months of time. I believe I was afraid of the pain and discomfort (burning sensations), which makes me avoid wearing shoes for a long time. Once I felt I was ready, I visited podiatry for an insole and advice. He told me to get a shoe with rocker bottom, wide toe box, and cushioning. He recommended me HOKA. Depending on whether you need stability or not, I got the Hoka arahi 6. With proper shoes and insoles, I tried to walk for 10 minutes one time per week. At first, the pain was 2-4, but it was not sharp, so I continued. As I walk, I have gotten used to the pain, and over time, I have managed to run and walk barefooted. When I said recovered, it does not necessarily mean that it is completely pain-free for me. To this day, I still have some sort of pain, but it does not stop me from performing my activity.

Overall, I would say that this condition requires a lot of patience. You need to listen to your body. Do not hesitate to try. If it is just discomfort with pain that can be endured that you should be able to walk. I was also on the verge of surgery, but I kept trying until it worked.",2024-04-15 04:10:03+00:00,13,1

1c3xqvj,trailrunning,Race Report: Rattler 50K - 2024,"I always like reading these to help prepare, so figured I would pay it back.

**Race**: Rattler 50 km in Palmer Park, Colorado Springs

**Time**: 5:04:26 (4th overall)

**Training**:

Just got into trail running last summer, so still relatively new. Was never really a runner before that but fell in love with trail running, and have been doing it steadily since last August.

Kept a good base of aerobic fitness throughout the winter, which can be a challenge in Colorado given the weather. But on the plus side, when the weather cooperated, trail runs with large elevation gain are easy to come by. Peak training weeks were in the 60+ mile range, long runs between 24-27 miles & 3K+ ft of elevation gain.

The week before the race, I did a practice run of the course (1 lap, so \~25K), and my number 1 concern was how many trails are in Palmer Park and how confusing it can be to follow the right one. If you just look at the map, it‚Äôs like running in a maze. My practice run did not go well. I was on AllTrails on my phone the entire run, trying to figure out which paths to follow.

But Mad Moose did a great job flagging the course. Kudos to them, they always put on a great event. There were a few times on the course where I had to pump the brakes a little and look around for a flag to make sure I was going the right way. But no complete stops or the dreaded U-turn where you realize you went the wrong way. Overall no issues route finding.

**Gear**:

¬∑ Hoka Arahi 6

¬∑ Darn Tough socks ‚Äì these socks are the best

¬∑ Salomon shorts and t-shirt

¬∑ Aonijie running vest

¬∑ Aonijie 0.5L collapsible water bottle with electrolytes

¬∑ Platypus 1L hydration bladder

¬∑ Janji hat

¬∑ Jabra Elite 7 active headphones

**Food**: This is what I carried in my vest to start the race.

¬∑ 8 Clif bloks

¬∑ 1 Honey Stingers chews packet

¬∑ 1 Gu Roctane octane gel

¬∑ 1 Honey Stinger gel

¬∑ 1 Honey Stinger waffle

**Race day**:

I don‚Äôt usually eat in the mornings and do my long runs fasted, but given the task I hand, I decided to have some electrolytes in my pre-race caffeine drink.

The race started at 7am. It was a particularly hot day for early April‚Ä¶at the start I think the weather was already in the 50s, by the time I completed it was well into the 70s.

Ate a blok right at the start, and started conservatively sipping my electrolytes early on, maybe mile \~6. Next blok at mile 7, then ate consistently every 2 miles or so from there, continuing to hydrate conservatively as needed.

Found some folks who were running at a nice pace early on. Hung with them for the first 4 miles then pulled ahead. Ran by myself for the rest of the race, which was fine by me for the most part, although sometimes it can be motivating to at least see other runners to catch up to.

Was running pretty fast early on, but not too fast. I have made the mistake of going out too fast in a 50k or 50M only to seriously regret it on the back half, so was trying to be cognizant of that.

Skipped the first two aid stations. Was still feeling great and had enough water and snacks to last for a while. Made it to the end of lap #1 and decided to skip that aid station as well. I think there were 1 or 2 other 50K runners filling up there, but not sure.

At this point, I was starting to feel it a little for sure, but not too bad.  I feel like there is something about doing laps that adds another psychological element. Like everything I just ran, all of those steep hills and challenging parts, I have to do AGAIN? Except now I have to do it while tired and sore. Awesome. Wonderful. Mind over matter and power forward.

Started to conserve energy where I could during the early part of lap #2. Feet were starting to hurt. When I passed by the 10K aid station I asked a volunteer and he told me I was in 4th. Nice! Now I just had to catch the 3rd place person to podium. Easier said than done, but nice to have some motivation.

By the time I got to aid station #4, I was starting to fade. I decided to skip that aid station too (all part of my original plan to only use the aid station if/when I ran out of water and snacks).

The section between aid station #4 and #5 is the most challenging part of the course in my opinion. Lots of steep elevation gain. The biggest climb is actually after aid station #5 (and #2 during the first lap). But the challenge with this portion is that the elevation gain is steep and rolling (more on this later).

At this point I really started to fade. It was hot out. I lost a lot of water through sweat. It was getting harder to down my bloks & gels. I ran out of water. And I may or may not have been getting a little delusional. At one point I saw a tennis ball on the ground and for a split second I thought about picking it up because ""it would make a great souvenir for my dog"". Idk, don‚Äôt judge me, I was deep in the pain cave at that point.

Finally made it to aid station #5 after some very slow splits and some walking. I was in a bad place. I filled up on electrolytes, chugged, filled up again, chugged again. Filled up a third time. All of that ‚Äúconservative sipping‚Äù may have come back to haunt me because I was dehydrated. Ate a piece of banana and then some life-saving volunteer offered me a pickle. That pickle saved me. Gave me the boost I needed to then start off on the big climb.

I also asked a volunteer if I was close to the 3rd place runner and she said no. Turns out that guy was 30min ahead of me which is crazy impressive to me. Anyway, new game plan: instead of catch #3, goal was to hold off #5!

The rest of the race was tough. I was still in the pain cave and not moving very fast at all. But slowly and steadily made progress until finally the finish line was in sight. I gave it one last push and made it across in just over 5hrs for 4th place overall. Missed the podium, but I was still happy with the performance and happy to be done because boy was I suffering.

After the race I immediately laid down until I started to feel better. Then helped myself to the buffet of snacks, water, a sprite, and multiple bowls of enchiladas.

**Lessons learned**:

¬∑ Pickle at aid station = game changer

¬∑ Rolling hills are a different animal than just pure elevation gain. This 50K had less elevation gain than other races & LR‚Äôs I have done, but it was deceivingly challenging still. For the trails I was training on, there are usually 2 or 3 big climbs where it is obvious to conserve energy, then you‚Äôre back on your way once you summit. With the Rattler, the climbs were steep and sprinkled throughout which was a different type of challenge for me.

¬∑ Hoka Arahi 6‚Äôs got the job done but there may be room for improvement. I was alternating between those, the Speedgoat 5‚Äôs, and the ASICS Kayano 30s during training. Usually any LR's in the mid twenties I start to feel it in my feet no matter which I wear (the Kayano‚Äôs probably felt best if I ranked them), and this race was no exception (foot pain started during the 2nd lap). For race day I decided to go with Arahi because I thought they may be a little faster than the Kayano‚Äôs. Who knows if that was the right decision. Maybe next time I‚Äôll do the Kayano‚Äôs or another shoe if I find something that is the right combination of comfortable and fast for a long distance.",2024-04-14 16:37:01+00:00,13,0

1c3a982,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Tecton X 2 - First Run,"Recently found the Tecton X 2 on a great deal (EUR 160) and couldn't say no. 

I took them out on their first run today, a 21km (13 miles) long run with 600 metres of elevation gain, 5km were run at Threshold intensity. 

Smaller runner, 70kg, 01:28 HM PB. They fit me true to size (I am an EU 42), but it's definitely a dialed in, racey fit. 

I have to say, the first impressions were pretty amazing. Very light and propulsive ride, comfortable and cushioned but also stable despite the high stack. They supposedly need a bit to break in, so I am really looking forward if they can get even better. 

I really like the way the Tecton X 2 lets me lock into a pace on flatter sections. I have read that other reviewers found them a bit awkward at easy paces but I didn't experience that at all. My easy pace on the flats is between 05:35 and 05:55 mins per km and the shoes hummed along quite well at that range. When speeding up in the latter half of my run, the shoes came alive and felt really propulsive. 

Overall, it seems like a well-constructed, lightweight shoe. I especially like the fit of the Matryx upper and the construction of the midsole. Great job, Hoka. 

So far, versatility is my only concern with those. I used them on rolling, non-technical terrain today and it seems that's what they're best for. 

But living in Central Europe, some of my upcoming races will take me through montainous, more technical terrain. And I am not sure how they would perform there. They didn't feel too natural on the uphills and the high stack and lack of lug depth probably means I would need to take extra care on technical downhills. 

TLDR: Great first experience, a premium, propulsive and light shoe. Jury is still out on their performance on more technical terrain.",2024-04-13 19:41:32+00:00,47,15

1c2xeb0,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Skyward X: First run & some comparisons to other super trainers,"Here's some first run thoughts of Hoka Skyward X, after an easier 9km run with them. 

Sizing

True to size. Where Hoka Rocket X is borderline TTS (some think it runs too small), Skyward X felt just great in my usual 42 2/3 size (42.5 in Saucony, Nike).

Flexibility

None, you can't bend the shoe at all.

Firmness

More Endorphin Shift 2 than NB SC Trainer v1. 

Upper

Comfortable, well done. Had some minor heel slip on right feet. It wasn't bad, some lacing improvements should take care of it.

Ride

First thought was that this could be a great long run shoe. Stability is above average vs the other super shoes and the shoe rolls really nicely.

But, after few kilometers I started encountering some issues with my soles. The plate seems to be placed really close to your feet and it caused some issues for me. During the winter I've ran mostly with plateless (or nylon plated) shoes so I'm not sure if the harsh feeling was caused by the unfamiliarity. 

Nevertheless, good rocker and good midsole made it easy to keep up the pace.

I don't think you can pick up pace in this show. Tempo is probably the fastest pace one can expect from this. 

Comparisons

Asics Superblast: Maybe the nearest competitor. Similar stability and feel, but Skyward X has much more lively midsole and better rocker. Where I think Superblast is cumbersome, Skyward X just rolls forward. Both have well executed upper, Hoka's outsole seems to be more effective.

Prime X Strung 2: Hoka's shoe is more stable and though the weight difference is small, Skyward X doesn't feel so bottom heavy as Prime X Strung 2. Upper is no comparison, Hoka is better. With Prime X (no matter what version) you always seem to be battling with lace biting. Prime X has (IMHO) a  better midsole and better plate placement. 

NB SC Trainer v1: New Balance is softer and less stable. 

In some ways Hoka Skyward X feels like a shoe Endorphin Shift 4 could have been, if Saucony had updated Endorphin Shift 2 this year. Shift 2 is a better comparison than Shift 3, which had softer foam and less effective rocker than v2 had.",2024-04-13 08:47:14+00:00,82,61

I started my journey running in my old brooks. It was fine for 3-5 mile runs, but they already had tons of miles on them and were about 2 years old. I went to Fleet Feet (a running specific store where I live) and the rep helped me measure my feet and get new shoes.

I was a size 9, with high arches‚Ä¶but at the upper end of normal, lower end of official high arches. She sold me some Altra lone Peak 7s, with some $50 arch supports. I live in a rural area and run / ran on mostly old gravel roads. 

I ran in those through my weeks with long runs around 7-10 miles. But because the miles increased, I eventually started running routes 50% pavement-50% gravel. The altra‚Äôs had almost no cushion and my feet were always killing me. I thought I had stress fractures it was so bad. I limped around and even took a week off (just rode my bike). I was pretty sure my long running days were over. 

Then I got the idea that maybe it was my shoes causing the problem. I went online and bought Hoka Mach 6, and a pair of Hola Bondi 8. I also picked up a pair of those ‚Äúrecovery slides‚Äù and I wear them in the house.

I eased into the miles again (still believing I might have stress fractures and not wanting to overdue anything). I‚Äôm talking 3-5 mile jogs at 1/10 pace, then working up as I gauged how my feet felt.

The Mach 6 seemed to do the trick. My gimpyness improved enough that I could run and walk comfortably, but not issue free. Now I always feel like I have this nagging bruise on the pads of my feet. It‚Äôs not sharp, just like a light bruise. Not in the bottom arches either (like previously), now it‚Äôs solidly on the pads of my feet on the outside. It doesn‚Äôt feel like tendons and ligaments, like before, but feels like muscle. 

Like I said, I ran 16 yesterday, and as I sit here typing, I‚Äôm very aware of how the bottom of my right foot hurts.

I‚Äôm going to continue running. That‚Äôs not really a question. I‚Äôd like to run with less pain though. And I really mean pain after I‚Äôm home, showered, doing recovery. Does anyone one know what‚Äôs up with this? These are the longest runs I‚Äôve ever done‚Ä¶.is it just my feet getting tougher? I was an avid cyclist who started running, so my theory is that while I had really strong legs, I had/have very weak feet, if that makes sense, and they‚Äôre going to need to develop. You don‚Äôt really pound your feet on anything even when you‚Äôre hammering it on the bike.

Pain from stressing my muscles is great, injuring myself is horrible and I‚Äôll do pretty much anything to avoid it. I‚Äôd love to get some thoughts of our more experienced runners on here.",2024-04-12 11:45:06+00:00,7,19

1c1rhra,bunions,My bunions wear holes in my Brooks shoes. I‚Äôm wondering if Hokas are more durable and longer lasting.,"Brooks are the most comfortable shoes I‚Äôve owned. Probably because the soft fabric across my bunions feels better than a shoe that has tight leather rubbing across them. Unfortunately that also means my bunions wear holes through the shoes pretty quickly.

My first pair of Brooks were Adrenalines, and my current ones are Cascadias. Both pairs were in a size wide. Both pairs have worn holes through them the same way.

I use them for everyday use and dog walking, maybe averaging about 3-4 miles a day. I would guess both pairs made it to about 6 months of regular use, and then started showing signs of wear across the bunions. The rest of the shoe is still in great condition.

I love the way Brooks feel, but since they are a pricier shoe, I‚Äôm disappointed they don‚Äôt last longer. I see people in this sub recommend the Hoka Bondis for bunion comfort, but I was wondering if anyone could tell me how they hold up to bunion wear. If I like the way Brooks feel, would I like Hokas? What about Hoka Bondis vs Hoka Clifton‚Äôs?",2024-04-11 21:52:49+00:00,7,9

I found some Peregrines on super sale and I was wondering if anyone has made that switch?
I noticed the drop is low (4 mm) ... How's the fit? Are they too narrow?

I've also have ran in Hoka Speedgoats and I love them. 

How do the Peregrines feel?

I know best way is to go to a store and try them but unfortunately I don't have one near me that has these.

1c1pqwu,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Cielo X1 - Marathon Review,"**TLDR**: I originally posted my first thoughts in a comparison post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/comments/1bd49zl/unscientific_shoe_comparison_metaspeed_sky_paris/) where I decided that the Hoka Cielo X1 (CX1) would be my shoe choice for the LA Marathon. It did not disappoint and I ended up hitting my sub 2:50 goal and running a 6+ min PR. If you like rockered shoes, this is as good as it gets.

**Background**: M, 5‚Äô10‚Äô‚Äô (178cm), 165lb (75kg). Cadence around 175 at easy paces and 180 at race paces. Not sure where I land, but I tend to load the forefoot pretty hard and rarely ever feel my heel really pressing into the foam.

**Sizing**: True to size. I wear a 10.5 US in most shoes and that worked great here. Fit is comparable to the Vaporfly 3 for narrow-to-medium foot.

**Upper/Fit**: The shoe is a little hard to get on, but once you do the lockdown is great in the heel and midfoot. The upper is definitely overbuilt for a racer and is one of the reasons for the heftier weight. The toebox has a decent amount of width/volume, especially for a Hoka. I had no major blisters or other issues during the race. There have been a lot of comments about the laces, which have been pretty divisive, but I actually like them. The laces are wide so they sit really nicely on top of your foot and the tension really stays put when tightening. I read comments about the laces coming undone for people, but it really makes me wonder if people know how to tie a knot. As long as you get a good tight double knot, the laces are not coming undone. I've never had laces come untied during a run and that is no different here.

**Midsole**: You can tell this is PEBA, and a lot of it, immediately upon step in. It has a nice soft, resilient feel, somewhere between FF Turbo and Zoomx. The dual density foam really works nicely here. Hoka also pulled a Mizuno trick by having the heel come in just below the World Athletics 40mm limit, but the midfoot definitely has more than 40mm of stack. The CX1 looks as tall as my pair of Superblasts and I couldn't tell a difference in height when standing with one on each foot.

**Ride**: Copying from my first thoughts post because my feelings haven't changed. Fun, bouncy, efficient. Holy crap, this shoe surprised me. It is probably the most fun shoe I've ran in. I agree with other reviews that this is a more stable Prime X Strung. The ride is actually kind of similar to the Mizuno Wave Rebellion Pro in that there is a sweet spot on the midfoot, but the sweet spot here feels much larger and allows for greater variation in footstrike, and the foam in the CX1 is much bouncier. It's also stable enough due to the width that I don't have to worry about my footstrike as much. Plenty of reviews mention the weight, which is true that it's on the heavy side, however the ride more than makes up for the weight IMO.

I also want to note that the rocker really saved my achilles and calves. I've been dealing with achilles tendonitis for a bit now and I had no issues here. My calves were barely sore after the race and my achilles felt fine. However, my quads were pretty beat up, but I think that's mostly because of the steep downhills on the course.

**Outsole**: No complaints, there is plenty of outsole rubber. Probably too much for a race day shoe, it's another reason the shoe is so heavy. I haven't taken it in the rain so can't comment too much on grip, but I didn't slip at all when running through the aid stations where the ground was pretty wet.

**Stability**: This is one of the wider super shoes throughout the length of the shoe which definitely made it feel more stable for me. The foam cutout on the lateral side of the shoe helps with pronation a bit and didn't cause me any issues with excess supination as others have noted.

**Overall**: This shoe is fantastic and makes a great marathon racer. Yes, it weighs more than other racing shoes, but I never noticed the weight during the race and the rocker really helped me keep my leg turnover up in the later miles. Even Hoka sponsored athletes have opted for the CX1 over the Rocket X2 in some big races recently. Hillary Bor placed 4th in the NYC Half rocking the CX1s. I almost feel like Hoka made the shoe heavier on purpose so they can easily shave weight on the next version. I still want to give the Metaspeed Sky Paris a shot, I just need to get some pinky toe issues fixed, but if I can't make it work I have no issues sticking with the CX1. If Hoka shaves an ounce of weight on the next version and maintains the same ride, it will be a game changer IMO.

**Comparisons**: As previously mentioned, it rides like a more stable (and lighter) Prime X Strung and a bouncier Wave Rebellion Pro.

1c1klm5,trailrunning,Need replacement for OG Tech Amphibs,"I do a lot of kayaking, screwing around in the lakes and rivers and walking the dog on nasty trails during the spring-fall seasons in GA. Slightly wide feet but nothing horrendous. Used the OG Tech Amphibs for years. Best lake shoes I have ever used but the soles are coming off and it's time to replace. Was looking at the Hoka SG5 as I have heard they drain really well. Would just grab the TechAmphib 5s but heard they have narrowed the toe box quite a bit and people have reported issues with durability in this current gen. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: need ""not-narrow"" trail running, high drainage, water play shoes that won't leave my feet a blistery mess when we go light hiking/camping/ect. ",2024-04-11 17:17:11+00:00,1,2
1c1e930,RunningShoeGeeks,Puma Velocity Nitro 2 First Impressions,"Background - 178/5‚Äô10, 86kg/193.5cheesburgers, US mens 10 or 28cm, Greek toes, wide forefoot, small heels and medium arches. Currently rehabbing from MTSS (shin splints). 

WOW these shoes cost me $79NZD from the Puma store online, what a steal. With my wide forefoot and an easy Z2 20 minute treadmill run, these have amazing responsiveness, cushion and a super comfortable fit. The upper is super stretchy and indeed quite thick with that double material so would be warm with poor ventilation in summer with my sweaty feet. My 4/5 toes just hang off the sides and are allowed to splay with no pain. 

Compared to my Hoka Clifton 9 (61km in) these feel way nicer as daily trainer, the Hoka are wayyyyy too narrow at the 3/4/5 toes at the front and I get blisters on my 3rd toe and sore pinky toes after running longer than 10km and I think they made my shin splints worse by cramping my feet? The upper just has no stretch so I‚Äôve retired them from running and they‚Äôre my hiking shoes. The Hoka has a nice rocker so that‚Äôs my only con for the VN2‚Äôs being so flat. As a forefoot striker I couldn‚Äôt really tell it was a 10mm drop it just disappeared on my feet. The midsole of Nitro foam with EVA gives a nice cushion that‚Äôs not too plush but still has some responsiveness. The Clifton‚Äôs midsole is quite marshmallow soft feeling (as a heavier runner). Of course the puma grip is Goated. 

If you‚Äôre in NZ or Aus go buy a pair as a daily trainer. I should buy another pair while they‚Äôre on sale before they sell out. Does anyone have the VN3‚Äôs and can compare the VN2‚Äôs against them?",2024-04-11 12:50:46+00:00,21,13
1c1b7dc,PlantarFasciitis,Plantar Fasciitis and Emotional Stress,"I'm wondering if my current experience (and hypothesis) will resonate with anyone here. Soon it will be a year that I've been struggling with this thing. I've been reading a lot about body mind unity lately. 
I've had flat and wide feet all my life, and spent a lot of time dancing and walking for the past 8 years. But now looking back, this thing showed up in my life after a period of tremendous stress occasionated by my family. Concretely, after getting massively disrespected and run over by my brother. And by parents that didn't know how to handle the situation.

My first approach to the issue, was (per doctor's recommendation of course) to use insoles and switch to wide cushy Hoka sneakers and some physical therapy. It provided some short term improvement, but the pain never really went away. These past few months, I've been quite stressed (I haven't been able to get over what my brother did to me yet), and the pain is at the worst it has ever been basically.

I'm doing better and more comprehensive physical therapy now. But, critically, I'm also starting to arrive to the conclusion that it's all tied to this emotional stress.  I'm going to start MBSR soon with some healthy optimism that it will provide me the techniques to handle my emotions better, which may be the key to my chronic pain struggles. I'm really curious to hear if this emotional stress root cause relates to anyone's experience with plantar fasciitis at all. Thanks for reading!",2024-04-11 09:57:36+00:00,7,18
1c15f4v,RunningShoeGeeks,AlphaFly 3 First Run,"Context: 41M, 64kg, short stride length, high cadence 2:29 marathoner. Always used AlphaFly 1 for marathons and struggled to find a replacement I thought was anywhere near as good. Reluctantly paid a bit over the odds for these on eBay but it‚Äôs London next week and didn‚Äôt want to be messing about trying to snag a pair before today‚Äôs drop sells out in 30 seconds. My last pair of Alpha 1 are terminally ill.

Took these out for the first time yesterday, couple of miles easy warm up, a few strides then a few miles at marathon pace. 

The thing I wanted most from these is that massive pop you get in the Alpha 1 and to tell you the truth I  was disappointed, as it‚Äôs just not there. But, the further I got into the run the more I realised this is a totally different shoe and it delivers in a totally different way. 

Gone is that ‚Äòspring‚Äô sensation off the forefoot and in is a very noticeable rocker and an incredibly complimentary pop from what feels like the middle of the foot under the arch.

If you land up over the rocker then this shoe won‚Äôt do much for you. If you land mid-foot and transition through the rocker then you really can feel how much it gives you. If you bound along with large strides on the forefoot then this probably isn‚Äôt for you. For higher cadence mid foot strikers like myself then it‚Äôs ideal.

If I had to pick a shoe to compare its ride to, bizarrely I would say it feels a bit like the OG Hoka Carbon X, just with a much softer and propulsive midsole.

Too early to say if I‚Äôll end up preferring it to the AF1, but initial signs are good. It‚Äôs certainly a lot more comfortable and noticeably lighter. Would definitely recommend sizing up half a size for length. I‚Äôm a UK 10 in everything but these are 10.5 and fit spot on. Initial reservation is mainly that midsole durability might be questionable. Time will tell. ",2024-04-11 03:49:52+00:00,103,17

1c0niae,Marathon_Training,First time Marathon Training.,"A bit of background on me, I (32/M/105Kg) started running about a year ago and on Sunday I completed my first half marathon (London Landmarks) after completing the Runna programme.  During my training I was encouraged by a couple of people I met in Tokyo who just completed the Tokyo Marathon to sign up for NYC Marathon which I've been very fortunate to be selected first time. 

I really hit the wall during my half marathon at 20k and struggled with energy and my heart rate spiking until the end, I felt super prepared and was a little gutted I missed my target time of 2:35 by  75 seconds.  The struggle at the end of the half marathon has made me wonder if my training plan for the next 200ish days is really right, I know I need to work on my fuelling and hoping to lose another 10Kg by race day but I'm looking for some guidance on my plan below. 

**Running Millage:**

Recovery - I'm currently following Runna's 3 week recovery plan, 6K , 19k and then 32k week. 

Pre-Marthon Maintenance - I'm going to move onto Runna's  7 week maintenance plan with 4 runs per week totally between 30 and 40k each week.

Marathon Training - I'm looking at runna's 20 week plan starting 17th June, this will be 4 days of running per week. 

**Cross Training:**

I'm not sure what to do for cross training, I want to add back into my schedule some Yin Yoga for both the stretching but also its good for my mental health. 

I've heard adding in one to two sessions of weight training is useful, especially focusing on single leg exercises but I'm concerned that adding more than one session means I'll end up either running or at the gym every day. while the commitment isn't an issue I'd be concerned about burnout/increased risk of injury. 

**Shoes:**

I don't know what to do here and maybe not specific to the sub-reddit but any advice is welcome on if a shoe rotation is worth it. I over pronate so currently run in the Hoka Arahi 7 (Love)  and in the past Mizuno Wave Equate 7 (Felt like it lacked cushion on longer runs). ",2024-04-10 14:53:32+00:00,3,2
1c0cc2k,bunions,Shoe suggestions after surgery?,"I had a lapidus procedure about 4 months ago on 11/29.

1c0bk2i,Marathon_Training,"2 Weeks Out, a Question","Long time first time, thanks to this community for the inspiration and support. 

I‚Äôm two weeks out from my first marathon after never running more than 6mi my entire life. I‚Äôve mostly been a track/middle distance runner. So, I decided to stretch it out to prove I could do it, mentally if anything. 

I‚Äôve been ramping up to 35-40 miles a week towards my peak, hitting 16, 17, 19 milers. Then, around peak weak I felt pretty drained and broke the 20 into a 7 and 13 back to back days. 

As I‚Äôm now tapering I feel out of sorts. Knees down get pretty fatigued early in recovery runs, I feel sore despite my cardio level being great, and it feels like my form is more pounding/plodding than gliding.

1bzn3rt,XXRunning,Reviews on Hoka biker shorts? ,"Hello all, I'm desperately looking for a short to run my long runs this summer. I have a few hot hots and track that from Lululemon that I really love, but I still end up having some chafing issues when I run close to 10K with them. I'd like to try a biker short for my long run, but haven't really found my holy grail. I tried the fast and free biker shorts. They were good at first, but they got loose somehow which results in me pulling the legs my entire run. Other bike shorts were not super convincing either (like Under Armour or Nike; most rolling up or being too tight around my legs). I ordered the Novafly Short print from Hoka and just received it. And it seems really good - but before pulling the labels, I was wondering if anyone has any review on this short or have any recommendation?

Normally I run in Prime X Strung V1, Superblasts, Invincible 3‚Äôs, and race in AF2‚Äôs/VF 2‚Äôs

I bought these for $120 + tax at Dick‚Äôs Sporting Goods with a coupon after trying on a 10.5 in the blue and yellow colorway earlier at a local running store. I‚Äôve been looking for a new shoe to fill the role as ‚Äúdaily trainer‚Äù but hate a lot of the hyped up ones like NB3, peg 40, Velocity Nitro etc. 

First things first, these are fire lol. 75% of my want for this shoe was because of how good they look, the other 25% wanting a shoe to replace my invincible 3‚Äôs for easier casual runs. After reading about the PEBA blend and the lightweight but still feeling propulsive and quick, I tried them on in a size 10.5 head to head with the Endorphin speed 4 and I loved the feel underfoot - cushioned enough to hit mileage in but not so overly padded. I jogged up and down the sidewalk in them and they felt super natural and again, so lightweight. They didn‚Äôt have my size and the 10.5 were a tad bit roomier than I wanted (the toebox is def roomy) but I found the size 10‚Äôs in store at a local Dicks and picked them up a few hours later. 

First run - took them out this morning for a general 7 miles on my normal route and immediately noticed how easy it was to maintain a quicker pace (I shoot for 8:30ish on any given daily run) and the cushion felt great for such a lightweight shoe. They remind me of my streakflys but with more stack height honestly, basically how I wish the streakflys would feel. Very stable as well. The upper is flawless, no special lacing needed, lockdown was fine off the bat. I like these waaay more than the SC trainer v2, the Hoka Mach X, and the DN2 - all plated super trainers that I wanted to love but couldn‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt really explain it, they just feel awesome. It‚Äôs a special shoe and it‚Äôs getting a lot of great reviews so I figured I‚Äôd throw my first impression in especially since these are such an economically friendly shoe. They really don‚Äôt feel like $140 shoes (or $120 if you use the $20 coupon for signing up for Dick‚Äôs text alerts) 

 I would say If you‚Äôre thinking about it, def try them lol",2024-04-08 21:55:36+00:00,97,64

I have an over-pronation problem on my left foot so I have to use stability shoes to correct my step landing. So far the ones that worked for me are Hoka Arahi6. But they get wet very easily.

Hoka has hiking shoes too, but they are not catered to the audience who need stability. I also tried the separate insole on regular hiking shoes, but they are uncomfortable because of the additional weight and increased height.

I am looking for recommendations for,

\- hiking shoes,

\- which are waterproof/ at least water repellent

1by6cmq,sesamoid,6 month post sesamoidectomy check in,"Hello! long time no see! Here, as promised, is my 6 month check in post left medial sesamoidectomy. I had a medial incision, under general anesthetic. I‚Äôm posting this just to add to the catalogue of sesamoidectomy experiences. There‚Äôs some advice in there, but I think your healing journey is mainly luck at the end of the day, and I‚Äôve been lucky in some ways, and unlucky in others. Best wishes to anyone having sesamoid issues, you‚Äôre not alone. Please see my previous posts for other sesamoiditis resources, and comprehensive operation planning checklists.

**6 months post-op (March 2024)**

I went on a remote working holiday with friends, in a beautiful natural location. Just like the singing trip in Feb, having external goals and friends around meant I naturally started to push my walking abilities, and discover I could do more than I thought.

I am able to, in hokas:

* Do pretty much unlimited day to day walking! (e.g around the house, the supermarket)
* Go on rugged terrain hikes of up to 4+ hours (with breaks, carrying no pack)
* Climb rock walls that have large jugs, i.e don‚Äôt require bearing weight on a single flexed foot

I am able to, in altras:

* Do pretty much all calisthenics moves I used to do (e.g planks, squats without weight, rows)
* Do small amounts of hip hop

I am able to, barefoot:

* walk small distances on sand
* Walk around the house

I can‚Äôt yet:

* walk for over 30 minutes in shoes other than hokas (e.g altras), I still really need the rocker sole bottom. Sand is especially difficult.
* do full push ups on rings, it puts too much weight on my flexed toes
* sprint

**5 months post-op (February 2024)**

The trip to do gigs was a massive confidence boost. I was ‚Äúforced‚Äù to walk and carry things as part of the trip, and I realized I could do a lot more than I thought. I think for sure the past 3 months I could have been doing a lot more rehab and exercise.

I am able to, in hokas:

* Go camping mostly independently  - i.e can drive to the campsite, and walk over 100m carrying my tent and pack, set up camp
* Walk all day on flat terrain
* do small amounts of running after a toddler : )
* Stand for hours as part of choir rehearsals and performances

**4 months post-op (January 2024)**

There was a family crises at Christmas, and that combined with the past few months of a few major issues meant I didn‚Äôt put as much attention into rehab and exercise yet again, I was feeling pretty exhausted. But in better news, I was also mentally busy preparing for a few singing performances, which involved a week of travel in Feb.

I am able to, in hokas:

* Do a major full day bike ride, battling the wind the whole way! (this was my first major day of outdoor exercise a friend invited me on. It was so nice to have that support)

**3 months post-op (December 2023)**

* I stopped using crutches at all around Christmas! This month I started getting my confidence back walking.
* I also got a new job, which was a massive relief. Probably due to that reduced mental load, I finally booked in my first physio session, which was incredibly helpful

I am able to, in hokas:

* walk around a mall
* Walk across an airport carrying a 10kg backpack
* I probably could have gone for small exercise walks of 30 min, but I was still a bit scared of pushing myself

I am able to, barefoot:

* walk around the house

I can‚Äôt yet:

* Feel super confident walking all day, my foot gets sore and tired
* Feel confident enough to swim in the sea, I was daunted by walking on uneven terrain, standing on rocks, kicking with my foot on a flipper
* Walk more than a tiny distance on sand

**2 months post-op (November 2023)**

* got made redundant! argh! I couldn‚Äôt believe that in under two months I had a major operation, a close family member got cancer, and I lost my job.
* The energy I put into job hunting, and traveling to visit my relative, reduced my attention to rehab and healing.
* I didn‚Äôt do any active rehab at this time. The attempts I did do felt too sore - though in hindsight I think a good professional could have come up with ideas to adapt the exercises I already knew.
* A continuing struggle I‚Äôve had is that I want to save my foot strength for walking and living, rather than isolated exercises. But I do know the exercises are super important for restoring balanced, healthy function, rather than setting up bad muscular and postural habits. But at his point, there was too going on for me to have that be a focus.
* I went on a holiday with friends, and felt pretty sad that I couldn‚Äôt join them on many outings, due to my reduced walking ability (though in hindsight, maybe I actually could have done more than I thought)
* I definitely could have been biking and swimming by now, but had fallen out of the habit of exercise

**1 month post-op (October 2023)**

* stitches got removed at 2 weeks post op, which was a relief, it made weight bearing less painful
* so much dry flaky skin around the incision! I found a bit of exfoliation, and rubbing it with QV cream improved the skin.
* using crutches a lot, and the knee scooter for longer distances. However knee pain does build up from kneeling after a while
* no issues at all with my remote desk job
* I spent most of this month, and the next, on trips to another city to visit a relative undergoing cancer treatment in another city
* very little pain and swelling
* able to drive my automatic car without issues
* By Halloween I went to a party with an elaborate costume, and spent the whole night standing and walking around in hokas!

**1 week post-op**

* My post op instructions were to weight bear as soon as possible. At day 3 I started putting some weight on the foot, just for a few gentle steps, it was pretty sore
* a Dr friend had warned me that operations make you unexpectedly exhausted for at least a week, I found this to be the case for me. I had such little energy, just learning a new embroidery technique to mend a wool jumper took me days, and I had to take many breaks. The one day I went in the car to visit extended family was such a huge deal, it took the rest of the day to recover.
* having a knee scooter was fantastic, it made it so easy to get to the bathroom at night in particular, and generally getting around the house with very low effort
* I kept my foot elevated a lot with an elevation pillow
* showering was pretty easy with the set up I had, a plastic chair in the shower with a wooden plant pot holder to prop my foot to the side on
* the pain was a 7/10 at it‚Äôs worst, but that only happened one night. I took a single opiate the entire time, the rest of the time I managed pain with paracetamol, and small amounts of cbd oil
* I had my parents cooking every meal for me
* I went back to my work at a computer 11 days after, and I had no issues working full days, but I did work 3 days a week.
* I returned to my house (which is up 85 stairs!) on day 7. I could cook for myself using the knee scooter and iwalk.
* My foot was slightly swollen, but not majorly so

**September 20th, Operation day!**

In conclusion, my fear of the operation was way worse than my actual experience, it all went pretty smoothly for me, and was never painful.

* woke up 6:00 am, my partner drove me to the hospital
* was seen by a nurse to do all the pre op forms
* got undressed, put in a hospital gown, and was put in a ‚Äúbair hugger‚Äù to stay warm. I signed the last consent forms in bed.
* I was not able to get a premed due to the time between singing the consent form and the operation, it wouldn‚Äôt have taken effect.
* My partner was able to stay with me until the last moment I went into theater
* The theater was such a surreal experience, just like a TV show, all white with people in gowns hurrying around.
* I got on the bed, had IV general anesthetic put in, and don‚Äôt even remember going to sleep
* the next time I was conscious I was in the surgery recovery room, someone had put my glasses on for me!
* the nurse forgot to put a basin next to my bed, I threw up on the blankets. I normally, like most people, hate throwing up, but honestly it was all quite hilarious to me at the time. I was pleasantly high from the anesthetic! This high lasted the rest of the day for me
* my partner arrived, I was offered food, but I still felt a bit sick, so just drank a cup of sweet tea
* I had absolutely no pain at all, thanks to local anesthetic that was injected while I was asleep
* I was given a gauze bandage on my foot, my toe was immobilized with tape. I was offered a hoka shoe, but had come prepared with my own homemade one made out of a roman sandal, with a matching platform bottom so I could walk evenly (it was crafted by my partner, will post pictures)
* My partner drove me home to my parents. In the car I got super hungry and ate a whole packet of ginger candy
* When I got to my parents house I also had a hearty dinner, watched a show, and ate all of the exciting snacks my sister had bought me, so I had quite an appetite.
* When I fell asleep I had no pain, local anesthetic still going strong!

**September 19th, day before operation**

* I was super scared and stressed
* I ended up finishing work an hour early so I could book an hour massage to help me calm down
* I finalized packing for the hospital e.g my filled out forms, loose comfortable clothing, setting out my glasses to wear (instead of contacts)
* had a high fat meal at 9pm (sausages), and my last drink of water, went to bed about 10:30pm

**Pre operation**

* Even swimming caused my foot to swell up the next day (this was the unusual symptom that caused my physio to refer me to a sports dr, which eventually lead me to getting an MRI and discovering the necrosed sesamoid)
* I limited my walking to under 30 min to avoid soreness and swelling the next day. I could have probably done more, but I was very conscious of not wanting to develop further injuries by walking with altered posture, e.g loading the outside of my foot, limping e.t.c
* I could bike by putting my foot further forward on the pedal to avoid the sesamoid area, I bought an exercise bike that I wish I used more, I could have been way fitter pre operation! But it took me a long time to adapt to my new reality. I hope next time I have an injury/age, I will focus more on what I can do, and adapt, rather than get depressed.
* I started working on my lifelong wonky shoulder alignment - this was a totally separate issue, but meant I was limited from many non foot weight bearing exercises like pull ups, planks e.t.c. I was kind of forced to prioritize it, since I knew shoulder weight bearing exercises would be the only ones I would be capable of for a while",2024-04-07 14:53:18+00:00,19,7
1bxz44w,PlantarFasciitis,Continued Heel Pain after wearing bad shoes for one day at work - Please Help!,"Basically the title. Two different pairs of shoes of mine got wet due to a very rainy weekend, so I had to bust out an old pair of shoes meant for trail running and wear them to work since I was all out of shoes.

I wore them for the whole 8 hour shift at work and halfway through the shift, the back of my heels were super sore. It‚Äôs been a few weeks now and yet I still have that back of heel pain.

What can I do to make this pain stop? I feel like it‚Äôs improving possibly but I‚Äôm surprised it‚Äôs gone on this long.

FYI: My regular shoes are some New Balances (I forget the specific one but they are meant to be similar to Hokas), skechers with arch support, and some super puffy house shoes. These shoes are great and never give me pain but since I injured my heel all of them make me a little sore after a long while (not as bad as the other shoes).",2024-04-07 08:06:34+00:00,5,2

I've read about the Hokas, but I can't really afford them right now, especially when I spent so much on the shoes (two pairs of NewBalance 990s) I have right now which are still good and have replaceable insoles.

1bwrat9,trailrunning,Hoka question,"I just purchased my first pair of hokas (Speedgoat 5) and after giving them a try I am noticing blisters on the arches of both feet. This has never happened to me before. I really do like the stability of the shoe since I am prone to rolling my ankles. I really don't think it's possible to roll my ankles in these! I have wider feet, but have never had to purchase a wide shoe. It does seem like these hokas run more narrow than the typical shoes I wear. I am considering exchanging my current shoes for the wide version.

My question: to those who have worn hokas, have you noticed they tend to be more narrow? Have any of you had to purchase wide instead?

Also, yes I know we all have different types of feet. I wish just curious to know if others have noticed something similar.",2024-04-05 19:52:12+00:00,7,15
1bwle4b,RunningShoeGeeks,First run in Puma Deviate Nitro 2 bought for $40 - slow runner edition,"Like others have, I found a pair for $40 at Ross but 1/2 size bigger than my usual which concerned me but I just couldn‚Äôt pass up this deal.

ABOUT ME: 54 male 5‚Äô9‚Äù tall 170 lbs, have run a couple half marathons with a PR of 2:03 hoping to run a full one day.

CURRENTLY TRAINING FOR: a 5K/10-miler weekend 6 weeks from now.

CURRENT SHOE ROTATION: Ghost Max & Invincible 3 for easy/recovery, Mach 5 & Speed 2 for uptempo/fartlek/strides, Glideride 3 for long runs, Vaporfly 2 for races.

WHAT I RAN FOR FIRST RUN: 5k at easy zone 2 and 1 mile of strides at mile race pace at the end.

FIT - This worried me the most since the shoes are half a size bigger than my normal 8.5 but surprisingly couldn‚Äôt tell the diff during my run. Probably need more miles to see if it truly is not going to be an issue. I always do a runner‚Äôs knot on all my shoes so heel lock was good (better than invincible 3 even at 1/2 a size bigger). These must run narrower cause I think my feet would‚Äôve been really snug if I had it in my normal size. BUT what‚Äôs up with shoe companies putting stretchy laces on running shoes (my Ghost Max also has stretchy laces)? Dislike.

FEEL DURING RUN - I know people really like these shoes but they are stiff (especially at toe-off) at my 11:00 per mile easy run pace‚Ä¶or maybe I‚Äôve just been spoiled by my Ghost Max and Invincible 3 at this pace. I‚Äôm a mid to forefoot striker and they just feel stiff, maybe it‚Äôll feel better after a few miles of breakin? However, they felt much better when I did my strides for my last mile at about a  6:30-7:30 per mile pace during those 30 sec intervals. Toe off felt better and the shoe felt snappy.

OUTSOLE : Puma grip, ‚Äònuff said! These will def be my run in the rain/snow shoes.

Overall FOR ME these are just ok and will do their job at the upper paces. Definitely not for slow runners but they will replace my Mach 5 and Speed 2 (both of which are near their end of life) for workouts; feel-wise these 2 shoes are better than the Pumas.

The greatest thing about them is that they were only 40 freakin dollars! I would‚Äôve been really disappointed if I bought them at the normal $160 price but go $40 this will be a fine addition to my rotation. I think I‚Äôll race in them for my upcoming 5k just to see how it goes but definitely will not race in them for the 10-miler.

BTW I went to 3 Ross locations before I found this in the size 9. The first Ross had a 2 Puma Forever Run not in my size, the second Ross had a Hoka Gaviota 4 for $70, and the third is where I found the Deviate and they had 3 other Deviates in other sizes. So there still might be some out there if you want to go hunting for them.

1bw70wn,PlantarFasciitis,Hoka changed my pain levels,"Hey all, long time lurker, felt the need to post so any future search could land here with some helpful info. I know this issue is not a blanket fix for all, but I thought I‚Äôd chime in with what helped me. 

I work 12 hour shifts on my feet in my Hoka bondi 8‚Äôs, and it‚Äôs a complete turn around to anything i was using at work before (different styles of ASICS or crocs)
I was still running into that issue of coming home and resting for even just a little while, and having debilitating pain getting back up again, whether a few minutes on the couch or a night in bed. 

I went to REI and tried on oofas, glad i did because reviews online are very mixed. It was way too soft and little to no form to it for me. Then, i tried the Hoka recovery slides and just the test walk in the store, i knew it was the right solution. 

Now i wear them when i get up in the morning, walking around the house, etc, and my pain in both my feet is either so dull i hardly notice it, or not there at all. It‚Äôs been a total game changer to getting my life and energy back. 

So that‚Äôs my two cents :)

1bvuuor,RunningShoeGeeks,Rebel v4 vs Mach 6,"First run comparison between the Rebel v4 and Mach 6. I received both on Wednesday, took the Rebel out first on Thursday, then the Mach out this morning (Friday).

Why did I get both? Upgrading from the Rebel v3 and Mach 5 which are both at the end of their working lives.

What will I use them for? Initial thoughts are Rebel for easy/long runs and the Mach for easy/tempo/fartlek runs.

My first runs in both were easy runs (5min/km) for 10-12km.

I weighed both when I took them out of the box - both in US 10.5 - the Rebel v4 weighed 215g/223g L/R and the Mach 6 weighed 245g L/R.

FIRST RUN IMPRESSIONS

FIT
Rebel v4 - spacious! I have lower volume feet and this thing is big, but not in a bad way. I had no trouble with securing my feet or slippage. I always use the runners knot btw.

Mach 6 - I've seen reviews stating it doesn't have a large toe box, but compared to the Mach 5,  it seems the 6 has slightly more room throughout. No trouble here.

FEEL - Upper
Rebel v4 - like it doesn't exist! Honestly, this was like running on the sole with a minimal/paper thin upper.

Mach 6 - more like a traditional daily trainer. You could tell it was there.

FEEL - Midsole (easy run only remember...)
Rebel v4 - quite firm in comparison to the Rebel v3, but I liked it. The main thing I noticed was the weight - so damn light!

Mach 6 - Firm but responsive, kind of like a toned down Rebel v3. I felt like I was running on a ton on stack height compared to the Rebel v4 - I know it's only a few mm difference but it felt significant. However this didn't create any issues for me.

VERDICT
Similar shoes which I both like! I'll use them both for easy/fartlek/tempo/long runs and come back with a 200km comparison review üôÇ",2024-04-04 18:34:45+00:00,147,46

So I ran for a long time in Clifton 8s... 5k, 10k, half marathons. I sadly ran out of my last pair (9 wide) and decided to give the Clifton 9 a try. Tried both the wide and the regular. It went from being exactly right under my foot to causing serious discomfort in my feet... some heel pain as well, which I've never had. Nothing else has changed, weight the same, etc. I went for a trail run in my regular trail shoes and had zero issues, so I don't think there's an injury going on.

I figured if anyone would know good recommendations, it would be this sub! I have a bunch of foot problems and I need to buy really cushioned shoes. I'm kinda tired of the runner vibes they give off though, and was hoping to find some good looking sneakers (Think Adida's Originals, Vans, Nike Air Max 90 etc.) that might have super comfy soles.

So far, New balance fresh foam and Hoka's have done me solid. But again, not loving the runner vibes and hoka's are just kinda ugly LOL.

Anyone have any good recommendations for a nice sneaker, under $200, that is comfortable walking all day? I really really would prefer a foam soled shoe. I know they rough up easy, but with those I can be out 10 hours with like one maybe two breaks. Rubber soles, even with inserts, I would need like 3 or 4 breaks or possibly even to just chill for an hour somewhere before continuing and take some OTC pain meds.

&#x200B;

I'm looking for some trail runners. These will be worn almost every single day this summer. I aim to backpack down to the Pyrenees from the UK, do various short hikes around Chamonix in late July, complete a section hike of the Pyrenees (< 2 weeks, not sure where yet!) in early August, and continue travelling to see the sites of European cities and nature.

&#x200B;

Ideally they will be highly **breathable** to take the fairly dry climate of the Pyrenees, **3-6mm drop**, **durable** (to take the majority of their wear on tarmac around cities), **wide toe box**, **moderately-cushioned**, **lightweight** (ideally < 285g per shoe).

Any recommendations for any particular shoes? Equally, any details about trail running in the Pyrenees would be appreciated! We'd likely take a mishmash of the GR10, GR11 and the Haute Route. If anyone has any experience with the shoes listed below they'd be willing to share, that would be most appreciated!

* Any Topo shoes
* Hoka Speedgoat 5 (Wide Version)
* Saucony Peregrine 12

1brysht,walking,Durable shoes for 100k+ step endurance walks and daily wear?,"Honestly would like to use them for trail/road running as well but it seems such criteria would be fit for a pair of unicorns.

Me and a friend of mine enjoy a 50 mile/80 km walk together a few times a year. My old worn out impressively dilapidated Asics Gel Trabuco 7s need to be replaced. On top of looking too much like swiss cheese with all the holes and perhaps sun-dried Limberger, and having mangled heel cups snd some missing bits (I've had  chunks of open cell foam come out of the holes at the ankles, and chunks of the heel cup slip out), their toe boxes are a bit too small for me. A few 80km walks informed me of this quite well.

Oher than fit/comfort, I'm looking for durability above all else. Hoka and Altra are available in my area but I'm unsure of Altra's durabilty and I will need to try on the Hokas to see if i like the stacked cushioning. I ""grew up"" running with Brooks so I could get Brooks and be safe, but I think i should get those for when I go running...

For durabilty I've been looking at Inov-8 and Salomon, and Merrel. Merrel is easy to get here in Korea but Salomon and Inov-8 i might have to order blindly online... Does anyone have any input on those brands?

Thanks for the input folks, happy walking!",2024-03-31 01:52:58+00:00,5,2

1bpysbv,walking,"I bought a pair of Hoka running shoes for an upcoming trip, but they hurt a lot! Should I give up on them?","Hi!  
To avoid having tired feet while walking a lot in an upcoming city trip, after some internet research I bought a pair of Hoka Clifton 9.  
  
Now, I am not a runner, nor someone that walks a lot, but even compared to my (probably really bad for walking) Air Jordan, I hurt a lot when walking with the cliftons.  
  
I wore them for a while so I assume they are broken in, what I experience is:  
\- Achille's tendon pain.  
\- Knee pain  
\- At times shin pain.  
\- Slight metatarsal pain.  
  
All the above don't usually happen when I walk with sneakers, though they are really badly cushioned so my feet get sore fairly soon.  
  
Before I give up on them, do you have any potential suggestion I could try? I have a fairly narrow foot and a somewhat standard arch. I sometime have the bad tendency of having the foot lean on one side while walking. Admittedly, I probably have an horrible walking posture, but this is not something I can fix in the short amount of time I have left, though I really look forward improving that in the near future!  
  
I am considering buying good insoles (eyeing superfeet ones) at the very least to put them in Jordans and walk with them, but would that help with the Hokas?  
  
Sorry if this is not a post proper for the this subreddit :-)  
Thank you!

1bmcui2,trailrunning,Need Advice: Elevating My Trail Running for the Mt. Si. Vert Challenge,"I'm a 47M who tackled four half marathons last year and am now setting my sights on a new challenge, the [Mt. Si. Vert] (https://ultrasignup.com/register.aspx?did=110834). This 17K race boasts a daunting 3,500‚Äô of vertical gain, and it's a whole different beast compared to what I'm accustomed to. I took the course for a test run recently, clocking in at 210 minutes. My goal is ambitious: I aim to cut that time nearly in half to under 120 minutes by race day in September, six months from now. My half marathon pace is roughly 7:30 per mile. 

I'm here seeking your wisdom on two fronts:

1. **Shoes for Trail Running:** I ran with Hoka Speedgoats, but I'm considering a switch for race day, perhaps to something lighter that still offers protection against the rocky sections I'll face. Any recommendations? Specifics on shoe brands/models to consider with a strike plate would be incredibly helpful. I don‚Äôt know anything about trail running shoes. 

2. **Training Adjustments:** My usual regimen for half marathons includes running three times a week, with a mix of tempo, interval, and long slow distance (8-12 miles) runs - total of 20-25 miles per week. Given the unique demands of the Mt. Si. Vert, how should I adjust my training? Are there particular workouts, drills, or strategies that could help me prepare, especially to improve my climbing endurance and speed?

1bk6bee,hyrox,A few questions (first Hyrox),"So I‚Äôm doing the NYC Hyrox in June, and I‚Äôd appreciate some feedback / answers if anyone‚Äôs got some. Also fully recognize that I‚Äôm overthinking some aspects (I always do) so if the best advice is just ‚Äúman stfu and go for it, you‚Äôll be fine‚Äù then that works great too. 

1) Shoes! Is it better to opt for a more metcon-style shoe that‚Äôs best for the individual workout stations, and then suck it up a bit on the runs, or to wear running shoes and just accept that stuff like sled pushes are going to be a little tougher? I‚Äôve got Saucony endorphin 3s, Hoka Clifton 9s, and a pair of Strike movement trainers that are basically cross trainers. 

2) ski erg. How hard is this station? I don‚Äôt have access to one, so I won‚Äôt be able to practice with any real specificity. Best I can do is simulate one with resistance bands looped over a pullup bar - should I worry much about this, or just go into it cold and accept that I‚Äôll add a couple minutes to my time? 

3) General pacing. Fortunately I have a background in both powerlifting and distance running, so I‚Äôm not TOO concerned with any individual aspect. My rough plan is to crush the sled push / pull / runs, since that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm most comfortable with, then cruise through less familiar stations at whatever pace feels like it‚Äôs not going to absolutely cook me. Does this seem reasonable, or is it best to conserve energy all around and just make sure I don‚Äôt burn out?

Appreciate any feedback in advanceüëåüèªnever done any kind of CrossFit / circuit training, so I‚Äôm excited to give this a shot! 

EDIT: Huge thank you to everyone who chimed in, I really appreciate it. Sauconys it is, won‚Äôt go too hard on the sleds, and will try to test a ski erg - if I can‚Äôt find one, I‚Äôll find a comfortable pace and make up time on some of the runs. Looking forward to it!

So, I'm curious if there is hope in finding a cushioned shoe that also offers the nimbleness I seek, like the cadillac coupe or trail runners.  Is cushioning and responsiveness a straight, one-to-one trade-off, or are there other features I should be looking for that could lend a bit of assurance on more technical sections?

It weighs 3.45lbs and does not have a built in rain cover. 

We are looking at Osprey Sirrus 24L (2.73 lbs), Osprey Sirrus 34L (3 lbs), and Osprey Hikelite 32L (2.18lbs) packs since they all can use the water bladder we already own and are about the right size.

We're aware of the need to pack light.  Her packing list is as follows (more or less):

2 x merino wool tshirts

1x merino wool thin (150g) hoodie

I guess our questions are about pack size & weight: should she consider going with her existing 46L pack despite its extra size and weight (3.45lbs), or should we try to find something smaller and lighter?  The lightest option is 2.18lbs (with a built in rain cover).  Is a little over a pound really going to make that huge of a difference? If so, what size pack  is likely to be a good fit for her packing list?

FWIW, she plans to have a bag service carry her bags ahead for the first few days going uphill into the mountains.

I guess our questions are about pack size & weight: should she consider going with her existing 46L pack despite its extra size and weight (3.45lbs), or should we try to find something smaller and lighter?  The lightest option is 2.18lbs (with a built in rain cover).  Is a little over a pound really going to make that huge of a difference? If so, what size pack  is likely to be a good fit for her packing list?

FWIW, she plans to have a bag service carry her bags ahead for the first few days going uphill into the mountains.

Thanks!

1bghzt5,CaminoDeSantiago,Backpack question,"My wife is (50f) will be walking 16 days of Camino Franc√©s in May (between St Jean and Burgos) between 8 and 21 May of this year.  I'm trying to help her plan and outfit herself (despite never having walked the Camino myself) and we have a backpack question: she owns an Osprey Porter 46 already, but it sounds like it's larger and heavier than the ideal.  It weighs 3.45lbs and does not have a built in rain cover. 

We are looking at Osprey Sirrus 24L (2.73 lbs), Osprey Sirrus 34L (3 lbs), and Osprey Hikelite 32L (2.18lbs) packs since they all can use the water bladder we already own and are about the right size.

We're aware of the need to pack light.  Her packing list is as follows (more or less):

Backpack

Silk sleep sack

Micro towel

Shoes (Hoka Speedgoat 5)

2 x leggings

2 x merino wool tshirts

1x merino wool thin (150g) hoodie

2x socks (Wrightsocks double layer)

2x Underwear

2x Bras

1x hooded fleece

1x Rain jacket

1x Buff

1x Baseball hat / sun hat

Emergency ponchos

Trekking pole (get in France)

Chums wallet

Phone Charger/cord & battery

Sunglasses

Gallon ziplock bags & laundry bag 

Lamb's wool

Carabiner

Sleep mask & ear plugs

Toiletries (small hairbrush, toothbrush, etc.)

Toothpaste tablets

Chapstick

Vaseline

Portawipes / coin towels (she has Crohn's so emergency wipes are a requirement)

Sunscreen puck

Deodorant

Soap bar & case

Day pack?

1bfoxzq,PlantarFasciitis,Alternatives to the New Balance 410 V7 Running Shoe?,"I've tried lots of shoes for my PF over the years but the one that's worked the best has been the New Balance 410 V7 Running Shoe. It was almost magical. My pf seemed to completely disappear once I started wearing them. And this is after trying Hokas and so many other brands that were supposedly good for PF! 

So now I just went to buy a new pair and it looks like they've been phased out or discontinued! 

Does anybody who's had similar luck with that shoe have recommendations on what to go to next?  Is there another New Balance style which is similar or the same?

1besgan,walking,Abandoning Altra for Hoka/Asics?,"Maybe two years ago, I made the switch to Altra Lone peaks/Torin (zero drop shoes but with some cushioning). I bought into the fact that they were supposed to be more ""natural"". Since then, or around then (so obviously not 100% sure that they are the cause), I've felt pain in my lower back and sometimes in my knees after going on long-ish walks.

Overall I'm in great shape, workout and usually walk a lot. I know I'm a heavy heel striker (and I like to walk quickly/""forcefully"") and I'm afraid that the flat sole doesn't help me enough and that the zero drop will eventually turn into a negative drop due to compression of the cushioning.

Lately I've been looking into buying another pair of ""normal"" shoes to try and see if my problems will alleviate. The main contenders are the Hoka Bondi 8, or the Asics Nimbus 26. Since both of these are quite expensive, I want to check around and see what people think of them.

I've tried both in the store and they seem to fit fine, but I can't actually know how they feel after longer use.

Reading that I'm a heavy heel striker will perhaps make someone recommend one over the other.

Me and my back would appreciate any help.",2024-03-14 18:38:28+00:00,2,7

I use medical cannabis to help my persistent anxiety and insomnia along with my IBS. The edibles help take the edge of the PF pain too. But I recently purchased a balm from my dispensary that is CBD dominant but does have THC. I just applied it and I'll see how I feel in the morning.

1b6qc9f,PlantarFasciitis,dry needling cured my PF?,"TLDR; i tried almost everything from PF with very little improvement. i did 1 session of dry needling almost a week ago and my PF symptoms have since improved 80-100%. kinesiology tape also decreased my symptoms drastically. scroll to the bottom for what i tried and what i think was actually helpful. 

i know there‚Äôs lots of opinions and information in this sub, but i think reading what worked for lots of different people is so helpful so i wanted to share this. 

i‚Äôve been dealing with PF in my left foot since the end of 2022/beginning of 2023. i believe the cause of my PF was doing HIIT workouts barefoot on the concrete floors of my apartment‚Ä¶ in hindsight very dumb. im a nurse and am on my feet for 12hrs a day when working.  i immediately began working with a physiotherapist when i realized what was going on. we did stretches and strengthen exercises and i saw very little if any improvement. a few months in (about May 2023) i saw a podiatrist who did some testing and confirmed i had PF and recommend custom orthotics, wearing shoes with arch support at all times when standing or walking, resting as much as possible, even more stretching, and a night splint. i also switched to a different physio who specialized in orthopaedic issues, and they gave me different exercises to work on. i followed all these recommendations and saw maybe 30% improvement. i was no longer experiencing pain first thing in the morning, but by the end of the day my foot was at a 7-8/10 on the pain scale. 

in August 2023 i badly broke my left leg and was non-weight bearing for 12 weeks. when i was cleared to walk again i was so excited to find i didn‚Äôt have pain in my foot. i thought i ‚Äúrested‚Äù my PF into healing. of course within 3-4 weeks of relearning how to walk, my PF returned. not as bad as before but still quite painful by the end of the day. i was so demoralized from doing constant physio for the last year and always being in pain. before a big trip i decided to try something i hadn‚Äôt tried but had seen many people post about in here, taping my foot. i used a frequently shared video and KT tape. immediately i felt no pain! i walked around my block and felt no pain. i could have cried. of course when i took the tape off, my foot still hurt and often by the end of the day even with the tape i was sore, but it was vastly improved. taping allowed me to enjoy my trip and experience significantly less pain than i otherwise would have. 

around this time, a friend who had previously dealt with a stubborn calf injury recommended a specific physiotherapist in our city known for his expertise in dry needling. we‚Äôre talking 200+ 5 star reviews, many saying he cured their chronic ailment in 1 session. having tried basically everything else, i thought i‚Äôd give it a shot. i don‚Äôt believe in ‚Äúmiracle cures‚Äù or anything of the sort but this physio was very confident that he could fix my issue. we did probably 15 or so needles in various trigger points from my L5, my glutes and hip, down to my calf and shin, and my foot. it SUCKED. it hurt very badly. the next two days i was sore and achy. but for the last week i have been feeling AMAZING. my pain is improved 80-100% depending on the day. i‚Äôve worked my way back up to 10k steps a day and i am feeling very little pain. i‚Äôm going to continue wearing my orthotics, doing my strengthening and stretching, and wearing my night splint but for the first time in over a year i feel like i might actually be able to get rid of this!!

here‚Äôs a list of things i tried and if i think they helped or not:
- frozen water bottle: temporary relief only 2/10 NOT HELPFUL
- lacrosse ball/spiky ball: temporary relief only 3/10 NOT HELPFUL
- night splint: so uncomfortable at first but really helped to get rid of ‚Äúfirst step‚Äù pain 7/10 HELPFUL
- toe spacers: i already have ‚Äúduck feet‚Äù so these did nothing for me 0/10 NOT HELPFUL
- Dr Scholls heelcups and PF shoe inserts: caused more pain and provided no support 0/10 NOT HELPFUL
- custom orthotics: im still not sure how great these are at helping with my pain but i have very high arches so i definitely need the support 6/10 SOMEWHAT HELPFUL
- hoka bondi 8 running shoes: i dunno if these helped at all but they are comfy 6/10 SOMEWHAT HELPFUL
- birkenstock sandals: work great for my arches 7/10 HELPFUL
- oofos sandals: comfy and supportive but ugly 7/10 HELPFUL
- massage gun on calves and feet: feels good in the moment but i can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs done much 6/10 SOMEWHAT HELPFUL
- calf and foot stretches: i can do all the stretches in the world and not feel any pain relief. i am so mobile but was still experiencing lots of pain 5/10 SOMEWHAT HELPFUL
- stretches before standing up in the morning: warming up helped to avoid pain first thing 7/10 HELPFUL
- ‚Äúalphabets‚Äù after sitting for long periods: im not sure this ever helped me not experiencing pain but again i think to avoid further injury 7/10 HELPFUL
- toe yoga/toes training: i‚Äôve always had mobile/strong toes so i dont think this did much for me, but it didnt hurt 5/10 SOMEWHAT HELPFUL
- rathleff protocol: especially post-break, my calves are weak, so this is essential. my first round i did with both feet down at once. i am part way through a second round and am now able to do one leg at a time 8/10 VERY HELPFUL
- kinesiology tape: treated the symptoms of PF but not the actual PF. allowed me to do things with little to no pain 8/10 VERY HELPFUL
- dry needling: as describe above 9/10 VERY HELPFUL

this is much more long winded than i intended but i hope it helps someone! ps if you live in Vancouver BC and are interested in trying dry needling PM me and i will pass along the physio‚Äôs information.

1b51cs5,Shoes,PSA: From Docs to Crocs the shoe industry is dominated by big finance...and it's not good for your favourite brands.,"BlackRock and Vanguard are top shareholders in almost all popular shoe brands, from Nike to UGGs, Converse, Hoka, Sketchers, Crocs and many more. Other major owners are billionaires, private equity, and venture capital. 

This might not seem relevant to shoes but it is the core reason why the quality of popular footwear brands has gradually been declining for years while workers in far off places are [exploited](https://www.payyourworkers.org/).  

Why all this corner cutting? Because when big finance is in control the first priority is funnelling wealth to investors as fast as possible. 

When it's done gradually with tons of marketing it's harder to notice the change. But it hasn't gone unnoticed on reddit:

1b4v0zl,hiking,any over-pronators tried the Hoka Stinson 7 and like them? Are they similar to Hoka Gaviota (as far as stability goes)?,"I prefer boots over trail runners, but carrying a separate pair of boots and sneakers is getting to be a huge PITA when it comes to traveling. I try to pack as lightly as I can especially for international travel. I am going to buy some trail runners so I can just wear em on the plane and save space in my backpack without taking up half the space on clunky boots.

Anyway, I am a loyalist to the Hoka Gaviota - it's my PERFECT everyday and work shoe. I am a nurse, I'm on my feet all day every day. I need that kind of cushioning. But I also desperately need the high degree of stability. This is the only shoe I've ever found that I don't need to wear an insole with and it corrects my gait perfectly. All the shoes I've tried with a corrective insole just aren't as good as this shoe is on its own! I even used to have very expensive custom insoles and they were not as good as this shoe.

The Hoka Stinson is the only trail runner Hoka markets as a stability shoe. It has a similar type of J frame thing that the Hoka Gaviota has. Due to the fact that I wear a women's 5, i don't have any local options for trying things on, nobody in town carries this size for more niche shoes like this. I will be ordering from zappos since they are pretty good about free returns. I am just going to wear them around the house for a day to try em out (that's about as close as I can get to giving them a whirl without making them too dirty to return. I'd love to be able to take these out on a hike but I know I cannot do that and return them!)

I'm asking here because I didn't get much response in the trail running sub, and the responses I got were pretty opposing - someone told me it is a stability shoe, and someone else told me it is, and that's about it lol. And given that my focus is really more hiking NOT trail running I'm hoping y'all can give me more of an idea.",2024-03-02 18:28:37+00:00,7,5
1b48bdk,trailrunning,Are the Hoka Stinson 7s at all comparable to the Hoka Gaviotas? (Stability wise),"The gaviotas are my perfect everyday shoe, especially their most recent update.

It seems like hoka stimson is rated to also be plush and stable ü§î pretty much all their other trail runners and hiking boots are neutral which is not enough for me. I always end up putting orthotics in their neutral shoes/boots and even then that's not as good as their stability shoes.

Before I drop $170 on these (yes I'll still do somewhere with free returns) can anyone tell me if they have a similar level of stability to the gaviotas? I can't try these on without ordering online. I wear a women's 5 and nowhere in town carries my size in more niche shoes like this.",2024-03-01 22:56:37+00:00,3,13

 I was born with hip dysplasia and I‚Äôm pretty hypermobile. I tend to have a lot of pain in my inner socket especially when I have to stand in one place. Recently, my pain has also been in my sciatic nerve and in general I would describe my lower back as feel compacted? With my feet, I tend to pronate inwards pretty severely. 
I have tried the Hokas Bondis but they are so heavy they make my hips worse and my feet turn in more. If any podiatrist or doctor would like to give me some advice, I would greatly appreciate it. 12 hour shifts can be brutal with pain.

1b2imr5,trailrunning,Re-soling a road shoe to a trail shoe.,"So I suspect a lot of people are going to shoot this idea down, but I've been having a lot of trouble finding new a pair of long distance trail running shoes that work for me. I've been thinking about buying vibram soles online and getting someone to re-sole a pair of road shoes I really like. For context, I'm running a trail marathon in March (Ohio) and an Ultra (34M) in April in Sedona AZ. I have run road marathons and trail half marathons before. I normally trail run in Solomon Sense Ride 4's and they're totally fine for me for the half marathon and under but anything over that and I'm finding they just aren't what I want to be in. I've tried on: Hoka Stinson, variety of Brooks, Nike Wildhorses. I'd like to try Topo's but there isn't a running store in my area that carries them. My favourite shoes are New Balances. My marathon go to shoes are New Balance Vongo's (my marathon pb is 4:18 so I'm not a speed demon).I'm basically thinking: NB Vongo + Vibram Zegama 1443 soles. Thoughts?Cost wise, it's not the smartest: old version of vongos - $90-$100, soles - $40-50, cobbler around me - $50-80. Just wondering what people think from a technical stand point, or if anyone has re-soled a shoe?

EDIT: I have nothing against any particular other trail shoe - I just have noticed my local stores (REI, Dick's, Fleet Feet etc) don't stock many shoes and I'd prefer to try on instead of buy blind from online. I was mostly curious about converting a shoe I know and like for a more trail specific use.

EDIT 2: Good point about the midsole! That hadn't occurred to me. Thanks!

I got those in 2E wide after a test in their shop which showed 'hollow feet'.

Unfortunately, it was a fail.  It was not for a real high instep - I had no shoelace left to actually tie the shoe with.  On top of that it squeaks in both shoes and the side of the sole starts to rub - something I've read isn't that uncommon after.  You shouldn't blister after a short walk...

So are there any shoes for a very high instep and high arch?  Bonus point if the brand is available in an Australian shop.

1azzqnp,XXRunning,"Shoes, blister and upcoming half ","I‚Äôm a little stuck in my head right now with options, hoping some of you may have some more experience than me! 

Trained for my first half marathon in Brooks Glycerin. Best case scenario, I do a sub 2:15, aiming for 2:20. The half is next week. 

I got a blister a couple weekends ago on my longest run (11miles). I‚Äôve done a single other 10miler, and then mostly all training was under 7miles. First blister, no issues previously, but I lost the nail and it‚Äôs been rather unpleasant/painful. I don‚Äôt know how much of it was the shoes itself, but it does worry me to wear it again. I was wearing hiking socks that day which could‚Äôve contributed, as well as finding myself on a fairly muddy route getting my feet wet. 

Since then, I‚Äôve tried to size up in hoka rincon and brooks Hyperion, but it was too big, plus my podiatrist suggested it‚Äôs not worth sizing up because I run the risk of other toe issues. I also figured that if I am going for new shoes, it would be good if they were lighter / more race friendly.

So now I am a week before the half and I have no idea what to do. 
- I can wear the brooks glycerin and buy some thinner running specific socks, and really hope it doesn‚Äôt cause a blister. I‚Äôll keep a small bandage over the missing nail. I can still return the brooks on their 90 day policy, but if I keep them for the half I can‚Äôt. 
- I can try to order something next day delivery. Ideally, this would be a lighter shoe - perhaps the Saucony endorphin speed - for the race and then also get to wear them for speed work. 
- However, considering I‚Äôll only have a day or two to take them out for a short run, carbon would be better, such as Saucony endorphin pro. It just seems massively overkill for my current speed to go for carbon shoes, whilst money isn‚Äôt particularly tight, it‚Äôs very much a consideration. Since signing up for this one 6 weeks ago, I do have desire to sign up to another half next year and train to get a better time, so it won‚Äôt be entirely a waste, although I‚Äôd rather buy it then when money will be still less of a consideration. 

So, I‚Äôve no idea what to do and I‚Äôm keen to hear advice. Thank you ",2024-02-25 21:37:57+00:00,3,6

X-rays indicated a sesamoid fracture - I wore a walking cast for 10 weeks and then slowly transitioned into Hoka sneakers with custom orthotics. Had a series of 3 cortisone injections that didn't seem to help very much. I've been going to PT twice a week for the past 3 months and do exercises daily. The PT has been effective at regaining range of motion in the big toe joint, but I still get swelling and pain in the toe joint if I walk more than \~20 minutes. I was an avid runner but running still seems very far in my future. I tried skiing last week, but after a few runs it started to hurt and now the foot has been especially irritated since then.

I did get an MRI several weeks ago, which showed no signs of fracture but an acute bout of sesamoiditis. Worse, my right foot has developed sesamoiditis from over-compensating which bothers me at times more than the left foot. 

I really don't know what to do... this injury has been incredibly frustrating and has changed my lifestyle drastically. I would love to get to a place where I can go on long walks/hikes pain free, play golf, and eventually even get back to running, but that seems so far out given the slow pace of recovery thus far. I spend many days without leaving home because my feet are too irritated.

I absolutely loved the clifton 7s and they have me just enough stability and cushion, but i have the clifton 9s right now and they give me more pain than i anticipated. They're clunkier than i would like and larger feel than I would like. 

\-high arches

\-bilateral bunions

\-bilateral slight supination when running 

Any Hokas shoes suggestions would be great!

1aupufr,Shoes,NB 990 user experiencing foot pain with other brands (long),"I've worn various New Balance 990s for about 20 years and have never had an issue with foot pain (aside from some minor shin splints if I walk more than about 12 miles in a day at a brisk pace).

I recently moved to a new place on the city trail system (paved and unpaved) and have tried a few different types of shoes since I wanted to have something that could get wet and dirty.  So far, I've tried 3 different brands and it feels like the arch support is too far back by about 3/4 of an inch in all of them.  It feels like it is jabbing into the inside arch of my foot, and like all of my weight is resting on the middle part of the shoe, eventually causing some minor but noticeable foot pain that doesn't recede after I take the shoes off.

The first pair I tried were Topo Terraventure 3s, a low drop trail running shoe and very different from the New Balances, almost like I had to relearn how to walk.  They were super squishy but they felt like the arch support in the right shoe was different than the left shoe.  The foot pain was the worst with these.  I returned them and tried some Hoka Speedgoats.  These were very different from the NBs and Hokas, and I almost felt unstable in them when standing around, like I wanted to fall backward. I also got some weird slight ankle and knee pain (never had that before) after walking 5-10 miles in them, I assume due to being unfamiliar with the huge amount of cushioning and unconsciously feeling like I needed to stabilize myself.  I still felt like most of my weight was coming down on the middle of the foot and they just are not comfortable to me.

Next I decided to try something more conventional and got a pair of Brooks Ghost 15 to see if low- vs. high drop was the issue.  I liked the plain style of the all-black ones, and since they were much less squishy than the other two shoes, they rectified the ankle/knee pain and stability issues... but I still feel like the arches are way too far back and my feet hurt, even just wearing them to work where I walk maybe a mile a day.

So, anyway, yesterday I went for a walk in 5-year old, beat NB 990v5s and my sore-ish feet started feeling better the longer I walked.

So, what is going on here?  Are my feet just used to the New Balances after wearing them for so long?  Or do I maybe have some foot issues starting to occur, that the New Balances mitigate and that the other shoes don't address?

Any thoughts would be appreciated, because now I'm getting gunshy about trying anything else.  Out of frustration I just ordered another pair of 990v5s.

I am in my mid 40s, weigh 150 lbs and normally wear a 10D. My other shoes with no foot pain issues are some Keen Braddocks (like a heavy hiking shoe) and some Danner Bull Run Lux boots.",2024-02-19 15:24:08+00:00,1,0
1aumpjf,hiking,Dealing with a bit of discomfort with trail runners. ,"The title is a little misleading since I was having he same issues with hiking boots as well. 

Yesterday I made the 2 hour trip to my closest REI to look at either trail runners or hiking boots and I found some Hoka's that felt like I was walking on clouds. I tried a few other brands like Altra and Salomon and I kept having the same issue. These shoes are designed to give support to your heel and my left foot fit all the shoes perfectly! But my right foot feels like the inside of my heels sits on the support a bit instead of being held by it.i attribute this to just walking with my foot crooked. I bought the Hoka's since the return policy is very good at REI and I'm hoping to do some walking on my treadmill and see if it gets better. 

I don't seem to have this issue with every day shoes since none of them really have support for the heel. Has anyone ever dealt with this. Should I try to learn to walk with my foot a little straighter? Is that even a think after years of walking a certain way? Will I just have to settle for running shoes since I did have the same issue with the boots? ",2024-02-19 12:59:53+00:00,2,10
1au36bw,cna,What shoes do you recommend for wide feet?,"For context, I used to wear new balance. They fit well, but within a few hours on a 12 hour clinical rotation I was looking for a chair. When I first got my current job at the VA, I googled ""best shoes for nurses"" and the first one that had mens sizes were hokas. It took me a few stops, but I finally found some in my size at a running shoe store. I fell in love, and got em. 

Here's the problem - they only last 300-500 miles, and usually worn out well before then. Going by the 2k steps = to a mile...I average out 10 miles a workday that I'm not being a 1:1 sitter. That's 120 miles a month. That's $160+ shoes every 3-4 months. Don't get me wrong, their great, but that's also a pretty penny.

Do you guys have any similar suggestions for wide feet that don't require a car payment every couple of months?

Edit: Sorry, my original post was actually at work from mobile, and I couldn't add too many details. I should add a few here.

I've actually purchased 3 Hoka's in the past year or so. The only ones on the website that come in my size are the Bondi 8's, and they only come in 3 colors. For Hoka, I wear a 12.5 W. New balances are like a 12.5 4E. A lot of my issues stem from growing up in Hawaii and running around barefoot or in rubber sli...flip flops or thongs, as ya'll call 'em. I've never been formally diagnosed with anything, but what I do know is that I get stabbing pain in my feet, specifically in my heels and back end of the arches, if I'm on them too long, too many days in a row...and I usually work Fri/Sat/Sun for my 3 12's, and an 8 every other Wednesday. My Mondays are usually spent in bed with my feet elevated. 

I've got a lot of great recomendations, and I'll be using it as my research going forward. I've got quite a few days off, so I'll go with some notes and actually head to some shoe stores and try them on.",2024-02-18 19:58:50+00:00,18,42

I tried on a few boots at REI but then saw a lot of people recommending trailrunners, which I don‚Äôt have much experience with but am open to. So far I‚Äôve looked at these:

- Lowa Renegade GTX (I tried these on and love the level of support, but I feel like hiking boots of this weight may be overkill since my route from Astorga to Santiago de Compostela is mainly paved)
- Altra Olympus 4 or 5
- Hoka Challenger 7s

Increased pain over last several years. Feels like I have no padding.

Pain is worst in the morning. Feet feel stiff and achy

Went to rheumatologist - zero inflammatory markers. I do have some general arthritics

Switched cancer meds in case the joint pain was related. Didn‚Äôt make a difference.

I was diagnosed with osteopenia but Oncologist says it actually improved, so not worried about calcium, etc.

Got physical therapy Q3 last year. They think my muscles were weak, so worked on building strength, etc.

Since December, been doing 30 minutes moderate strength building daily followed by 30 minute brisk walk in a gravel path

Also cycle 10 miles on Saturday.

I only wear Hokas now.

Been feeling stronger, better. But noticed that same bone on the left foot is starting to ache.
Stood for an hour during a concert and it escalated to a throbbing pain.

I put myself back in the boot, scheduled appointment with podiatrist for Monday and have stopped activity.

I am pretty frustrated. Feels like every time I get moving again, I get hurt. 

Seems like most discomfort is from standing, like concerts, cooking, etc. walking is less of a problem. 

Feels like I have no padding and that blood is pooling in metatarsal area. 

Is this just aging? Anything I can do to improve?

1as7h7r,trailrunning,Advice for trail Running Shoes that are Both Wide and Sealed,"I am looking for advice from trail runners.  

I have wide feet, and I am also looking for waterproof trail running shoes (or at least water resistant). 

I run with Hoka Cliftons on the road, which in the wide version fit great.  I have been trail running with them, and I like the stable base that they have as it makes me feel much less likely to roll an ankle.  

It is very cold and snowy where I am, and I would like to get basically as close to a waterproof clifton as possible.  

I tried merrell Nova 3 which fit great in a wide, but the sole was almost literally an inch smaller than the Clifton around the entire thing.  Felt like running on stilts and I almost rolled my ankle on the first rocky/rooty area I got to. 

It seems like I can get wides in some and goretex in others but am having a hard time finding both in a shoe that feels stable.

I have been interested in possibly buying some waterproof and water resistant shoes for standing in all day, mainly for use in healthcare. I currently wear clifton 9s and used to wear a waterproof shoe which didn't work out unfortunately. There are several I have in mind that have all gotten good reviews, but I wanted to hear personal experiences on how they were comfort wise. 

Some brands I have in mind are vessi, gales, clove supercush, hoka clifton gtx, bondi sr or if there are any shoes I may have missed? Most of these shoes can only be bought online so for those who have worn them, how are they?

I used to wear classic cloves, but they didn't work out for me. It did not fit properly. It did not feel cushioned enough and had some breathability issues. ",2024-02-16 02:37:06+00:00,0,1
1arc760,PlantarFasciitis,Stable/stiff flip-flop (thong) recommendations," TL;DR I need a stable, torsionally/longitudinally stiff flip-flop (thong in Australia) recommendation.  
So I actually don't have plantar fasciitis - I have osteoarthritis in my big toe joints (1st MTP joint capsule), and r/osteoarthritis is a lot less active than here. Since PF folk are very serious, specific and knowledgeable about footwear, I figure many of you will have experimented and be able to offer advice, because I think that the ideal style of footwear may be slightly similar. I need footwear which has a sturdy/more rigid sole that is torsionally/longitudinally stiff. That is, if you grab the shoe at the heel in one hand, and the toe-end in the other hand, and try to bend it into a U shape along the sole, or twist it, then ideally the shoe offers a lot of resistance to this movement. Basically, more stability.  
I was advised such footwear is ideal for my OA in the big toes, as opposed to my old Nike Frees or Skechers I was wearing (which were both super flexible in the sole - you can fold them in half). So for the past half-decade I've been wearing Hoka trainers almost exclusively (Challenger and Arahi), and 5.11 tactical casual footwear - both are really torsionally stiff compared to other footwear, but still comfortable. There is a night-and-day improvement in pain in the affected joints since switching to this footwear.  
Now ... I do know that flip-flops are absolutely the worst thing for this type of OA. But it's Australia, and I live near the ocean, and I need flip-flops to wear to the beach.  
I prefer flip-flops to slides or sandals from an ease of on/off perspective, as well as just feeling like slides are gonna fall off my massive feet (US13). Hoka make their Ora model in a flip/thong but have discontinued it in favour of the slide. I've read reports that the toe strap would often break.  
I have seen that Crocs Mellow Flips are popular with PF folk - are they longitudinally stiff as well as comfy?  
Or Oofos flips? Reef? Vionic?  
Any other recommendations?

Thanks in advance.

EDIT: I have searched through and found many flip-flop/sandal recommendation posts - but I don't know if the responses are specifically for something soft in the heel and arch for PF, or for stability (which I am focusing on).",2024-02-15 10:06:17+00:00,2,10

I‚Äôll try to keep this short but I have a few questions about the CP in late March (semana Santa) of this year. Sorry if they‚Äôve been answered already here but there‚Äôs just so much info to go through!

Background: hoping to do CP from Porto to Santiago de Campostela finishing on Easter Monday. Physically fit, young, runner, and walk 9-13 miles a day on average. Have walked 15+ miles a few times before.

1. I want to do the litoral/costal route from Porto for the first 1-2 days, as I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs the better choice. Would this change add too much distance to finish in 11 days? Hoping to not take a bus if not necessary.

2. I‚Äôll have 11 days to complete it & will not be traveling from far. I know that 10 days is average/doable on the CP, but I‚Äôll have an extra day to spread out one long stage‚Äî which portion would be best to take an extra day? Maybe a long section or a town that‚Äôs better suited for more time to explore/rest?

3. I would be arriving in Santiago on Easter Monday to avoid the Sunday crowds. Since I‚Äôll be walking during semana santa, is it necessary to make reservations for albergues more than a day in advance? Especially in the beginning, I‚Äôd prefer to have more flexibility and not book everything.

4. Are hiking boots necessary? I have both well broken in boots and hokas. I‚Äôm comfortable with walking long distances in the hokas, but worried about muddy trails given the time of year. 

If you read all this thank you (and I‚Äôm sorry lol)! I‚Äôd love any other advice too",2024-02-12 13:16:17+00:00,4,5

1amzaxm,PlantarFasciitis,toe yoga for plantar fasciitis,"I just wanted to let everyone who suffers with plantar fasciitis know about something I came across that seems to be the culprit of this disease: Big toe atrophy due to shoes thats cutting off blood supply to plantae fascia!! I started doing toe yoga yesterday (alternatively tapping floor w big toe and small toes 30 times; also spreading the toes and holding it for 5 seconds; repeat 10 times) and stretching the foot and toes forward (not stretching pf but the opposite direction) and my pf this morning is almost gone!! I do the stretch mutliple times a day 10 times. My plan is to implement barefoot walking 5-10 mins a day (you have to build up!!) on carpet or grass and using toe seperators daily for 1 h and reverse stretch on top of heel raises and deep calf massage. The doctor who found out the culprit may be the big toe explains it in this video, they are called ‚ÄúNorthwest Foot & Ankle‚Äù

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tNPfbB2sX5Q&pp=ygUecGxhbnRhciBmYXNjaWl0aXMgdG9lIHNwcmVhZGVy

important: only 5 minutes barefoot in beginning and only when you feel you are ready preferable on grass or carpet, no heel striking. this is just personal experience, dont go too fast, maybe barefoot is too much for you!! My PF is not very bad, its like a 3 out of 10, you may have to progress much slower and wait to do any types of barefoot!!

mistakes i have made: doing too many calf raises and progressing too fast. Had a major flare up after i did one legged heel drops over a step when my feet were not ready. Also: too much walking too soon!! You have to progress slowly. My physical therapist told me only 10 two legged calf raises two sets in my case! i did way too many too soon.. if you dont have a PT remember to go SLOWLY on your own, see how you feel after 24h. Your masucles are stronger than your ligaments!! Only cause your muscles dont feel it doesnt mean your ligaments can handle it.

Idk im feeling a lot of hope after 6 months of suffering and wanted to share this video and i hope toe yoga and focusing on toe health and stretching toes forward helps someone feel better too. This disorder is so frustrating like your life is cut in half, everything i enjoy involves walking i don‚Äôt like being tied to the bed all day!! So i did a lot of research and what this doctor says gave me new hope. I love my PT she is also into minimalist shoes but she said in the beginning not to do minimalist shoes, support is needed in the beginning. She personally alrernates between minimalist and cushioned shoes based on what she is doing and she is healthy. I dont think i ever wanna do minimalist shoes really but i plan on just walking barefoot around the house at all times eventually. Not yet tho it would be too soon, the main thing is to not do too much too soon. 

Just some ideas, maybe it helps someone but progress SLOWLY.

edit: barely feeling my pf anymore but found out i have insertional achilles tendonitis also. now doing this (toe exercises, wearing toe spacers daily for like 30-60 mins) and no calf stretches and isometric calf raises to floor level only. nothing that would put foot in dorsiflexion. Not much barefoot walking atm, saucony shoes with wide toebox are great atm. Plantar fasciitis still feels good almost not notifeable but achilles tendonitis sucks i also recover from paroneal tendon tear that occasionally flares up

edit: I had another flare up with plantar fasciitis after wearing some bad indoor sandals (they had a heel) for a few days. The plantar fasciitis flare up lasted around 2 months I am now again 95 % cured. I did the toe spacers 2 hrs a day and started using feet warmers too. I did also muscle scraping a few times (scraping the sole of my feet and the calves) with a spoon that left bruises and I waited until tue bruises were gone until I scraped again. I went back to wearing sneakers (hoka clifton 9) also indoors due to my achilles tendonitis too. Currently wear hokas indoors and outdoors and doing calf raises every 3 days for my achilles as well as my plantar fascia, also single leg dead lifts (those I do barefoot to strengthen the arch) and toe exercises where you scrunch a towel.. Occasionally I walk barefoot indoors like 5 minutes, trying to easy myself into it slowly. ",2024-02-09 21:33:59+00:00,26,20

1akcyrn,walking,Pain from Hallux Rigidus: shoe recommendations?,"
What shoe should I try to reduce the pain I experience from hallux rigidus? Some people suggest getting a very rigid shoe to reduce big toe movement, while others claim you should get a natural and very flexible shoe that allows you to strengthen your toe and increase mobility. This has left me confused on what approach to take. Any advice would be appreciated!


Long version:
I have been diagnosed with hallux rigidus and I am currently experiencing great pain in my left big toe as well as pain shooting down the left outer side of my left foot when walking. I also have growing pain in my left knee when walking and going up stairs. I am a male, 38 years old, 6‚Äô4‚Äù, 325 lbs, and I like to hike. I am a teacher and I am on my feet most of the day. I am currently wearing Hoka Bondi 8‚Äôs with a custom footpad fashioned by my podiatrist. Even while wearing these, the pain in my toe is still quite severe when I walk. My goal is to get down to my ideal weight of 200 lbs, but this is very hard to accomplish when I have severe foot pain with every step I take.

I have done a lot of research trying to figure out what kind of shoes I should buy to help reduce the hallux rigidus pain while walking, but I have been finding a lot of contradictory information. On one end of the spectrum, people say to get a very rigid shoe like a sturdy hiking boot that greatly decreases the flexing of the big toe and essentially acts as a cast. They also recommended getting a carbon fiber insole to further reduce toe movement when walking. 

Other people claim that you should be wearing natural footwear that mimics walking barefoot as much as possible. Lots of flexibility and minimal cushioning. They also recommend doing therapeutic foot strengthening exercises to foster better foot health. 

This has left me confused. My primary goal is that I want to be able to walk around with as little foot pain as possible so I can do my job, enjoy hiking, and get down to a healthy weight. Which way do I go: rigid footwear that acts as a boot/cast or natural footwear that is highly flexible?",2024-02-06 15:53:00+00:00,3,4

1aedwwy,Shoes,Shoes for standing and walking all day and general use," 

Hello everyone!

I  recently bought a pair of Brooks Ghost Max to wear at work (I stand and  walk most of my shift, with some sitting, depending on how busy it is)  after research and reading reviews. I would wear these shoes daily as  well. My feet hurt. My heels hurt and the balls of my feet hurt and  sometimes my midfoot. I've had them for about 2 weeks now.

I  wonder if anyone else has had that happen to them with the Ghost Max?  They also simply don't feel cushioned/cushiony to me at all. I am so  disappointed. I wore my old Nike React Infinity Run 3 for two days  recently (I have two pairs that I will switch every other day) and they  felt like old friends and my feet started feeling better.

I  am eying perhaps the Asics Gel Kayano 30 or a pair of OnClouds or New  Balance or maybe even Hokas. I am open to your thoughts and opinions.

I  tried the newest Nike Infinity Run4's but that tight gusset thing was a  dealbreaker and I had to return them. The bottom of the shoes was  absolutely perfect. Wish they hadn't added that.",2024-01-30 02:49:23+00:00,2,5

This time around, I have been developing calf soreness (likely due to lactic acid buildup) after 7-9 miles.

For the first two attempts, I developed soreness after 7 miles. I attributed that to my new hiking boots (Hoka Kaha) instead of my regular Hoka Speedgoat 5s.

On my third attempt today, I went back to my Hoka Speedgoat 5. I developed similar soreness at 9.5 miles.

I‚Äôm a bit lost. I never had this kind of issue before ‚Äî certainly not at 7-10 miles (maybe at 15 miles).

My potential guesses: (i) I switched from Cliff bars (every 45-60 minutes) to Atkins bars. (ii) I Didn‚Äôt wear my ‚Äútights‚Äù (Elite leggings) ‚Äî I doubt this. \[BTW, I'm very well hydrated -- 1 liter of water before, 1/2 liter every 2 miles. Take Gu Gels every 45 mins, started off with 1 scoop of Zales electrolytes\]

(iii) Maybe I just need to wait a few more hikes to get to 15-20 miles (My 22-mile R2R was 2.5 months back).

My plan: (I) Take Advils (it helped with 15-20 miles), (ii) Go back to Cliff bars, (iii) Do Calf raises to build up calf muscles (iv) Lots of stretches before I start.

Any other advice would help. Thanks.",2024-01-26 01:54:57+00:00,0,22

19dwthw,PlantarFasciitis,Altra Torin making it worse?,"Just started wearing Atra Torin 7 a few weeks ago. I really like the open toe box but now fear they are making my PF worse.

For backstory I had to stop wearing my hoka bondis for a different reason: the inward-facing side of my big toe/metatarsal area, or the spot where the base of my toe meets my foot, rubs up against the space where the edge of the insole meets the interior wall of the shoe every time I step. At the end of the day, that spot had started to feel almost numb from the repeated friction. Had never dealt with this until a few weeks ago but it became unbearable to keep walking in the hokas while wearing an insole or orthotic.

The open toe box on the altras completely eliminates this problem‚Ä¶ but they also seem to inflame the PF in my heels (can‚Äôt really tell but it‚Äôs been bothering me more in recent days). Been doing rathleff protocol every day to try and minimize by strengthening my foot, but I worry that walking in the altras is just making the condition worse.

The only footwear that doesn‚Äôt seem to cause either of these problems is crocs.

Please help: has anyone struggled with this, particularly the big toe friction issue? Do I just need to ‚Äútransition more slowly‚Äù to zero drop shoes, and what does that actually mean??

Finally, are there any crocs models that are both effective for PF and acceptable to wear in the office, particularly in winter?

19d5ql3,sesamoid,Painful Hokas,"Hi all, I have been dealing with a sesamoid fracture for a little over a year now. I tried Hoka Bondi 8s in the wide fit and whilst it certainly helped the pain in the ball of my foot, it caused a lot of pain and issues with my 5th metatarsal and styloid process due to the shape of the shoe. My feet aren‚Äôt wide, yet for some reason the shoes just don‚Äôt work for me. That sharp plastic ridge running along the outside of the shoe certainly doesn‚Äôt help.

I‚Äôve spent about 8 months trying to get my custom orthotics working, but they still aren‚Äôt right and are back in the shop to get altered.

I‚Äôve been wearing crocs indoors, which aren‚Äôt too bad. Although recently I‚Äôve started getting pain and swelling in the joint of the 2nd toe due to gait changes. The Hokas address that, but unfortunately cause too much pain on the outside of my feet to use them.

I was hoping to get some other shoe suggestions, or anything I could do to ‚Äòfix‚Äô the Bondi 8s. I am looking for another trainer/sneaker for daily use, but I also really need some suggestions for office shoes, as I can‚Äôt wear athletic shoes in the office.

Note that I‚Äôve tried Altra Lone Peaks, but they make the pain worse at the moment. Currently I‚Äôm using a pair of ASICS with cheap ¬£7 insoles for some arch support. These are acceptable for the moment, but don‚Äôt address the issue with what to wear in the office or properly offload the ball of my foot like the Bondi 8s.

19ch11k,Marathon_Training,Enough time for new shoes?,"I'm running my second Marathon in Austin o  Feb 18, and am leaning heavily towards doing it in Nike Pegasus 40s that have just under 100 miles in them (I've had 5 pairs of Pegs that have all done me well). I'll probably put another 20-30 miles on them before the race, so they'll be in a sweet spot. My only other race shoe option in my rotation is a pair of Hoka Mach 5 with 350 miles on them - I think I'll still get 100 more miles on them, but they are feeling a bit tired to race a marathon in.

I have 28 days till the race - is it too late to get a new pair of shoes broken in as an option to race in? I've never had Saucony but Endorphin Speed seems to be a favorite around here and I'm thinking about jumping into a pair to see how my body fares in them.

Knowing that my feet/knees like Pegs and Hoka Mach 5, any recommendations on shoe? I have no issues with gait or have need for massively cushioned or stabilizing shoes. Also, I'm not looking for a super shoe - I'm not fast enough (aiming for +/- 3:40 marathon) for them to make enough of a difference to justify $220+ on a shoe.

197pnq9,walking,Looking for advice on a 100mile walk,"I‚Äôm looking to walk 100miles in one go towards the end of this year. Looking for any and all advice! Resources, workout plans, people who have done this before.

Here‚Äôs as far as I‚Äôve gotten in planning and some other info-
The walk will be attempted in a single go. I am aiming to take a few breaks but nothing overnight. I know that if I walked the average pace of 3mph I‚Äôd be done in 33.33hrs. But I know that‚Äôs unrealistic lol. I‚Äôm starting to plan my route and will be taking elevation into account and will be aiming to avoid any large incline. I‚Äôm planning on doing this assisted and have my partner meet at certain locations for food and water. I am moderately fit and currently using Hoka Bondi 8s. I walk an average of 1.5miles a day.

197oq32,AskDocs,Chronic pain from old sesamoid fracture,"I am 26F and was diagnosed with sesamoiditis in both feet/a fractured medial sesamoid bone in my left foot in 2020. I believe the fracture occurred in 2016 when I was a ballet dancer doing a principal role in a show, because I didn't want to lose the part I kept dancing through it (on pointe). I eventually quit dance in part due to the chronic pain. I have increased my activity levels in the past few months, including taking ballet classes again, the pain is becoming more intense and more frequent. I recently saw a podiatrist who told me to wear dancers pads both in and out of ballet shoes, to never walk barefoot and to only wear oofos or hokas. Hopefully this will help with symptom management and I can continue to be physically active. But I am really interested in more than symptom management - if there are any ways to treat my condition at the source and repair the bone itself.


TLDR: I am interested in learning about ways to heal old fractures that were never treated with a splint or cast or boot. I am definitely willing to wear a boot now if it means I can have less pain in the future. The information I am seeing online usually pertains to new fractures that won't heal, not ones that are years old. I have heard about Exogen but I am not sure if that is only for new fractures. Thanks for your advice.

I was looking at other Hoka and Nike Gore-Tex shoes, but all of them are too narrow in the middle part of the sole. Basically my foot is still wide where most shoes start narrowing down. Hopefully the picture below can help illustrate the issue

The next morning, I had the worst low back pain ever. It felt like my sacrum was locked in a weird tilt. It took 2 days to relax. 

Repeat x2. Every time I try wearing the brooks, my sacrum hurts SO bad the next day. So these brand new shoes are sitting, unworn.

[Return to Activity After Sesamoidectomy in Athletically Active Individuals](https://sci-hub.se/10.1177/107110070302400507)

[Austin Foot and Ankle institute Tibial Sesamoidectomy hand out](https://sa1s3.patientpop.com/assets/docs/401215.pdf) \- this is the only resource I've found so far that has an actual list of exercises, this is great in combo with exercises my physio has given me. 

My physio, and that handout, both recommend exercises with a ""theraband"", a very thin stretchy rubber band used for resistance exercises. It's totally different to most exercise bands, and luckily super cheap!   
My tibial/medial sesamoidectomy went really well - I'm planning to do a more detailed write up at the 6 month mark, but in summary, my experience suprisingly wasn't that painful (I took opioids only a single time), and at 3 months, my scar has totally and cleanly healed, and I'm now able to walk pretty normally all day in flat ""suburban"" settings, e.g around the house, at a mall! This is an enormous improvement already to pre-surgery when 10 minutes was painful, and I had to use crutches. I spent new years at a party without crutches, and wearing barefoot shoes! (they matched my outfit better than the hokas I usually wear) I feel like life is opening up with possibilities again.  
I really need to focus on dedicated rehab every day at this point though, I could be doing so much more to intentionally even up my calves, and generally exercise again. I've really gotten out of the habit, even though through the duration of this whole sesamoid issue, I could have been biking and doing many forms of strength training. I hope I remember from this experience that there is ALWAYS a way to exercise, you just have to learn to be creative in responding to whatever situation pops up in life. I was in so much despair that I just totally gave up. I have a lot of empathy for myself and other people in that state of mind, it's really tough. Watching [SBSK](https://www.youtube.com/@SpecialBooksbySpecialKids), interviews with people with disabilities helped me a lot. Also, I recently read The Diary of Anne Frank, which had many wise insights about how to find beauty in life in any situation.  


Happy new year to everyone in the group, all the best for recovery.

18wh9rx,CaminoDeSantiago,"My packing list, plus commentary","When I was planning my Camino, I loved looking at people's packing lists and commentary on what they wish they'd left behind, are glad they brought, etc. I also really appreciated seeing what kind of clothing other people brought. So I figured I'd do the same. 

Things to know about me: I'm a 44-year-old American woman. I'm on the smallish side. I loathe being cold; it makes me sleepy. I have a few minor health etc. issues (allergies, eczema, heartburn, ADHD). I dye my hair purple. I wear dresses/skirts and leggings every day even at home, because that's just what I find the most comfortable. 

I did the Frances this last April and May, leaving St. Jean Pied de Port on April 20th and arriving in Santiago on May 27th. 

**My backpack:** From REI, the women's ""Trail 40 Pack."" As the name implies it says it's 40L, but I'm not actually sure that's accurate? It was perfectly fine. I didn't have any issues with it. I didn't use a water bladder with it, but you can.  

**Trekking poles:** I got these in St. Jean Pied de Port, they were Leki brand. I loved them so much I had them shipped home when I was done. 

**Rain poncho:** A rather light-weight brightly-colored one from amazon (brand says Anyoo) that could double as a tarp or shelter if necessary. I spent a little extra to get one that was truly waterproof and weighed a little less--it shed rain VERY well, even in downpours the day after Zubiri. I think I used it about three times? I didn't want to bring a separate rain jacket and pants. It also meant I didn't have to bring the backpack cover.   
**Sun hat:** Columbia sportswear. I wore that thing so much I'm surprised I didn't accidentally wear it to bed. Every time I went to mass I'd realize I was still wearing it, oops.  
**Gloves:** fairly thin wool ones. I think I wore them maybe twice?  
**Wool Buff:** I used it as a headband, ear warmer/hat, and eye mask for sleeping. Definitely one of the best things I brought!   
**Silk scarf:** A few months before I left, I saw a silk scarf on etsy that was my favorite shade of lavender and printed with a pattern of sea shells, including scallops. It was a long rectangle instead of a big square, which limits its usefulness. BUT it made me feel pretty, and it did keep my neck warm and protected from the sun, and when I wasn't wearing it I tied it to my backpack a bit like a flag, and it weighed almost nothing. I still wear it all the time.  
**Four pairs of synthetic undies with a leak-proof pantiliner:** by the brand Knix, since that's what I wear at home. I did do a ""wash in the sink/hang overnight"" test to make sure they dry fast enough.  
**Two pairs liner socks:** Coolmax by Injiji. Ehhhhh I probably could have skipped these. They didn't help with my blisters because mine were almost entirely pinch blisters. They \*were\* handy for walking around town in flip-flops, both for warmth and to keep people from seeing how beat-up my feet were!  
**Two pairs wool-blend hiking socks:** I bought Darn Tough. They were awesome. I still wear them almost daily--they're comfy and they can really take some abuse.  
**One pair leggings:** Synthetic, with big side pockets. Got these from REI on clearance. I was able to get them in my fave color, lavender.  
**One pair black shorts:** also from REI, same line. They also had the big side pockets. I wore them on hot days, I wore them as pj bottoms, I wore them the once I went swimming.   
**One pair warm fleece-lined pants:** Not gonna lie, these took up a TON of space in my backpack. They were also nearly 11oz/300g. BUT. Boy was I glad to have them. They were great for chilly mornings/evenings. I could put them on over my leggings when starting out on a cold day, or wear them by themselves in the evening while my other clothes were drying.  
**Two bras**: Both from the brand Kindred Bravely, the style Nellie, which is in synthetic fabric and doesn't have an underwire but does have the hooks in the back and enough support for walking. One bra was black so it could double as a swim top.   
**One long-sleeved dress:** From the brand wool&, the Rowena. It's a wool blend and has pockets.  
**One short-sleeved dress:** This one was by Smartwool and again was a wool blend, but it pilled like crazy. Next time I'd just wear another wool& dress in a short-sleeved style and a different color.   
**One short-sleeved shirt:** Uniqlo, from their airism line. I think I only wore it to sleep in.   
**One pullover-style long-sleeved hoodie:** A synthetic hoodie that was REALLY soft but thick. In retrospect I should've gone for a lighter/thinner one.   
**Puffer jacket:** This was my Christmas present to myself the Christmas before my Camino, as it was not cheap. I got it from Icebreaker, and the stuffing is 80% wool. It weighs almost nothing and compresses into its own pocket. It's incredibly warm for how little it weighs. I still wear this all the time!  
**Crocs:** I bought the same size I'd been wearing around the house at home. Turns out my feet swell more than expected, which made these press painfully on my blisters, and within four days I'd tossed them into a donation box and bought flip-flops. Next time I might bring Chacos or something similar that I can hike in sometimes.  
**Boots:** I can hear half of you now--wear trail runners!! I used to do a job that involved walking outside all day in the city and suburbs. I sprained my ankles multiple times in trail runners. I do not sprain my ankles in hiking boots (or Chacos, oddly enough). They were Hokas, and meant to feel like trail runners. The blisters were not the boots' fault. Also, I had Birkenstock orthotics in these. The combo of squishy shoes with ankle support and Birkenstock orthotics is the only thing my feet seem to like. Though again, I might try Chacos next time.   
**Massage ball:** a bumpy plastic ball. Didn't weigh much. Great for massaging my feet at the end of the day. I also lent it out to numerous people at albergues.   
**Brierley guidebook:** I did use the Wise Pilgrim app a LOT, but I really liked having the physical guidebook as well. I sometimes wrote notes on things I wanted to do/places I wanted to stay in the guidebook   
**Paper journal and pen:** I didn't journal as much as I intended to. But it was nice to have a spot to write things down by hand. I also had a print-out of the order for Mass in English and Spanish side-by-side that I'd taped into the journal--I'm Episcopalian and not Catholic, and I don't speak much Spanish. (I also looked up the daily readings for mass in English on my phone.) 

**A bunch of slider-style ziploc bags in numerous sizes:** for organizing my belongings, including some extras. They were (imho) less noisy than stuff sacks or packing cubes, but they weren't silent. They also had the advantage of being see-through. I also had a net lingerie bag for dirty clothing.

**USB-C wall charger with European plug**   
**Short USB-C-to-lightning charging cable for phone**  
**Portable battery (and cable):** USB-C is faster than normal USB. The portable battery aka power bank was by Zendure and could charge my phone several times. What I'd usually do is charge the battery when I got to my albergue, and then use that to charge my phone when I went to bed. It meant I didn't have to leave my phone anywhere out of sight, and I was never worried about my phone dying.  

**Compressible daypack:** This compressed to a tiny tiny thing that hooked on my backpack. I used this thing DAILY: I would put everything in it to take my shower and do laundry, then resort my belongings to go explore the town and/or find dinner and/or go to mass. I also used it the couple of times I had my backpack transported. 

**A carabiner/hook:** Cannot remember/find the brand name on this, but it's this thing that converts from a carabiner to a rubber-lined S-hook (so it'll stay over the back of shower doors etc). I ended up keeping my sleeping bag on the outside of my backpack, but the stuff sack didn't have any straps, and the carabiner meant I could use the backpack's straps at the bottom and tighten them down enough to keep the sleeping bag there; and then at the albergues I'd use it to hang my daypack on the back of shower doors.

Toiletries:

**Fancy zippered toiletry bag:** in retrospect it was too small. I ended up only leaving things I rarely used in it, and putting everything else in a ziploc  
**Sunscreen:** kept this in an outside pocket of my backpack  
**Toothbrush, toothpaste, floss:** The same things I use at home. I'm picky about my toothpaste.  
**Bar soap in a dry bag:** The fancy dry bag was supposed to make it so the soap dried out during the day, but no matter what I did that didn't work. But also I left it somewhere (Viana??) and went back to a ziploc bag anyway!   
**Aquaphor:** a thick vaseline-based ointment, great for a ton of things  
**Travel towel:** I brought a large-ish one, thinking it would double for other things (like a blanket?), and I never used it that way. I should've bought something smaller and lighter.  
**Washcloth**   
**Deodorant**   
**Comb, a few hair elastics**  
**Hard case for my glasses, and a small microfiber wipe for the lenses:** on a related note, my glasses had transition lenses so I didn't have to bring a separate pair of sunglasses and risk losing them.  
**Benadryl, immodium, Azo (painkiller for UTI's):** a few of each, just in case  
**Purple shampoo in a small travel bottle:** I estimated how much I'd use washing my hair twice a week and it was plenty  
**Purple hair conditioner bar:** Also in a fancy dry bag that didn't dry it out lol  
**A bunch of diaper pins with plastic heads:** I read multiple people who suggested bringing these, and they were RIGHT. I never had to worry about the supply of clothespins at albergues. People were less likely to take my things by accident because they were distinctive. They ended up being useful for multiple things, like attaching items to my backpack during the day to dry. I also ended up setting one aside to pop blisters after dipping the point in Betadine gel.  
**A few feet of paracord:** for laundry when the albergue ran out of clothesline space, could theoretically use it to turn my poncho into a shelter if needed or tie around my waist over my poncho on a windy day. I only ever used it for laundry, as it turns out.  
**Prescription-strength hydrocortisone cream:** in case my eczema flared up or I got bitten by mosquitos. I was lucky enough not to need it but I was still glad to have it.  
**Melatonin, Zyrtec, Heartburn meds:** All my medications were put in tiny plastic ziplocs along with the torn-out box label so I could tell which was which.  
**Tampons and a few pads:** I wish I'd brought more pads, honestly. The ones in Spain all seemed scented and didn't have enough glue! (I can't use menstrual cups. I used to, for like twenty years, but now they cause irritation.)  
**Mascara, powder, lipstick:** Despite wearing these every single day at home, I never ended up using them on my Camino!

**Sleeping bag:** a summer weight bag from LL Bean. Not too heavy or too expensive.  
**Silk liner:** I used this all of twice and I hated it. Totally could've skipped this. It just slid around inside the bag and twisted around me, ugh.  
**Earplugs:** I brought along my fave Loop earplugs, and accidentally left them at my albergue in Uterga. They're comfy and work great, but in all honesty my bluetooth earbuds and ocean sounds from an app blocked out snoring better.

**A photocopy of the first pages of my passport and a list of emergency contact numbers:** tucked into the bottom of my backpack. 

In my fanny pack/hip bag, which never left my sight waking or sleeping:

**Phone:** actually this was usually in my leggings pocket.   
**Bluetooth earbuds, the kind on a leash:** they recharged using the same cable as the portable battery, which was nice  
**Bank cards:** in a small zippered pouch  
**A few days' worth of cash:** in the same pouch as the Wise card  
**Credencial, passport and vaccine card:** in a ziploc  
**Lip balm with SPF**  
**Aleve aka naproxen sodium**   
**ADHD medication:** this was the only medication that wasn't labeled in the little ziploc bag. When I brought it on my flight I had the ziploc in the original prescription bottle. The night I arrived in France, I tucked the original bottle in the bottom of my backpack, and put the baggie in my fanny pack.   
**Rosary, and a small leaflet on how to pray it:** I ended up mostly wearing the rosary. It was intended to be worn as a bracelet wrapped around my wrist several times, but I mostly kept it around my neck. It didn't obviously look like a rosary.

**What I did for water:** bought bottled water along the way. I'd refill the bottles for a week or to and toss the bottles once they got nasty and buy new ones. This just weighed less than the alternatives. 

The weight of my backpack, at the airport on the way out, was about 15lb/6.8kg. I was aiming for somewhere between 10-15% of my bodyweight, and I succeeded, hell yeah.

Things I wish I'd brought: 

**Things to treat blisters**. I thought I wouldn't get any because I didn't on my training hikes. Turns out there's a difference between walking ten miles once a week, and walking thirteen miles day after day after day. (I mean I also walked to work, two miles each way. But still. I needed more days of longer distances that repeated.)  
**One of those things to clip hand disinfectant to my backpack or fanny pack.** WAY too many bathrooms did not have soap, even in the albergues.   
**Knitting!** At the end of my day's walk I sometimes spent far too much time fucking around on my phone, which makes one look anti-social. Whereas knitting invites people to talk to you.

18o4jyb,bunions,HOKA Bondi 8 Wide vs. Gaviota 5 Regular,"My left foot surgery was on November 16th, so I'm not even 6 weeks out yet. I went to go try on some shoes last weekend in order to get a Christmas present for myself (boot is supposed to officially come off December 27th ü§û, though I can take a few steps with a cane or crutches now). 

In the first store I visited, there weren't any Bondi in my size to try on. The Clifton style felt super cushiony, but I tried on a men's Clifton in a color I didn't like. I went home and bought the Clifton online in my size in a color that I liked and it was close, but not quite cushiony enough. I didn't like the way the pair I ordered felt when I walked in them. It wasn't as cushiony as the men's pair from the store. The width and size are good, though, just not soft enough. 

I desperately wanted the oft-lauded Bondi 8 to work for me. So, I went to another store to try on Women's Bondi 8's in 8.5W, 9.5W and 10W. My pre-surgery size is 9W, but my ""new"" foot is measuring between size 8 or 8.5 regular on the shoe sizers. The Bondi 8 toe box was too tight for my left foot. It felt fine on the right (which still needs surgery). I thought that was weird, since my left foot is much narrower than my right foot. Again, thanks to all the swelling (fun!).

I get that there will be swelling for a while, so I abandoned the Bondi 8's and started looking at other HOKA styles. 

The Gaviota 5 in 9.5D was just perfect for both feet! Not only was the fabric stretchy enough, but the toe box was wider in the regular size than the Bondi 8 toe box was in the Wide. I was shocked! I can't tell you the last time I purchased a women's shoe in regular size... Merry Christmas to me! 

Anyway, my whole point of this (and thanks for getting this far) is that I so appreciate the brick-and-mortar stores that still exist. And, I'm excited to have found shoes that I (hopefully) get to wear on both feet soon!",2023-12-22 02:44:30+00:00,37,38

18kpw8v,PlantarFasciitis,"How I cured my forefoot plantar fasciitis/sesamoiditis (pain under ball of big toe, and inner side of foot)","I'm documenting this here because when I was first researching this, I couldn't really find anyone in the same situation as me: a ""plantar fasciitis"" diagnosis but with NO heel pain, NO sole pain, and NO increased pain after prolonged rest. So I hope maybe this will help someone else.

**What was my baseline?**

* I'm a walker, not a runner. I enjoy walking for hours at a time, and walking is my primary mode of transportation.
* I am not muscular or strong at all, I have bad posture (upper cross syndrome) and I do not consider myself athletic.
* I tend to be inattentive to my body.

**What pain did I have?**

I had three different kinds of pain:

* Bruise-like pain under the ball of my big toe (especially when the condition first started). It hurt to even palpate that area.
* Pain in my big toe when I tried to scrunch it, for example to do a ""towel curl"" exercise. This gradually abated over a few months and was eventually gone completely.
* Aching, straining pain on the inner *side* of my arch - as I healed a bit, this became the most common and long-standing pain, and would start up if I walked too much or too quickly. This really confused the professionals. They all expected the pain to be on the underside of my foot (the sole), not the *side* of my foot. If you look at the diagram below, this pain was basically the #7 region.

&#x200B;

[My third type of pain was in the #7 region](https://preview.redd.it/5b9lklarow6c1.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6a2357cf43a873ead2bb9d816ec7d600d42ab9c)

**What worsened the pain?**

Once I was injured, these three things became a big no-no:

* Bearing down my full weight on the ball of my big toe (so calf raises were out of the question, and actually caused setbacks)
* Walking too long (over 1.5 hours) or too quickly (rushing for even 10 minutes would cause worsened pain)
* Lying in bed on my back, with my feet naturally tilted a tiny bit forward in relaxed plantar flexion - for some reason, dorsiflexion felt fine, and full ""pointed toe"" ballet-style plantar flexion felt fine too, but SLIGHT plantar flexion caused the aches/strains.

**How did the pain start?**

Leading up to my condition, I felt no pain or warning signs. However, I'd been doing a lot of heavy walking over the previous couple months - including with a bag over one shoulder, so I was probably walking a bit weirdly/asymmetrically. Maybe that overloaded my foot without me noticing.

What really did it was going out dancing one evening. Again, there was no pain - but the next day I could barely walk. The pain was in the ball of my big toe, I googled and it seemed to be my sesamoid region. I thought I had sesamoiditis.

**What professionals did I see?**

I knew something was really wrong right away. Within two weeks I saw a physiotherapist, podiatrist and doctor. All suspected plantar fasciitis instead of sesamoiditis, even though I seemed to lack its hallmark symptoms. I got an ultrasound which didn't really show anything, but was told that's common even when there's an issue.

**What were my broad stages of recovery?**

My whole recovery took about 9 months. I think I could have shortened this if I had found a better-suited physiotherapist from the start, but here we are.

* **Stage 1: Calming down my foot** \- just getting to a place where I wasn't in frequent pain. This took about 1-2 months.
* **Stage 2: Semi-normal** \- I could walk with some conditions, such as not longer for 1.5 hours and never speed-walking. This lasted for about 6 months.
* **Stage 3: Normal** \- I could walk for a long time (4+ hours) without foot pain. Once I found the right physiotherapist, I got from ""Semi-Normal"" to ""Normal"" within about a month, much to my total shock since I'd been stuck at ""Semi-Normal"" for so long.

**What steps worked or didn't work?**

The following ""traditional advice"" really *did* seem to help me get from Stage 1 to Stage 2. I think my foot truly needed the initial support, to become less inflamed:

* **Wearing supportive sandals inside** \- my first physio recommended Ecco Cozmos and when I stepped into those puppies, I was like holy shit. I had never worn a slipper indoors before and it felt so supportive. I do think it helped my foot not get more irritated.
* **Wearing Hoka Cliftons as my outside shoe**, instead of my slightly heeled leather boots. I could instinctively tell I needed a lower heel, and the ""rocker"" sole of the Hoka Cliftons made a huge, noticeable difference at passively strengthening my calves. I felt like I had a calf workout every time I went for a walk, without it aggravating the ball of my big toe like calf raises did. One day I will try minimalist shoes to try to strengthen my foot more, but I think the maximalist Hoka Cliftons were a really good idea for early-mid recovery.
* **Getting orthotics to correct my pronation** \- I always knew my foot kind of ""collapsed in"" when I was walking, but had never dealt with it. But as I paid more attention to my feet, I noticed that I actually craved support - I felt a need to stuff something under that side of my foot to stop it from caving in. I don't believe pronation caused my injury, but I do think it may have been a factor in why the pain was so focused on that side of my foot. Whether or not orthotics actually addressed my condition, I feel more stable walking now.
* **Wearing a Strassburg Sock at night** \- again, when I paid attention to my foot, I noticed that I kept wanting to instinctively dorsiflex it. I trusted what my body was telling me and got the sock, and it did help.
* **Massaging and gently stretching my foot** \- I noticed that this brought some relief. Truthfully I also think it helped emotionally, in helping me feel more in tune with my foot, and more caring towards it instead of angry/upset at it.
* **Toe exercises** \- this helped with some pain in Stage 1.

The following ""traditional advice"" did **NOT** work for me at any stage:

* **Calf stretches** (felt nice but seemed to do nothing)
* **Calf raises** (caused pain, just wearing the Hokas was a better way of strengthening my calves)

However, after doing all these things, I got stuck at Stage 2 for six months doing various pointless stretches. I know that for many people, Stage 2 is a great outcome - but for me, who loves walking for fairly long distances, I felt really frustrated and defeated. I decided to switch physiotherapists.

**This was the most important step I took: finding a ""detective"" style of physiotherapist** who really wanted to investigate my body instead of just giving me standard advice. This new physio enabled me to finally reach Stage 3 and consider myself fully recovered.

* With this physiotherapist, I was very clear about my priorities: I want someone to help me figure out HOW I may have been overloading my foot, and WHAT I need to do to correct it. Please don't give me calf stretches, because if that was going to work, it would have worked by now!
* We also agreed that there could be multiple roots of the problem, or multiple possibilities - so we agreed to just pursue ALL theories until something worked.
* This physio was surprised I'd been diagnosed with plantar fasciitis. He didn't have an alternate diagnosis though.

Through my work with this physio, I realized that my full chain of movement was weird on that side of my body. Basically:

* **I was taking a longer stride with one leg than the other** \- which meant I was always ""landing"" fully on that one foot (the one that became injured). That foot was taking way more of the load. It was like it was the dominant foot. This way of walking also put a LOT of pressure on my forefoot.
* **I was ""leading with my hip"" on that side** \- swinging my hip on that side loosely forward to take each step, and letting the rest of my leg be dragged along with it, instead of my hip and leg moving as a single coordinated unit. Compared to the other side of my body, it felt like that hip was much less stable/controlled. 
* **My upper body was hunching forward / crumpling while I walked**, which changed my center of gravity and contributed to me walking weirdly. When I stood more upright, I naturally took shorter strides and my hips were more ""tucked in"".
* **My strides were too long for my body's natural geometry.** When I became more attentive, I realized I was extending my legs further out than actually felt good. It also explains why speed-walking hurt more: it caused me take longer strides. My physio joked that a lot of foot ailments could be solved if people just took shorter strides.

Based on these discoveries:

* We started doing exercises to **strengthen that hip area.**
* I started **shortening my stride** as I walked.
* I try to **hold my body more upright** as I walked.

Within a month of doing this, I was able to go for 5+ hours urban hikes again without foot pain. I was completely flabbergasted at how these relatively minor changes made such a huge difference.

I guess those little problems added up to overloading my foot, to the point that it finally snapped into some kind of mystery tendonitis (maybe plantar fasciitis, maybe sesamoiditis, maybe something we have no word for).

We are still working on my entire chain, but now it's more about prevention and optimization.

**My key takeaways:**

* Listen to your body. You need to start paying serious attention it, and really give credence to whatever it tells you.
* Don't overfocus on just your foot. Your hip, core and even upper back can create a chain that affects how you walk and therefore the load on your foot.
* When you take thousands of steps a day, a relatively small ""bad form"" problem can really add up. Pay attention to how you walk - and not just your feet but your entire body.
* You don't need a diagnosis to get better.
* Find someone who can help **come up with theories** about what's driving this injury, and then **test those theories** by giving you exercises/steps that could resolve them.
* If the exercises/steps that fit a particular theory don't make a difference, **move on to another theory.**
* There is hope!!!!",2023-12-17 20:06:27+00:00,95,17

18gf3uo,sesamoid,Altra > Hoka,"I wanted to share something they helped me regarding shoes. I first got the Hoka Bondi 8 because of recommendations on this sub.

I wanted to make it work, but the toebox is so dang tight, it was actually making things worse. I was wearing a shoe insert, which made it even tighter. Even without the insert, the shoe was tight!

I don‚Äôt have a wide foot, either. Crazy.

I ordered the Altra Paradigm 7 and it is so much better. The toebox is much more roomy and it‚Äôs a zero drop shoe, so I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm putting pressure on the ball of my foot the entire time. There‚Äôs also enough room to accommodate an insert.

For some people the Hokas work; but for me they didn‚Äôt. I really wanted them to, but I needed a much wider toebox. So if you are struggling with traditional narrow toe box / big heel drop shoes, maybe a wider toebox shoe could be a solution!",2023-12-12 05:58:36+00:00,14,17

25F, 5'4, 110 pounds, United States

My wife and I recently thru-hiked 2650 miles on the Pacific Crest Trail. We are thinking about going again on Appalachian Trail or CDT. Last time the thing that really hurt both of our experiences was constant foot pain. Blisters are to be expected but we had terrible foot pain in the base of our feet. A dull ache all day. I felt it was more so than other hikers. This was even 5 months in. We went through 5 pairs of shoes each.  
Thru hikers don‚Äôt generally wear hiking boots because they need to constantly dry out shoes and let their feet breathe. They usually wear trail running shoes. We started out in Altra Lone Peaks and then switched to Hoka Speedgoats. The switch to Hoka‚Äôs was better for more padding but even towards the end of the trail the pain was terrible.  
My question is do you have any recommendations to lessen foot pain? Stretching techniques, specific shoes, should we see a specialist? Some foot pain is to be expected in this extreme situation I know. We tried using a stretching/cork ball on our feet.",2023-12-08 19:00:13+00:00,1,1

188njs2,PlantarFasciitis,I (probably) tore my plantar fascia in May. Earlier this week I played Ultimate Frisbee and felt perfectly fine afterwards. A little write up about recovering from plantar fasciitis/pf injury.,"Hiya! I wrote [this post about some pt exercises](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantarFasciitis/comments/17eaibd/4_exercises_i_got_from_my_physical_therapist_i/) a few weeks back and people seemed to appreciate it so I figured now that I'm basically at the endpoint of my recovery process I'd make another post about the whole thing in the hopes that it can be of help to someone. Since over the past 6 months I've gone from not being able to walk without pretty severe pain to being able to once again play Ultimate frisbee, a sport that involves a very large amount of sprinting, jumping and high intensity change of direction. 

About me: for context, I'm 26, very active (I exercise basically every day), and generally healthy. And I've been playing Ultimate for ages.

I started getting plantar fasciitis symptoms in late-April of this year (not totally sure why, I think it was doing a few sprint workouts on concrete in old sneakers). All the usual symptoms‚Äîpain in the morning that faded throughout the day. I kept training/playing through it since it'd get better once I warmed up. And then right at the end of May I tore my left plantar fascia. Basically I jumped and as I landed I felt a bad pain right where my arch meets my left heel and all of a sudden I basically could not push off the balls of my foot without severe pain, if at all. Basic pf symptoms persisted after this as well.

Note: the reason in my title I say probably tore is that I never got any imaging or whatever to confirm a tear (I don't have health insurance & am not paying out of pocket for an MRI). But my pt (who I'll be referring to later), thinks that the sudden onset of the moment when it got dramatically worse tracks more with a tear than with just pf, and she's smart as shit so I assume she was right about that.

Because I'm dumb I proceeded to spend nearly two months trying to play through this as well since it was right at the start of the ultimate season & as bad as it was I could still sorta run and it didn't seem to be getting any worse than it already was. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. During this time I saw a podiatrist who suggested a night splint, started experimenting with the Ratlieff protocol, and would low-dye tape my foot to get through playing workouts. Eventually I called it a season because moving so awkwardly was giving me issues with my knee/quad and also because my foot being in pain all the time was really wearing me out mentally. 

Enter Mid-August, when I began to take rehabbing seriously. I cut out all running and explosive movement from my training routine, sticking to lifting & using an exercise bike since none of that seemed to be making things worse or hindering my recovery. I was also still running the Ratlieff protocol though. This is where I was at for about a month and by mid-september I definitely felt a little better but honestly was not making much progress. Walking was easier, but still walking too much caused my foot to hurt a ton the next day, the Ratlieff protocol didn't seem to be helping or hurting, and I was nowhere near doing anything explosive. 

In mid-september, I saw a doctor of physical therapy I've seen before and this is when I started to take rehabbing *really* seriously. I started doing the exercises I describe in my prior post, as well as temporarily cutting down the amount of walking I was doing to prevent aggravating my foot (I walk *a lot*). 

I'm not going to bother repeating my old post but three big philosophical changes that I took away from seeing my pt that I think were really important:

1. Far more important than just resting was rebuilding my foot's capacity to take intense loading.

2. In addition to intensity, I needed specificity‚Äîmy big problem was that my foot was struggling with horizontal motion (walking, running), not vertical motion (jumping). I think this is why Ratlieff didn't help me much. It's too up and down, whereas I specifically needed forward & back. 

3. I should be thinking in terms of function, not pain. Ie, instead of thinking, ""I need my foot to feel better and then I can do x"" I started thinking in terms of ""When I can do x my foot will feel better"". The reduction in pain was going to follow from the restoration of function, not the other way around. Pain is much more mercurial than function (there's a million reasons why your foot might hurt, but if you can't walk you can't walk), so focusing on the latter simplified things. 

October onwards: getting back to sprinting. The rehab my pt had me doing involved immediately bringing explosive movements back into my training. At first with big soft chunky hokas, eventually progressing towards barefoot. I was slowly scaling these up for a while with an eye towards running again. By late september I was able to slowly jog pain free but sprinting is its own can of worms (it is really hard to run at top speed unless your entire body is in proper working order). For this I started with a very low volume of 25 yard 70% runs, where I tried to run with proper sprinting form, along with some slow change of direction drills (nfl combine style 5-10-5 is a really solid starting point for these). Once I could do double digit numbers of both I started introducing a very low volume of 100% sprints, and scaling up from there. Not worth going into detail here, just once you are at this point it is less a matter of healing and more a matter of retraining your body to tolerate the demand you need from it. You do that by starting small, and day to day, week to week *slowly* adding more and more volume and intensity, seeing how you feel afterwards, and taking it from there. 

My guideline (nothing revolutionary, this is the basic protocol) for adding load was this:

1. If my foot feels better or equivalent the morning after a workout as it did the morning of, then increase volume &/or speed the following workout.

2. If my foot hurts a tiny bit more the morning after, keep intensity flat but increase volume next time (for me, intensity was a much bigger leap than volume)

3. If my foot hurts a lot more the morning after, reduce volume and intensity, think about what exactly caused the aggravation (too much, too fast, etc) and how to work on that. 

And yeah, earlier this week I played a game of frisbee and my foot only felt a tiny bit sore the next morning (my hamstrings however...). 

The upshot of this very extra post is twofold‚Äîone is to make clear that it is *very possible* to go from ""my foot is fucked :("" back to ""my foot is fine :)"". And to explain some of the principles for how I got there. I think the principles are important because often (not necessarily on here‚Äîthere are some stellar posts about people who accomplished the same thing I did their own way) there's too much focus on rest and not enouch on active recovery. But I do feel like I've seen more posts about ""can I get back to being highly active?"" than posts about ""here's how I got back to be highly active!"" So I wanted to offer the latter.

Happy to answer questions about some of the specificities if folks are interested. I spend too much time on the internet and will probably be checking back in on this post throughout the weekend.

peace and love,

187hy4e,PlantarFasciitis,Can stretching *cause* PF?,"Hello there.  I have started a gentle morning stretching regime in hopes of unraveling a slightly twisted pelvis from years of asymmetric sports (alpine / hardboot snowboarding).  It has been about three months of stretching and I am making some progress in my flexibility.  

I also have very flat feet, I use custom orthotic inserts, I hike about 8 miles a week, and I run about 3 miles 1-2x a week in Hokas.  This has been my routine for 20+ years.  49YO Male, non-smoker, gluten and dairy-free diet, no alcohol, hardly any caffeine. :) 

I noticed recently that I am starting to develop pain on the bottom of my left foot (see red circle in picture), it seems more intense in the morning.  It fits a lot of the boxes of PF.  

I have never had trouble with PF and the only recent change has been the addition of my stretching regime!  Is it possible that my stretches are *causing*, or perhaps exacerbating an underlying very mild case, of PF?  

The stretches I do first thing every morning are as follows.  And these are gentle stretches, I'm not trying to push or force a stretch:

* 5 minute static hamstring stretch by laying on my back, and having my legs straight up the wall.  In reality my butt is about 1.5 feet from the wall because my hammies are very tight!  It's taken me about 3 months to get the left hammy nearly as flexible as the right one, so that now I can stretch both legs at the same time rather than doing 5 minutes on one, and then 5 minutes on the other.
* 3 minute per leg, laying gluteus stretch.  Kind of like sitting cross-legged while laying on your back, except only one leg across, and then pull knee toward chest to stretch the opposite glute.
* 5 minute child's pose.  
* 2 minute cobra pose (cuz my lower back is a mess)
* 45s Plank Pose, but instead of the traditional foot position with ankle at \~90 degrees and toes bent inward to put weight on bottoms of toes, I instead open my ankles up to \~110 degrees and push my toes outward, so the weight is on the tops of my foot & toes.  Just to help open my inflexible ankles and toes up a bit more.

That's it.  The child's pose has been the hardest because my ankles and toes are SUPER inflexible and my feet  would cramp up the instant I would relax into the pose, so then I'd have to use a towel roll under my shins, etc.  But I've finally gotten them loose enough that they hardly ever cramp up and I don't need a towel.

Not sure if I'm doing anything in my stretches that might be causing foot pain - I wanted to ask here and see what people thought.  Thank you for your time!

1874mov,sesamoid,A recovery story - Shockwave therapy and patience,"Hi all - first time posting. I don't come on reddit much/ever so please be patient if you have questions as a follow up to this post. 

Sometime in the Fall of 2022 I fractured my right fibular sesamoid. I sought treatment in Jan 2023 and was misdiagnosed first with arthritis, then again misdiagnosed in March 2023 with a bipartite sesmoid. Finally after begging a 3rd doctor, an orthopedic surgeon, for an MRI I was diagnosed with avascular necrosis of the fibular sesamoid in April 2023, but still received no diagnosis for what caused it‚Äì doc still said looked bipartite. Between fall 2022 and April 2023 I was wearing all of my same footwear, and basically doing everything wrong I possibly could because I really had no idea what was going on and was in some sort of denial the more pain I had. 

In April I was put in a walking boot and given crutches but the walking boot seemed to be making my foot worse, not better. I moved home with my parents in May 2023 because I could no longer go grocery shopping for myself/go up and down the stairs into my apartment bc the pain had become so great. At this point, I got a fourth opinion from an ortho who told me to start the whole process over and go 0% weight bearing on my affected foot for the next 6 weeks. 

I stuck with this and did absolutely no weight bearing activity for 6 weeks, honestly i stayed in bed for most of it partially bc of the instructions partially because of depression. It was during this time that i started doing twice daily contrast bathing and a hot bath at night with epsom salts which seemed to help. I was also receiving 3x/week physical therapy where i received manual PT in the form of massage, joint manipulation, and dry needling. The manual manipulation was the most helpful to reintroduce movement to the joint imo. The dry needling also seemed to help incrementally but was extremely painful. This is not available everywhere and was an added cost to the regular PT. I also rented an exogen bone stimulator out of pocket and was doing this 20 mins/day.  
Around the 3 week mark of no weight, I introduced foot yoga and resistance band exercises. I included some links below. I still do this about every other day and credit it a ton. I got rid of all of my restrictive footwear and bought a pair of vivo barefoot oxfords, chaco sandals, and altra trail runners. These in addition to danskos are the only shoes i wore for months. Danskos were my fail safe as the rocker on the bottom alleviated the joint flexion that had pretty much become totally impossible at this point.  
I remained with my folks through mid July, slowly introducing more intense calf and hip stretching and leveling up my activity through incremental weight bearing. I met with the ortho again who refused me additional imaging and basically said, return to normal activity, if it starts hurting again get it removed. Pretty crushing.   
I decided I had to get back to my life so i threw one last hail mary and called a doctor around NYC I found from Richard Blake's healing sole blog, Dr. Conenello at Orangetown Podiatry. I knew I wanted to try shockwave therapy and everywhere else i called quoted me at $500-800 for a consultation and $400/session no insurance. Orangetown not only took my insurance but had a lower cost per session than the competitiors. Most importantly they took me seriously and even the receptionist knew what sesamoiditis is and how debilitating the process and injury can be. It was the first moment of hope I felt in the whole process. 

I bawled at session #1 as Dr. Conenello actually listened to my experience and without needing to beg or plead ordered me updated imaging, and MRI with and without contrast, something all the previous doctors vehemently refused me. I was finally diagnosed with a fractured sesamoid. The shockwave therapy was extremely painful for the first session, but got easier and easier. I had 5 sessions of EMTT and ESWT that totaled somewhere around $1300. They also made me custom inserts that I'll be honest, I'm not the best at wearing but when I do, completely offload my sesamoid without a cut out, by supporting the tendons in my arch. 

Fast forward to now, I lift, I walk, I have resumed to normal, relatively pain free life‚Äì this is something I couldn't conceive in April. My last MRI showed further damage to the sesamoid, but as Dr. Conenello says, what does it matter if you're feeling better. My pain rarely goes above a 1 and I'm starting to get used to the chronic ache. I will have a few more shockwave sessions in the new year and imagine I will need them intermittently as time goes on to further help repair the joint capsule. 

There's a lot of stuff i'm missing here, its hard to remember it all as an injury that lasts so long and is such a mental load, its kind of nice to forget it. I'm happy to answer questions about it though! And, a final note: I was offered surgery 3 times before receiving a correct diagnosis. In my experience and from what I've seen online DON'T DO IT UNLESS YOU HAVE EXHAUSTED EVERY OTHER OPTION. Shockwave therapy is the way! Sending healing to you all! Resource list below:

186geq5,Sneakers,Christmas gift for Mom and Dad - suggestions please!,"I haven't ever given a serious attention to sneakers but I am just learning to. I want to give my mom and dad new sneakers for walking. I see lot of options reading through the subs but its getting confusing as well. The challenge is my parents are in a third world country and I need to buy something here in the US and take it home for Christmas. 

My parents are simple people, they will be happy with just about anything - but I want to treat them well for all the things they did for me. Here are some quick details

**Age**: 60s and diabetic

**purpose**: walking/ general - maybe 2-3 hours a day

**other**: mom has knee pain. Comfort and stability top priority. Style is secondary. I am unable to assess if they need pronate/supinate. I don't think there are doctors around that care so much about these stuff near home. Maybe a little support will be good?

**shoes I am considering so far**: ultraboost, NB 1080, Hoka Bondi. 

**Budget**: Preferably <$130. I can stretch to $160 (my parents are going to be mad lol! but they deserve some good quality shoes). 

I got their foot length and width. Mom may need wide shoes. I know it is not ideal way to buy shoes - just hoping for the best.

182gu1h,XXRunning,Running shoe brands for very small feet?,"Hi! First time posting here. 

I'm a casual runner that does 5-7k (twice a week) - 10-12k (once a week). Am hoping to train for a half marathon + trail run so is looking for new shoes. So the thing is, I have unusually small adult feet - US4 / EU35 / UK2 / 21cm. I can go about doing my daily run in kids running shoes but finding it difficult to as I push for distance. I normally do a size or a size and a half up but that requires me to have super thick socks. And sizing up that much makes me feel unstable on a run.

Are there any running shoe manufacturers out there that actually produces small sizes that are not kid's running shoes? They are really uncomfortable to run in long distances and they aren't as durable compared to the adult ones from what I read and experienced.

I really like the Hoka/salomons designs but I'm kind of in mercy of what are available out there that won't ruin my feet. The current running shoes I have is a New Balance. I guess I could stick with the same brand but would like to explore if there are any available options out there.

Do you all have ideas or experiences?

Sneakers for every day wear: this is probably the easiest. Started with Brooks Beast, and have had success with Brooks Adrenaline and Vionics as well. Brooks seems to be put of my size (11.5 wide for them, 11.5 regular for most) whenever I look though. Trying to avoid the look of Hokas, just want plain, neutral sneakers if possible.

Dressier shoes for office wear: I spend about half my time at a desk and half on my feet. Very casual dress, so I can get away with sneakers many days. But some days I'm in a suit or blazer, and typically want something more formal for shoes. No idea here. Last time I made due with something generic with Vionic inserts, but I had to cut the inserts to make them fit and they squeaked with every step haha.

Sandals: for home wear. I had (again) Vionic slip on sandals, which they don't seem to sell. Years ago I had Birkenstocks when I was just recovering from PF, but I'm not a fan of the rock hard sole.

17xwq7k,AskDocs,Podiatry: Shoe recommendation?,"31M 300lbs 6'1"" ankle instability.  


Had a subtalar coalition that resulted in a subtalar fusion and now pretty unstable on uneven ground. Originally I noticed I was walking a bit more on the outside of my foot post fusion. Got orthotics, but when used with my current shoes (Hoka Ones ie cushy rocker bottoms I got for the arthritis) they make it even worse as most of my weight seems to shift to the outside of my foot and I constantly feel like I'm about to roll my ankle. Brought this up to my orthopedic and they said that my lack of subtalar joint mobility may have caused my ankle joint to accommodate some of that motion  
He said to avoid shoes that have wide/flared bases as the leverage would work against me. A shoe place was recommended, but they were closed that day and the 4 hour commute is difficult..... I am trying to get through the break in wearing them as the rigid arches are pretty uncomfortable, but I am too worried about injuring my ankle to wear them.

Are there any types of shoes that work well for this type of issue? Specifically with the rigid orthotics? I have issues finding footwear to begin with as a 14W to I'm not sure if lower rise shoes are okay? Do I want to stick more to boots for more ankle support?

Comfort in the shoe is absolutely vital. I want to wear the speedgoats forever, but I don't want to buy a new pair every, single, year. **I can't get 400 miles out of a pair** and the pinky and big toe blow out the show, both sides, each pair I've had. Often by 200 miles or sooner. I'm not trail running, only backpacking and I would definitely say I apply medium stress to the shoe in terms of the environments I hike in.

Is it ok to wear trail runners? (I like the Hoka Speedgoat 5s.) I did the Camino de Santiago in them and did fine. I am just worried about how rocky the trail might be and whether hiking boots might be a better fit. I know there is a whole debate about trail runners v boots.

17upzco,PlantarFasciitis,I finally found comfortable shoes!,"I recently got 2 pairs of shoes that have been working out so well I wanted to tell you about them.

The first are sneakers: Merrell Antora 3. I can walk all day with these. They have a nice wide toe box & I don‚Äôt even have
to remove the footbed. My custom orthotics go right on top & they fit perfectly.

The other is Dansko Paisley. These are more of a walking shoe (I wanted something that didn‚Äôt look like sneakers). For these, I have to remove the footbed to fit my orthotics. I don‚Äôt even want to take these off at the end of the day, they feel that good. (By ‚Äúgood,‚Äù I mean normal, like I did before I started getting PF 9 months ago.)

These have been better than any of the multitudes of shoes I‚Äôve tried, including Hokas.

17uept9,PlantarFasciitis,ICU Nurse: PF and hokas only made it worse,"Plantar fasciitis: hokas only made it worse. New shoe recommendations?

Hey all. Im a ICU nurse  who's been dealing with some pretty terrible PF. I always have had issues when my shoes got old but it normally resolved with a new pair. I went to a running store (fleet feet)  who did all their analysis. I have a very high arch. They suggested the Hoka arashi 6 (high cushion , stability). They initially felt great but the end of the day was terrible. Got a pair of Hoka Clifton 9s. (high cushion , no stability) six months later and it was better but I still hobble after working two days. Im thinking it has to do with the high stack hight of the heel as well as the arch support being too much.i tried all the insoles at fleet feet and they all hurt like crazy. i stretch daily and do the exercises that a PT friend suggested. It helps but doesn't cure.

I'm thinking of going back to my old faithful new balance. I always used to wear the dad mowing the lawn model but think I can do better üòÇ

Anyone have any experience with PF and the 880s or 1080s? Other recommendations are appreciated

17u3erf,FootFunction,Odds that new shoes could cause a stress fracture (5th metatarsal),"This last couple months had seen me go from hiking, walking, and normal life to basically home/office bound. 

I‚Äôve been having plantar fasciitis like symptoms in both feet. PT has been treating the soft tissue, but also my lower back which has 2 herniated discs. 

Whatever the cause, I‚Äôve been trying tons of new shoes. My old standbys are Brooks Ghost with stock insoles. But I‚Äôve been trialing  a pair of Hoka Cliftons and Asics Gel Nimbus 25 with custom arch support insoles. 

While wearing the Hokas the other day I noticed the outer part of my 5th MT start hurting. Someone I feel pain closer to the ankle but not often. This only got worse with the Asics,maybe because they are really soft. 

I don‚Äôt run, only walk. I‚Äôm not overweight and I eat very healthy. 

Afraid of a stress fracture, but that would seem extreme simply from a change in footwear and more arch support.  

What are the odds this is soft tissue/nerve vs a bone issue?

Thanks

So I made a post in another sub looking for what running shoes to get, but it produced little results so I‚Äôm hoping I have more luck here. I‚Äôm anatomically flat footed (have always had flat feet) with a wide foot and I pronate with a duck footed stance. I‚Äôve tried the brooks adrenaline and they were decent but still ended up hurting, I tried the kayanos but they hurt my inner arch and the outside of my foot, and most recently I tried the Hoka Arahi 6 but that killed my inner arch and gave me shin splints as well. I‚Äôm at a loss and I‚Äôm very frustrated I can‚Äôt find a decent shoe that makes running not hurt. I don‚Äôt mind the muscle pains and I expect them but it‚Äôs the foundational pain I struggle with.

17ta22l,AskDocs,Help! CRPS? Neuropathy? Need a solution‚Ä¶,"33M - 180 pounds - 6‚Äô2 - very active. Working out 4-5 times a week. Desk job but on feet often.

I am facing a giant battle daily. I am to the point I have no where to turn and don‚Äôt know what to do.
I have been to: 2 Neurologists, 2 Podiatrist, 2 Orthopedic Surgeons, 1 Rheumatologist.

My whole life off and on I have had severe headaches, and blacking out sometimes when I stand up. I will see stars, or completely black out and fall to the floor. The blacking out is not daily but does happen several times a week.
Bowel movements are every 2-3 days.
Severe redness in hands and feet sometimes with color changes to red or white. Also extreme temperature changes in hands and feet either very cold or hot. Sometimes it can be just a few toes or fingers.

Fast forward to 2020.
Started walking 2-5 miles daily.
Developed very tough calluses under 5th met heads on feet. All my weight shifting to that point and severe redness. Cutting callused areas down, fit with custom orthotics, hokas, doesn‚Äôt matter. No relief.
Pain is 6.5 out of 10. And to the point I can no longer walk recreationally. Now accompanied by burning and tingling in both feet. So, I have multiple cortisol injections in both feet and find relief! I can function and walk again! Only for a week to 10 days at most. Time to see if we can move the mechanics of the foot and change things according to the orthopedic surgeon. 

Have surgery in August of 2023. 

LEFT FIRST METATARSAL OSTEOTOMY, FIFTH METATARSAL PLANTAR CONDYLECTOMY performed on 1 foot to see if it helps.

I am now worse than before.
The pain in my feet is almost unbearable. I am having constant tingling, burning, and shooting pains in both feet. Now the pain is 9 out of 10.

Testing revealed low or no read in the bottoms of my feet on nerve study (EMG? Maybe) 

All labs are completely normal. 5 times.

Everyone else is at a complete loss.
2 doctors have mentioned CRPS.
Neurologist has not mentioned neuropathy even though symptoms match in my opinion. 
I have mentioned Fabry as well.

Currently taking gabapentin 300mg 4 times daily. It is helping take the pain from a 9 to a 7 or 8 at most. It‚Äôs more or less making me sleepy in a complete daze. 


Is there anything that someone can think of that would provide answers and relief? 

Please and thank you for taking the time to read this.",2023-11-12 02:04:38+00:00,0,3

**New Shoes**

* [Newton Running Isaac](https://www.newtonrunning.com/products/mens-isaac) (M8.5) - Brand new. I had a Newton gift card from like 8 years ago that they (generously) allowed me to redeem‚Ä¶ but I still don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to get to these. That said, the new Isaac _is_ a more traditional-platformed shoe and while it does have lugs, they are markedly smaller than in the past. Reviews on these seem really great? I‚Äôm just asking what I paid out of pocket which is ~~$80~~ **$70.**
* [Diadora Atomo v7000](https://www.diadora.com/en/us/atomo_v7000_w/101.179068_D0250.html) (W10.5, _Note edited sizing!_) - Brand new! I bought these to wear casually (the women‚Äôs and men‚Äôs fit the same, and I thought the women‚Äôs colorway looked a lot cooler), but never got around to it. Boy these Diadora are made well, and you‚Äôll pay for it at retail ($240 MSRP!). I‚Äôm asking ~~$120~~ **$100**.
* ~~[Craft Nordlite Speed](https://www.craftsports.us/products/mens-nordlite-speed-running-shoe?variant=42397928063152) (M8*) - Brand new! These are marked as an 8.5 but for much closer to an 8.0 (or, of course, a women‚Äôs 9.5 or so). This is a new super shoe (racing shoe!) from Craft, with next-gen foam and a carbon plate.~~ Asking ~~$120~~ **Sold!**.
* ~~[Brooks Launch 10](https://www.brooksrunning.com/en_us/mens-launch-10-road-running-shoes/110409.html) (M8.5) - Brand new, and just not a shoe I really need‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, I bought them with a Fleet Feet gift card, thinking I‚Äôd use them for faster runs but I just wear Invincibles for half my mileage anyway these days.~~ Asking ~~$75~~ **Sold!**.
* ~~[Salomon Aero Volt](https://www.salomon.com/en-us/shop/product/aero-volt-li3157.html) (M8.5) - Brand new! Great for summer running, but with a durable outsole that makes me think about cross-country. I‚Äôve already worn through a pair of these and am a huge fan.~~ Asking ~~$80~~ **Sold!**.

**(Slightly) Used Shoes**

MSRP on these (carbon-plated, super-foamed!) shoes is only $120, so this is one of the best deals in racing shoes! Some minor wear to the lateral edge which must be my foot strike.~~ Asking ~~$90~~ **Sold!***

* ~~[Hoka Cielo Road](https://www.hoka.com/en/us/all-gender-footwear/cielo-road/1143490.html) (M8.5, $160, 16 miles) - These are the only shoes here that have actually been worn on runs (do people using their running shoes for that?!). I used them for two road workouts - they‚Äôre awesome! Also, I have 4 AlphaFlys in their box. Thus, I just need to cut my number of racing shoes/flats.~~ Asking ~~$80~~ **Sold!**.

The event will start at 5 pm in northeast Florida.

17p4ndh,bunions,Shoes for bunions - help & advice needed,"Hi, I recently realised that the bunion on my right foot is getting really bad. I can't even wear socks without feeling pain. I've bought Allbirds and Vivobarefoot based on the reviews given here but I've had to return them as they were not wide enough. Allbirds had the right length but the toe box is still not wide enough. Vivobarefoot was too narrow even after upgrading a size. Recently, I bought Skechers wide and so far the toe box is really comfortable. Unfortunately, the shoe is too long, even after I had taken a half size smaller. My heel kept getting out of the box. But I was desperate for a wider toebox so I bought it. Unfortunately it's making me get additional issues such as ankle/calf pain and pain in my left foot (where the bunion is less developed). So I would be returning it soon (before the 45 day limit)

I've scheduled for a GP's appointment in the next couple of weeks but I suspect I won't be able to see a podiatrist for another couple of weeks or even months. I'm new to the UK and I know that there are a lot of shoes for wide feet but somehow I feel like I also need proper arch support.

Please can anyone tell me if any of these brands are good i.e. really wide toebox (I suspect I'm a 4E) but narrow at the back (38/38.5 EU size), or if you have any additional suggestions? I need a new pair of shoes ASAP... and so tired of returning shoes :( also need boots for the winter months, so might be better if the shoe is warmer.

1. Calla
2. Hoka - I heard the Hoka 8(?) is good but they don't have my size online... where can I get them from physical stores in the UK?
3. Fitville UK

I've found that whenever I""ve done this, this has led to my other toes that are now on ""elevated"" ground to feel irritated - almost more so than the relief that it provides to the seasmoid.  


By contrast, I've actually found the swelling in my sesamoid to go down over these past few months (since the onset of the injury in late August) simply by wearing my Hokas around without doing any offloading via dancer's pads/cut-outs and the like...  


Just wondering if I'm the only one for whom offloading/dancer's pads seem to cause more issues than they solve?

Recently I started having foot pain below big toe. I don‚Äôt remember how it started - it‚Äôs either due to changing my running shoes from Adidas to hoka speedgoat (which is really unheard of since hoka is recommended for good cushioning) or just stress from running in general or due to all birds shoes I started using regularly. The podiatrist took some X-rays and told it‚Äôs not sesamoid fracture but the bone and the tendon could be stressed. I am recommended to be in boots for 3 weeks and it‚Äôs been a week so far. I am really struggling to not move much. I miss running and I wonder if I can ever run without fear again. I read some horror stories of sesamoid injuries online and for even more scared.

as for my question: the best shoe I've found by far are fitflops. they never come off at home, and even with me being active my feet don't hurt until the end of the day. i obviously can't wear them to work, and it's getting colder at home. is there a closed toe shoe with a similar build? or another insert i can try for both heel and arch support?",2023-10-24 19:10:25+00:00,3,1

i finished bunion surgery back in January.

my Toes still feel pain from time to time despite having had surgery. but way way better, anyway..

if i go a shoe shop.. some workers don't even know what bunions are when i mention it so any confidence i have in them for new shoes immediately drops and i will say ""i'll think about it and run away"" (no blame on them just i'm not sure there advice will be there).

i look at websites but i question if i am going backwards or not from my current shoes. a lot of sites say Bondi 7 is already the best in terms of comfort.

but are they the best for toe support? not sure.

i also question whether or not the websites are paid sponsors too list them as the best.

17e09iw,bunions,4 months post-op progress!,"After a long two years of suffering from bunion pain that stopped me from living my life, going to work, and enjoying my hobbies like hiking, trail running, and dancing, I am happy to say that I‚Äôm finally fully healed! 

Over the course of the past year, my podiatrist and I have entirely exhausted all conservative options for managing my bunion, including pain meds, physical therapy, splinting, acupuncture, and steroid injections. Back in February 2023, he told me it was time to think about surgery and I was insanely reluctant. I went through 4 more months and 2 rounds of steroid injections before I decided I was fed up and I wanted to be able to get back to the activities I enjoy, to live a normal life again. As a hypochondriac, I was absolutely terrified of surgery and how anesthesia would affect me, but my podiatrist has been insanely supportive and reassuring the entire time and I finally pulled the trigger in June and had the surgery. 

The first few days after surgery were awful. The leg block wore off within 2 hours after surgery for me because my body is insanely fast at processing drugs. I was prescribed Tylenol 3 and it didn‚Äôt do anything for the pain: I suffered for two whole days before I finally decided to call the doctors‚Äô office and request something stronger. They prescribed me Percocet that I only had to take for one day and I was good to go by day 4 post-op. I was on crutches for the first 3 days, then was able to resume walking and going to work by day 4.

I started PT after 2 months and only had to go for 4 weeks before I was finally able to hike, run, and dance again. Per my podiatrist‚Äôs recommendation, I bought a pair of Hoka Bondi 8‚Äôs and they have been absolutely amazing for recovery. I am happy to say that I‚Äôm finally back to doing everything I love and walking 10 miles a day with no pain! 

For those of you really struggling right now, I promise it gets better!",2023-10-22 18:48:47+00:00,11,7

177s4ou,Marathon_Training,Shoe Emergency 1 week out,"Little backstory. I have been running semi consistently for 4 years and am doing my first marathon in one week (Kansas City). During these 4 years the only running shoe I have used were the Brooks Levitates. I have been through 3 pairs of the version 2s and 2 pairs of the version 4s. My plan this training block was to stick with the same model shoes. As I was approaching 400 milesin my shoes I went to order some more off of Amazon and they only had the version 5s of the levitate 2s available so I went ahead and ordered them thinking they would be similar.

When they arrived I made it through one 6 mile run and the shoes were functionally different. The heel fit was completely different and put a large amount of stress on my big toes. I decided to go to a running store and got fitted for some hoka mach5s and fell in love with them. They were lighter than my brooks levitates and it reminded me of taking the warm up donut off of a baseball bat when you were swinging it. Anyhow I made it through my peak week of training block with the Hokas ( 40 mile week with a 20 mile long run) and everything felt great. The morning after my long run I went for a 4 mile recovery run and the tendon right below my ankle on the outside of my left foot was in complete agony once I finished my run. I put on some other shoes to go weight lifting and didn‚Äôt feel any pain so I didn‚Äôt think too much of it.

A few days later I was going for another 4 miler and I had the same pain the second I put the Hokas on. Out of curiosity I put on my old brooks and the pain went away completely. I have done the runs of my taper week with my brooks and have had no issues but the problem is that these are nearing 450 miles of total mileage on them and I am a week away from the marathon.

Part of me thinks I just put too many miles too quickly in an unfamiliar pair of shoes. I will see what my short run on Monday feels like but I debating whether to go to a running store and get fitted for another pair of shoes or just stick out out with the brooks even though they have noticeable wear.

(Edit): also pro tip for newbies‚Ä¶ get your shoe situation sorted before even thinking about starting a training block. Buy 2 pairs at least if you are fond of a particular model

UPDATE: found a pair of the levitate 4s on ebay that are ‚Äúlightly used‚Äù lol. I am overnighting them so they should be here in Wednesday. I will try and do a shakeout run with them before the marathon. Thank you everyone.",2023-10-14 15:31:33+00:00,6,10

17791p0,hiking,Nepal Three Passes Trek + Trail Shoes,"I'm planning to do Everest Three Passes hike in December this year with a friend and am debating choice of foot wear.

Some context:  
Since a couple of years I'm doing all my hikes (e.g. Alta Via 2 in the Alps, GR20 in Corsica, Lofoten crossing in Norway) in regular Hoka Speedgoats 4/5's and absolutely love hiking with them. I always use a merinowool liner and merinowool hike sock. When wetter I use Bridgedale stormsocks. I've already used it with microspikes to cross mild snowy/icy terrain. Whenever they get wet it doesn't bother me at all due to good moist management of merino wool socks + trail shoes dry very fast. Also never had any problems with ankle support despite a moderately heavy backpack.

All the above of course are not the Himalayas, let alone in the winter, where I'm fully aware it can get VERY cold, so we're also fully preparing for that -plenty of down gear, warm sleeping bag, layering....

Hence also my question. Any advice from people with similar experiences would be most welcome. Does this combo (Hoka Speedgoat 5 + Merino Wool Liner + Merino Wool socks + Storm socks if needed + Microspikes) seem doable for the three Passes Hike in December, or should I strongly consider alternatives?

Thanks for the advice!

update:

I went with Hoka Speedgoat 5 and would definitely recommend.

However keep in mind:

\*Only do it when you‚Äôre familiar and comfortable hiking with trailshoes and a heavy backpack, or trailshoes in Alpine/rocky environments.  
\*I did bring warm waterproof socks just in case (didn‚Äôt really need them but was nice as a backup)\*I did have microspikes for the icy glacier part.  
\*we went in December, so it was very dry and cold (ie frozen rather than wet). But if more mud waterproof socks should help you out or else you can dry your shoes at the stove in the evening).

My feet feel best barefoot; any closed toe shoes leave me in immense pain except for Crocs (bought a pair for the airport for ease with TSA and ended up being the only shoes I can use to walk my kid to daycare ten blocks). Luckily I WFH so I am barefoot most of the day and experience no pain at all.

I tried Hoka Bondi and Brooks Glycerin, with and without metatarsal pads, and they left my feet burning. During the summer I lived in my Teva hurricanes and I had minimal pain. I‚Äôd wear my Oofos and had no pain. I‚Äôve had two cortisone injections; one in April and one last week.

I finally measured my foot width and it seems I might have had wide feet all along and that was the culprit.

I‚Äôm looking for shoe recommendations for someone who lives in a city and walks about 3 miles daily. I‚Äôm about to bite the bullet on the Kuru Quantum 2. I‚Äôm just nervous because everything seems to say you need lots of support in a shoe, but it seems the more support my feet get, the more they hurt.

Any other suggestions?",2023-09-27 14:15:45+00:00,4,14

16r83hk,walking,Shoes for distance walking on vacation/flat feet/bunion,"I have problem feet!  They are flat to the point that a high arch in a shoe will hurt, I pronate, I have a great big bunion but overall do not have wide feet.  So typically need a standard width but with a not-too-narrow toe box.  Shoes that are ""good"" for flat feet or over-pronators are often not for me because shoes with a lot of support will hurt and even cause blisters.  I mostly look for shoes that barely touch my feet, unfortunately.  But there are several circumstances where that doesn't work, like winter (snow boots that aren't too snug or Converse if no snow on the ground) ... or travel, where I expect to talk 8-10 miles a day, in cooler weather (in the summer, I stick with the shoes that barely touch my feet).

So, I'm going to a cold, rainy destination this winter and expect to be walking outside a lot.  I feel like a need shoes designed for this.  Obviously, I see Hokas and OnClouds everywhere, though my research leans way on the Hoka side.  

Here's the deal:

1. Comfort is everything
2. I will never run in these shoes, though I may power walk
3. Generous toe box and NOT a ton of arch support

Thoughts?  Bondi 8s have very mixed reviews on the toe box.  They also seem to be cushioned but not bouncy.  I'm a fan of bouncy.  Asics Gel Contend?  I am open to going to a running store, but it is super hard to find all the sizes and widths in stock, would prefer to order a bunch online.

Appreciate any advice!  I know it may take some trial and error, but I'd like start out in the correct ballpark.",2023-09-24 20:38:49+00:00,3,1

16q81wt,PlantarFasciitis,Are there any low-profile/flat-soled skater shoe-type sneakers that are actually supportive?,"I know PF isn't caused, nor can it be treated, by shoes. But I am very partial to the look and feel of my flat-soled sneakers (for ex, the reebok club c 85), and after using them nonstop every day for the past two years while walking heavily in nyc, I cant help but think the lack of support might have contibuted to me developing PF. I am taking a break from them and walking around in Hokas for now. But does anyone know of any casual, flat-soled sneakers that are more supportive in the soles or in the inserts? The only one's I've found that mention any added support are the vans comfycush. 

For reference, I do all the exercises, go to PT, roll my arches, ice etc. I also plan on getting insoles at some point as well, if that matters. ",2023-09-23 15:57:13+00:00,5,12

16p2lgc,PlantarFasciitis,Been suffering for 6 months üò´üò´,"I just found this reddit but I have been suffering for plantar fasciitis for 6 months üò´üò´

Ever since I started working as a nurse here in US in the ortho floor where I average to about 10,000 steps a day, 3-4x a week, my heel has begun to hurt. The very very stark symptom is heel pain right when I get up from bed. That heel pain‚Äôs just too painful. I even bought Hoka shoes Gaviota 5 thinking that it must be from the shoes, but still it‚Äôs still hurting. It also doesn‚Äôt help that at 29 years old, my BMI is 38 and I walk a lot at work when I am not that athletic. My previous work was desk job so I guess I had that shock from desk job to 15,000 steps. üò´üò´

I sometimes do the frozen water bottles and roll my foot on those when I arrive from work, it helped a bit but it‚Äôs just a cycle. Work then pain then rest and relief from pain, then work and pain.
And now, it has reached the point that even at work I am just in severe pain. üò´üò´

How have you dealt with your plantar fasciitis? 
Have you totally healed from it? 

I am new in this reddit so I will also be doing some backreading.

While I am training in Hokas right now, I‚Äôve always been a fan of Nike shoes - I know they don‚Äôt last very long and aren‚Äôt necessarily great for training, but they‚Äôve always been the comfiest to me.

16nsb7p,Sneakers,Sneaker head in need of help/advice,"Hey y‚Äôall, so I have been a sneaker head all of my life but over the last few years I have been noticing that all of my sneakers are too tight in the toe box. I‚Äôve always had a wide foot but over the last few years it has gotten wider and no matter what shoe I put on it feels too tight for my toes especially when I try to walk. 
I went from wearing Jordan‚Äôs, Adidas forums, Yeezys (although I always had issues with those being too tight) and boots to wearing exclusively crocs because nothing else would accommodate my foot, everything else hurt after being on my feet for several hours. 
I need a pair of shoes I can wear for walks as well as for working retail on my feet for 8 hours a day. I have tried hokas and even the widest were fine in the mid foot, but way too tight in the toes. Then I tried Altras, as disappointed as I was by the aesthetics they were a bit better, but even the lone peak 7 wide are too tight and don‚Äôt allow my toes to splay enough as I walk. I bought Birkenstocks and they were okay for a month or two but now the footbed is too narrow for my pinky toe despite being a ‚Äúwide‚Äù shoe. My foot has been acting like a goldfish, growing wider to fit whatever I put it in and even crocs are uncomfortable after a full day of work at this point.
I didn‚Äôt know where to go or who to ask. Google just shows me ads. I‚Äôve been to all the shoe stores in my area and I‚Äôm in a decent sized city, and nothing fits comfortably so I figured I‚Äôd ask you guys. Any help would be awesome. Thank you!

TL;DR looking for a shoe that is made for foot health not for necessarily for aesthetics, something that allows plenty of room for toes to splay when walking and the foot to move naturally. 
Barefoot shoes aren‚Äôt an option because I‚Äôm on concrete all day so I need some cushioning, but nothing I‚Äôve tried works. Crocs, Birkenstocks, blundstones, altras, and hokas are all too narrow in the toe box for my feet even in their widest options.",2023-09-20 18:15:21+00:00,1,6
16mxo6c,AskDocs,Hallux Rigidus toe pain causing ankle issues - will I ever walk normally again?,"Hi everyone! I wanted to reach out to this group as I've been struggling with pain and lack of mobility in my right side great toe for a little over a year and a half now. I initially was told that it was turf toe and that it should heal up within 6-8 weeks on its own. 4 months after this, it still hurt just the same and so I went to a different doctor to have it assessed. That doctor referred me to a podiatrist who then told me that it was arthritis in the joint and told me to ""just stop walking"" since that's what makes it hurt. He also told me to take some oral cortisone pills. He also sold me some footbeds that he cut material out from below the big toe joint (MTP joint) in order to help limit movement of the toe (I didn't notice any difference from using these). I was told that if that didn't work I would need to fuse the joint. I'm 28 years old (was 27 at the time) and do not want to do something that extreme at my age since I am a very active person who likes to do a lot of hiking, backpacking, running, rock climbing, mountain biking, and backcountry skiing. I was told to go see an orthopedist, so I went to that appointment and was recommended Voltaren gel since it was a local ""arthritic joint"". I tried that for a little over a month and saw no change. I then returned to the same provider and was given a cortisone injection into the joint. This helped to reduce pain slightly for a few months, but I still had very limited range of motion and would get occasional onsets of moderate pain. I also got some new shoes with rockered soles that would have less flex in the toe area (Hoka Bondi 7), and these have helped slightly but not enough to really fix anything. For a while, I ended up cutting back a lot on walking and mostly just biking places with stiff, clipless-style biking shoes. This helped my toe and I wasn't thinking about it quite as much, but lately it has been hurting a lot again so I went in to see another podiatrist. This one took more X-ray angles and checked both sides, saying that both sides had the roughly shaped metatarsal head (thinking this was just how they grew as opposed to something caused by trauma to the right foot). He also mentioned that there was some extra growth on the upper of the metatarsal head that is the cause of the pain and limited ROM. He mentioned that his first thought was to prescribe me some custom orthotics in order to keep my feet in a more arched position (I have pretty flat feet), but that the next step would be for him to perform a cheilectomy to remove the excess bone growth from the metatarsal head. He also mentioned the possibility of the joint fusion but noted that it probably wasn't necessary to do that yet. 

I'm scheduled to get an MRI in about a month to check the status of the cartilage in the joint. 

Do any of you have any recommendations for how I should proceed in this situation? I've done a bit of reading and have found widely varying reviews from people who have had the various procedures done (chielectomy, joint fusion, etc) and while some people regret waiting to have it done, others regret doing it at all. For anyone who has this issue or has treated it or is otherwise familiar with it, is there anything else that I should know? 

I'm getting a bit scared because now I am starting to have pain in my ankle due to the way my gait has changed. I haven't consciously made any changes to the way I walk, but naturally my body has been walking on the outside of my right foot to avoid weighting/bending that right side great toe joint. I'm worried that continuing like this will cause other issues with my ankle, knee, hip, and back - so I want to correct the root of the issue so I can walk normally and not be in pain all the time. 

Is there anything I can do? I'm starting to get very discouraged with my options and from reading a lot of reports from others who have had the surgery (cheilectomy to remove excess growth or the joint fusion) - I'm not fully convinced that one of these will actually help my case. And I don't want to do something that is going to cost me thousands of dollars and put me out of activity for a few months just to have no improvement and to require another surgery not that much later. 

I have some x-rays that I could likely scan in if that would be helpful at all. Just let me know if this would be of benefit to add to the post. 

As someone who likes to spend my free time being active in the outdoors, it's been pretty depressing to see the bleak outlook for my toe. A lot of reports that I read were from people who didn't mention being very active. I don't feel like I need to be able to go run a full marathon after the surgery, but being able to run 5-10 miles once or twice a week would be amazing. Is this realistically something that I can expect to ever be able to do again? Even just walking around at home or at work can be quite painful now (whether due to my toe or my ankle at this point), and I worry that this could severely affect the rest of my life as far as being able to walk (the most basic form of mobility) or remain active in any of the other activities that I enjoy. 

Thank you all in advance for any and all information. Anything helps at this point.",2023-09-19 17:54:03+00:00,1,1
16mq53k,CaminoDeSantiago,My reflections and advice after walking the Camino from Le√≥n,"My partner and I walked the Camino together. Leading up to it, I was busy with work right until the last minute. I did some light training, and we worked together to plan out our daily routes and pack efficiently. Whereas I didn't have much time to do research beforehand, she did read about other people's experiences and managed to form some expectations. I entered the Camino with barely any.

This post covers my personal experience and reflections, based on notes I took during the journey and now that it's over. Scroll to the end for the tips I wish I'd known before starting the Camino; they might end up being helpful for anyone planning a similar route. Keep in mind, these are just my personal experiences, and your mileage may vary (literally and figuratively).

We walked the Camino Frances route starting from Le√≥n, which ended up totalling about 311 km (193.2 miles). We walked that in 13 days, so that‚Äôs an average of just under 24 km per day (14.9 miles per day).  For us, that pace proved to be the perfect balance of challenge and progress. It meant that we could complete the Camino within our designated time frame of two weeks, but also that we wouldn't be pushing ourselves too hard too soon. Along the way, we stayed in a combination of shared and private rooms to get some privacy every now and again and rest from the constant physical and mental presence of other pilgrims.

Our first overnight stop was at Urbanizacion Camino Santiago, located just outside Villadangos del P√°ramo. After a gruelling first day, which happened to be during the tail end of a heatwave, we opted for a private room there. Here, we discovered the concept of the ‚Äúmen√∫ del d√≠a‚Äù, which we highly recommend taking advantage of at any restaurant along your route. It's an affordable and convenient way to fuel up after burning so many calories throughout the day. For around ‚Ç¨12-14, you'll typically get a satisfying starter, main course, and coffee. But I wouldn't recommend stopping at this particular spot as there was hardly anything around. It wasn't until later that we realized that Villadangos del P√°ramo was only another 1.3 km (0.8 miles) away. If you're passing through, head there instead, as it has useful amenities like a supermarket and restaurants to choose from. 

Our next stop was San Justo de la Vega. This leg of the journey was where we finally left the roads and started to see the beautiful scenery we'd been looking forward to. Passing through Villares de √ìrbigo was particularly delightful. But I wouldn't stop at San Justo de la Vega if you can help it. We found every amenity to be closed and the sole accommodation in town, to put it mildly, subpar. We had planned to leave at 06:30 but were unable to do so because no one at reception was awake. This mishap served as a reminder that private rooms might not always be the best option, but thankfully, this wasn't the case for the rest of our trip.

The next town we passed through was El Ganso, via Astorga. Astorga was the first place that truly felt like a truly worthwhile sight to see, thanks in part to Gaudi's incredible palace there. This is also the last significant town until Ponferrada, which is over 50 km (31 miles) away. So, if you need anything from the supermarket, be sure to stock up while you have the chance. El Ganso was perhaps the quintessential Camino town that matched our expectations‚Äîquiet and almost deserted at times. I distinctly remember reading my book in front of the albergue and hearing the echo of a dry leaf rolling down the street, which perfectly summed up the peacefulness of that town.

Our next stop took us to El Acebo de San Miguel, which included the ascent to Foncebad√≥n, followed by the highest point on the Camino Frances‚ÄîCruz de Ferro‚Äîand then some of the descent to Molinaseca. As expected, this leg was tough. Despite the hot day, the altitude brought grey skies and a chilly mist, making it perfect for hiking. It was also the first time we had to put on more clothes due to the cold. But the views were interesting and unique the whole way. El Acebo was a charming town built entirely on a slope, and the strong winds were suggestive of its high altitude. But overall, it was a rewarding stop on our journey.

Something we didn't expect was that some of the most challenging parts of the hike for us would be the descents. Not only were they steep, but the terrain also made them even more difficult. The descent from El Acebo was one of the most challenging parts of the entire hike because the ground was covered in sharp rocks that shifted with each step. Unfortunately, this is also where my partner rolled her ankle, so be careful in this area. It took us four hours to complete the descent because of the injury. Before starting the Camino, I had pictured descents as opportunities to move quickly and make up for lost time. But in reality, they required just as much focus and effort as the ascents.

Our next stop was Camponaraya, which required us to walk through Ponferrada, a larger city rather than a town. This is the  place to stock up on supplies you've been needing. After leaving Ponferrada, we accidentally came off the trail for the first time and had to figure out how to get back on track. This was the only time that happened during our journey, so either this part wasn't well-signposted, or we simply made a mistake. It's worth mentioning that while getting turned away from a full albergue isn't a common occurrence, it happens, and it can be demoralizing after a long day of walking. We tried to stay at Fuentesnuevas (a place that doesn't even exist on Google Maps), but were turned away and had to walk at least another 5 km (3.1 miles). In the end, we managed to secure the last room at a hostel in Camponaraya. If we had arrived just half an hour later, we might have been forced to walk even further. And by that point, neither of us had the energy to cover more than 30 km (18.6 miles) per day. 

There's a lot of talk about what's ""easy"" and what's ""hard"" on the Camino, but it's important to remember that it attracts a diverse range of people. What might work for one person might not work for someone else. There's this debate about whether or not hiking boots are actually the best footwear. I chose to wear hiking boots for all 13 legs of the journey and only wished for flatter shoes during one leg (from Villafranca del Bierzo to Vega de Valcarce, due to a slanted concrete path). In a total of 311 km, I never rolled an ankle. But my partner wore HOKA sneakers without ankle support and ended up rolling her ankle. But she still stands by her choice of footwear because they were lighter and worked well for her on almost every leg (except for the descent from El Acebo). We also found that what one of us found to be the hardest leg (the second day versus the penultimate day) was completely different for individual reasons. The Camino is personal. Everyone's experience will be unique. 

Our next destination was Villafranca del Bierzo, and the views along this leg were stunning and some of our favorite on the entire hike. Villafranca del Bierzo itself was exceptionally picturesque, and we had the best men√∫ del d√≠a of our entire journey at the restaurant El Padrino. But the restaurant is very local, so so don‚Äôt count on getting a table if it‚Äôs peak time and you‚Äôre don‚Äôt have enough Spanish at your disposal. We stayed at Albergue de la Piedra, which was one of the best albergues we encountered during our trip. The owner was very kind and accommodating.

Our final stop before entering Galicia was Vega de Valcarce. This was by far the easiest and most uneventful leg of our journey, consisting mostly of concrete and roads. But Vega de Valcarce was a charming town, and we stayed at our favourite albergue of the trip, Albergue El Paso. Here, we could finally relax and unwind, and again, the owner was incredibly hospitable.

Fonfr√≠a was our next stop. To get there, we had to pass O Cebreiro, the final peak on the Camino before entering Galicia. The ascent to O Cebreiro was the most physically challenging part of our entire hike. Climbing up that winding hill, while rewarding, required a systematic and meditative approach. Reaching the top felt like a major achievement. In Fonfr√≠a, we stayed at Albergue A Reboleira, which was another fantastic albergue. 

Sarria was noticeably bigger than the towns we had passed through before and made for a good opportunity to have a larger and more expensive meal at one of its many restaurants. The walk to Sarria was tough, and while the town itself wasn't unimpressive, it didn't stand out compared to other places we had been. But if you do end up in Sarria, be sure to have breakfast there. It may be a while before you find another place to rest and eat along the way.

For us, the atmosphere of the Camino shifted in Sarria. Up until this point, it had been everything we had hoped for‚Äîpeaceful, beautiful and filled with long stretches of solitude. And when we had encountered other hikers, we exchanged friendly ""Buen Camino!"" greetings. It felt special and communal. But what we discovered in Sarria was that many people who want to say they officially completed the Camino (where the rules state that you must walk at least 100 km (62.1 miles) to have your journey recognized) start at Sarria because it marks the first point from which you can reach that minimum. There's also no requirement to carry all of your belongings in a rucksack, so some people have their bags transported to their next destination. For me, this takes away from the experience, but for others (e.g. the elderly), it may make a huge difference when walking 20 km (12.4 miles) per day.

In any case, Sarria marked a shift in the Camino's atmosphere. There were stands selling stamp pressings for ‚Ç¨5, and the sheer number of people starting their Camino in Sarria slowed down our pace. Between Sarria and Portomar√≠n, don't expect to find a quiet restaurant or caf√©. Everything is packed and chaotic. The first place we could find a seat had an overwhelming number of people, and getting served amidst the jostle and queue-cutting was challenging. Finding accommodation in towns after Sarria also proved to be a significant challenge due to the increased number of hikers. Call ahead and book a room for the night to avoid the disappointment of getting turned away from multiple albergues (as happened to us later in Palas de Rei). This change in atmosphere at Sarria caught us off guard. The Camino for us was a personal and internal journey. Some people may enjoy listening to other people's music from a Bluetooth speaker mixed with loud group conversations because it makes for a lively atmosphere. But personally, I don't enjoy that, and after Sarria, it felt impossible to escape. 

We arrived in Portomar√≠n, and thankfully, the density of people had thinned out as others veered off in different directions. We stopped at the first available place we could find. Portomar√≠n had a strange energy to it, with its bridge being the clear highlight. Seeing locals dancing on a Sunday night, however, was pretty wholesome and restored good feelings from earlier in the hike.

We left Portomar√≠n at 06:30, the first time on the trip when we needed our head torches because it was still dark. The atmosphere of walking through the forest in the early hours was fun, especially since there were now fewer people on the trail again. We reached Palas de Rei eight hours later and tried several albergues, but they were all full. One particular owner went out of their way to call other albergues in the area to see if there were any available beds, but they all reported being fully booked. They suggested trying the ""municipal"" (a public sector albergue) as a last resort. We were lucky enough to secure some of the last beds there, so we were thankful, but I did get bitten by bed bugs multiple times. 

The next day, we hiked to Boente, and it was the first time since Sarria that we felt the essence of the Camino again. Boente had a similar charm to El Ganso, being such a tiny town. We had a great night's sleep at Albergue El Aleman. I'd recommend it to other pilgrims for sure. 

The following day, we made our way to O Pedrouzo. This walk was particularly hard for me personally, perhaps because I knew the end was near. O Pedrouzo felt like a stopgap on the journey, lacking any notable features. We also had a rough experience with the albergue, which was over-crowded with too many beds shoved into one room.

The final hike to Santiago de Compostela was filled with joy and a sense of accomplishment. When we finally reached the cathedral, it dawned on us that we had completed a 311 km journey. Time seemed to slow down as we made our way through the city, fully aware that our adventure would soon come to an end. The feeling of reaching the end was incredible. 

In the end, the Camino was a challenging but overall rewarding experience. There was the physical challenge of walking 311 km across varied terrain, as well as the mental challenge of staying in shared rooms multiple nights in a row. As a light sleeper and as someone who values their personal space and cleanliness, this was the cost of the unique landscapes I had come to see. The beauty of the pilgrimage and the feeling of personal accomplishment from completing it were worth it. Walking the Camino with my partner actually brought us even closer, showing us that we could endure long periods of problem-solving together, even at times when we didn't feel like it. You can't really put a price on that.

So what I would say is: get a good idea of what the pilgrimage is like before you set off. Don't romanticise it, but don't expect it to be absolute hell either. Keep an open mind along the way and be open to change your plans on the fly. Don't expect the beauty to come from mind-blowing landmark after mind-blowing landmark. It's more subtle than that; it's in the journey itself. And the walk isn't ‚Äúeasy‚Äù or ‚Äúhard‚Äù. It's about challenging yourself in a realistic and useful way. Form expectations, keep them in check, appreciate the highs because they don't last forever and embrace the lows because you can't control them.

Here's the best advice I can offer to those thinking of doing the Camino for two weeks:

* Learn some Spanish. It'll make a huge difference on your trip. Throughout the entire Camino, only a handful of people in the service industry could speak English. The majority only spoke Spanish. Knowing even just 50‚Äì100 words will enhance your experience.
* Find a pace that works for you and stick with it, taking into account the changing elevation. There's no point trying to push yourself to walk 40 km (24.9 miles) in one day just because someone online said it was a reasonable distance. Adjust your plan based on your body's needs. 
* Bring cash. Draw out about ‚Ç¨100 at a time to mitigate the risk of theft. In the 13 days we were on the hike, we never felt unsafe, but it's better to be cautious. If you're traveling alone, be extra vigilant with your belongings.
* Start your day early, at 06:00, and aim to finish your daily hike before the peak heat of the day (usually around 15:00 or 16:00 in Northern Spain in the summer). You'll be able to walk further and more comfortably when the temperature is lower.
* Don't rely on Google Maps. The opening hours of establishments may not be accurate, and the plotted route may not always align with the actual Camino route. Keep your distances and timings flexible.
* Plan for rain even in August in Northern Spain. Bring waterproof shoes and a rain poncho to protect yourself and your belongings. 
* Bring a sleeping bag, even if you plan to stay in albergues. Some places may only provide a thin sheet or basic duvet, and others may have bed bugs. A sleeping bag will give you the best shot at a consistently comfortable night's rest. 
* Block out sound with earplugs or headphones. People from Southern Europe may be more accustomed to playing music or videos out loud in confined spaces or having loud phone conversations, which can disrupt your peace and quiet. Protect your need for solitude and rest.",2023-09-19 12:50:26+00:00,31,15

16k4p9l,sesamoid,My Sesamoid Journey Through 2.5 Years,"Cause of the injury: About 2.5 years ago I was running long distances (15k+) in too tight of a shoe. I had bought a new pair of running shoes and the right shoe was too small for my foot (especially the toe box!). I was doing my longer runs and had numbness in my right foot and toe area. This was during winter and I did not think anything of it as my toes often get quite cold. This went on for a few weeks and was the start of it all. I have usually high arches which did not help the injury. 

Over the course of 2 years I got the following:
-	x-ray that showed no fracture in the bones
-	MRI that showed inflammation in the area
-	Opinions and second opinions from orthopedic surgeons that said no to surgery 


Here is what worked and did not work: 

What did not work:
-	Anti-inflammatories
-	Cortisone injections
-	Poorly-designed orthotics 

Not sure if it impacted:
-	Toes spreaders
-	Shock wave therapy (3 sessions)


What impacted positively: 
-	Calve stretching and exercises 
-	Orthotics with a hole punched in them around the sesamoids so they never make contact with the bottom of the shoe 
-	Seeing a podiatrist! 

Shoes:
-	Crocs inside (I never had pain when wearing Crocs!)
-	Saucony triumph
-	Hokas (I bought them about a month ago and they were good for about 2 weeks then had immediate pain in them and stopped using them). 


During this two-year period, things were improving but slightly and slowly. I would say the main improvement came from the orthotics. 

Things were better and I was able to run again (10-15k) up until about one month ago and I started to get pain in the sesamoids again. I offloaded and rested but there was still quite a bit of pain in the area. It got to the point where my feet were swollen and I was no longer able to wear the shoes I normally did. Even in the new Hokas, there was quite a bit of pain. 

I was limping all day every day, and since I am a PE teacher this can be quite hard. Here is what totally changed my life.

About one week ago I went to see a podiatrist who is also trained as a physio. I went in for a consultation that ended up being 1.5 hours and it was incredible. He was so thorough and went through every aspect of the injury. Here is what he did:

-	Applied direct pressure to sesamoids and realized that I had no pain (he says usually patients with sesamoiditis have noticeable pain when pressure is applied, but I had none)
-	This led him to think there was something more going on around the foot that might be contributing and said the following:
o	Self-massage into the tarsal tunnel (in between Achilles tendon and medial malleolus (in neutral and/or stretch with foot on chair)
o	Ankle dorsiflexion lunge (knee to wall) 20-30seconds x 5-10 per day until symmetrical.
-	He provided me with foam doughnut shapes that I can add for padding around the sesamoids
-	He also took my orthotics and punched a hole in the sesamoid area 
o	I believe this had the greatest impact on my injury


I went in the evening limping into this session and in pain and I walked out pain-free and went on an hour-long walk with no pain at all that same evening. I now go back and forth between the Hokas and Sauconys. Over this past week, I have been able to walk without problems and rarely think of my injury. While I can sometimes notice slight soreness toward the end of the day, it is nothing compared the what it was and I know I am in the process of healing it. Seeing a podiatrist who could look through a physio lens totally changed everything and is the reason I can walk now without pain.

I do not normally post on reddit, but this community has been so helpful to me and I wanted to share. This injury has caused a lot of mental drain, so I am glad I can see and feel improvements.",2023-09-16 11:04:13+00:00,20,8

16glqbk,Shoes,Best shoes for standing all day,"Hi friends! I‚Äôm going to start working as a barista and I have some money put aside to buy new shoes. I see such mixed opinions on this topic so I‚Äôd like to hear what you guys have to say. What shoes are best for standing and doing a little bit of walking back and forth all day?

I‚Äôve noticed if I wear my old Nike running shoes, my ankles and the back of my calves feel like they need to be stretched/massaged at the end of the day. This might be because they are old or worn out, or it is because I‚Äôm not using them for running. And yet all the shoes recommended when you google good shoes for standing, are running shoes??

In my mind surely something with less padding and no drop is what would be healthy for your legs? But I don‚Äôt really know enough to confirm that.

Barefoot shoes? I don‚Äôt get why they‚Äôre so expensive though if they‚Äôre just a thin flat shoe with no padding. I have thin flat NB shoes with no padding and they‚Äôre nice but they‚Äôre a bit old and falling apart, and they‚Äôre nothing special in terms of comfort.

So, thoughts? New balance shoes with no drop? Hoka shoes with excessive padding and a bigger drop? Adidas ultraboost 1.0, which is somewhere in the middle? Vivo Barefoot shoes, which seem way overpriced for what they are?

I‚Äôm in South Africa and my budget can fit most of the higher end shoes but eg if one of the cheaper New Balances is the best option, it would be nice to save some money üê•",2023-09-12 08:30:06+00:00,1,8

16g4txz,bunions,6 Week Post Op MIS/Arthrex Surgery,"It's been a long 6 weeks but it's here and I'm finally slowly weight bearing once again! Doctor says I'm healing nicely but it was obvious I didn't move manually move my big toe like I should have. I admit I was squeamish and put it off. Now I have a script for PT and I have to really commit to it several times a day. Don't be me! 

I switched out of my post op shoe and tried my left Hoka. My feel are too swollen so I brought an Oofos slide as a back up. I'm glad I brought my cane because I feel unstable, although most of that I believe is mental. Definitely feeling like I'm learning to rewalk. 

Since the last time I updated here- week 2-6 has been a roller coaster. There were days I thought I'd never feel better and in the past couple of days I finally saw the light at the end of the tunnel. My mental fog lifted around week 3.5 and I was able to go back to reading and cross stitching. In the past week I've really been able to reduce the amount of time I need to lay down with ice, although I still elevate at night and plan to for awhile. I took a stumble at week 4 and I was terrified I did damage. Today I could finally breathe a sigh of relief when my X-rays came up clear. 

My goal has been making it to a football game several states away at the end of the month. My doctor cleared me to fly but advised me to stay on low dose aspirin leading up to and one week after my trip. 

Some things that have been a huge help-

1) Cane if you're heel bearing. I bought this on my own on Amazon. It helps with balance and I could lean on it to put my foot up off the ground for a minute. 

2) Bregg Active Ice Machine is still hands down the best thing I've bought for this recovery. 

3) Someone recommended tubular ace bandages. It was great to have light compression while providing a buffer between my foot and my shoe. 

4) Elevated double leg pillows- I bought an extra one so I could have one in the living room and one in the bedroom. No regrets buying the second. 

I hope this helps someone! I'm feeling like we're almost there to get back doing the things I love.",2023-09-11 19:34:29+00:00,7,7

Hi everyone,

I'm going to be traveling for two and a half weeks, in which case I'll be walking all day everyday. I'm looking for a sneaker that can support \~20k steps for 18 days and give me the best chances of not killing my feet and knees. I realize that the best options will be something orthopedic and made specifically for walking/running, but I'm really trying to find something that isn't completely ugly haha. My preferred style is something white and sleek, however I can rock something a little more stylized as well. Here's some options I've found:

STYLE OVER COMFORT:

[Asics X89](https://www.asics.com/us/en-us/ex89/p/ANA_1201A476-115.html?width=Standard)\--I know Asics are reliable but not sure how great this particular style would be

[Asics Japan S](https://www.asics.com/us/en-us/japan-s/p/ANA_1202A410-100.html)\--Same as above

[Asics Japan S ST](https://www.asics.com/us/en-us/japan-s-st/p/ANA_1203A289-105.html)\--Same, platforms might be a bad idea

COMFORT OVER STYLE:

[On Cloud The Roger Advantage](https://www.on-running.com/en-us/products/the-roger-advantage-48adv/womens/white-dustrose-shoes-48.99147)\--I feel like these can compete style-wise, would love to hear if anyone has these

[On Cloud The Roger Spin](https://www.on-running.com/en-us/products/the-roger-spin-3md1147/womens/undyed-white-yellow-shoes-3WD11481090)\--Struggling to find a real difference between these and the Advantages

[Hokas](https://www.hoka.com/en/us/womens-lifestyle/transport/1123154.html)\--by far the ugliest but can't beat the comfort/support

Would appreciate any feedback on these particular pairs, or if you've done a similar trip I'd love to hear what shoes you wore! And of course, if you have any other suggestions, I'd be grateful to hear those as well. Thank you!!",2023-09-10 04:11:06+00:00,2,11

16au3rq,Shoes,"Health care worker, standing 12+ hours a day","Hello fellow shoe enthusiasts! I have a question about a few different brands of shoes. First I would like to say that I work in Healthcare and I stand the entire time I am working. I work in surgery so other than between cases there is not a lot of walking and the absolute only time I sit during the day is my drive to/from work and during my 30 minute lunch period. 

With all of that being said I want to know some opinions in regards to shoes that I have tried and shoes that I have not tried but have heard good things about. What shoes would you absolutely üíØ suggest.

Shoes I have tried are as follows:

1. On cloud (original) loved them but they seem to loose their luster fairly quick.

2. Hoka (Cavu) hated these shoes, the arch somehow fell where my heel is? And I have normal feet/arches

3. Merrell (mocs) loved them once I broke them in at around 3 months, downside is they are leather/suede. Found a pair that was not either material but they are also not as supportive or comfortable as original.

4. Merrell (nova ((the guy version) )& antora 2((female)) the novas are super comfy...but I bought a limited edition pair and do not want to ruin them in the OR, plus they do not breathe as much as I would like. The antora 2 were comfortable at first, but then the insole started to come loose and slide to the heel. That made everything terribly uncomfortable.

5. On cloud (cloud x shift) these are breathable, but stiff and do not speed lace.

Shoes I'm curious about:

1. Brooks (suggestions on most comfortable style) 
2. KURU


I'm just looking to see everyone's opinion about the best shoes for the circumstances laid out. I'm open to any suggestions regardless of the brand.

I‚Äôm overpronating quite significantly and I‚Äôve had issues with my Achilles tendon multiple times as I increased weekly mileage, even though I run longer runs in stability shoes (lately a lot of Kayano 28/ now 30). I‚Äôve now got individualized insoles that help with that (long-term I‚Äòm not a fan of insoles, but they do help for now, at least on the 20k+ runs on tiring legs). I‚Äòm currently searching for the best fit for my Berlin marathon, which should not be a severe injury risk, but still be as light and fast as possible. 

Thanks to the support from the insole, I believe I can go for a subtle support shoe - the latest generation of stability shoes without a turbo-hard support block on the inside (e.g. see changes in the Kayano 30). 

Based on my review research thus far, I‚Äôve got a couple of options on my list: 
- Saucony Tempus 
- Puma ForeverRun Nitro
- Hoka Arahi 6

The safe (healthy) bet would be to use my new Kayano 30, which offer a nice supported ride, however as you know it‚Äôs not really a speedy shoe. Still, I feel comfortable in it while running my anticipated race pace (~5:20/km).

15xrin6,hiking,Hoka Challenger ATR 7 Issues,"Previously owned two pair of the Challenger ATR 6s (gore-tex) in late 2022 early 2023. Used primarily for hiking on the AT, mostly PA, NJ and NY. Anyway, both pair of 6s were fantastic and I got 400-500 miles out of each. Fast forward to the the 7s. Recently got a pair for some AT hiking. Did 30 miles in VA and another 40 in PA, and noticed that the glue was giving out and the bottoms were peeling off.

I took them back to my local running store and they said it looked like a manufacturing issue, and they sent them back to Hoka, replaced free of charge.

Broke my new pair in around town (12 miles or so), and took them out on the AT on Sunday. Got 22 miles in over your typical PA rocks, got home, inspected them, and exact same thing.

The store that I use said they‚Äôd swap them and suggested that I look for a different shoe. Has anyone had similar experiences with the Hoka Challenger ATR 7s? Thinking about trying out Speedgoats instead, as I read they‚Äôre more for rugged terrain, which is what I‚Äôm primarily hiking on. 

Looking for feedback or suggestions.

I stretch before my runs and use a foam roller to roll out my calves but it hasn‚Äôt been helping much. The pain is now also on the front sides of my lower legs like my shins and soleus muscle. I don‚Äôt have pain anywhere else when I run. Does anyone have advice on how to fix this?

15utc00,AskDocs,Plantars Fasciitis with No Direction,"On Sunday, I (27F but they/them pronouns) walked my dog a few miles in shoes that were too worn down. The next day, my right heel hurt so bad that I couldn't walk. I called into work (I am a retail manager) and went to urgent care, as I was worried about a stress fracture.

ETA: 
Weight: 270 lbs
 Height: 5'10""
Location: Iowa, USA
Duration of issue: my feet have been hurting after work for the past 3 months, and I've needed new shoes about for about that long but haven't had the money. Monday was the first morning that I've woken up and the foot pain hadn't gone away.

They did x rays and the nurse practitioner didn't see any fractures. She gave me a boot and said ""I'm still going to have the radiologist look just in case I missed something. If you have a fracture and I didn't give you a boot they'd kill me."" 

I asked her some questions about what I was supposed to do, and she was very vague on answers. She just said the radiologist would call after they looked at my x rays, and she gave me some stretches to do. She said it was Plantar's Fasciitis.

The radiologist called on Tuesday and said no fractures, but there were some small heel spurs. They were referring me to a podiatrist and someone would call me. No one has called me yet.

My question is: how do I proceed in the meantime? Do I wear the boot even though I don't have a fracture? I've been doing my exercises. Would massaging help or potentially make the issue worse? Should I be staying off it as much as possible or staying active? Pain has substantially subsided, but it still hurts to stand for more than a few minutes or walk for very long. I also upgraded to a nice pair of Hoka shoes.

Please let me know if there's any important info I missed. I've known people that have had lots of problems stem from plantains fasciitis and I want to minimize damage as much as possible.

Thank you!",2023-08-18 19:07:38+00:00,1,2
15unsre,PlantarFasciitis,I can‚Äôt take it anymore! I MUST have cute shoes!!,"I love shoes. I always have.

But it‚Äôs still not good enough. I really, really want some booties or knee-high boots. And the dr scholls aren‚Äôt as good on my feet, even tho I use the insoles my podiatrist recommended. I can only wear them for short periods.

I can‚Äôt afford to pay $100+ for a pair of shoes right now. It‚Äôs hard enough to replace my hokas. Even just spending $50 is *really* pushing my budget limit.

I‚Äôm just getting desperate for some advice or at least stories of others‚Äô experiences. Huge thank you to anyone who takes the time to read my situation and chime in! My mental health is really declining from being in so much consistent pain.

Okay so:

I have been suffering heel pain in my left foot for almost a year now. Xray shows two tiny heel spurs. I‚Äôve been to two different podiatrists because I had to change insurance. Anyways I last saw the current podiatrist in early April. He told me to buy 
wider shoes, wear a night split and stretch way more often. So I immediately started upping my stretching game for the next three months. Meanwhile my back has been hurting/getting worse and I find out I have spinal stenosis, arthritis and pinched nerves. So I Do physical therapy for over two months and almost all the stretches continue to hurt my back especially hamstring stretch. So when my referral expired for physical therapy I try laying off the hamstring and calf stretches‚Ä¶ back pain starts getting better almost immediately!
But now my flippin heel pain is getting worse again. I tried doing the heel drop stretch on a stair to loosen it up one day but then I only got about 50 feet before feeling intense pinching/stabbing in my lower back.

Soo here I am now. I‚Äôm scared not to stretch because my podiatrist emphasized that‚Äôs the way to heal my pf. But I‚Äôm scared to stretch because it‚Äôs keeping my lower back from healing. 

Has anyone else experienced anything similar? Are there ways to stretch my calves without tugging on my hamstrings?  I‚Äôm wearing Hoka Bondis but maybe I also need custom orthotics? Im seeing the podiatrist again this week and I am really nervous he won‚Äôt figure in my back pain or say I should just keep stretching.",2023-08-18 07:54:10+00:00,6,16

Things begin to wind down now from at least the long run duration as my next Sunday will only be 2:15 mins. 

I covered 25 and change with my 60 mins of easier pace paired with the intervals.  

Lots of my faster work has been done in new balance rebels v3 and Hoka mach x has 200 miles of speed work and long runs on them.  Did a lot of earlier work in some glycerins and ASICS cumulus as well as some easy runs in my old favorites the speedgoats 4.

I am extremely excited to start my 8 day Camino on this Monday. I will be doing the French section between Villafranca del Bierzo and Santiago.

The issue is that I stupidly played soccer without any shoes two days ago, and a blister has come up in my big toe. It does not hurt a lot, but I can feel it (particularly when I walk barefooted). The blister is still closed (i.e. has not popped). Any tips on how to manage it  would you pop it or would you expect it to recover alone by Monday?

Also, regarding shoeware, I was planning on using my running Hoka One One Clifton 8 shoes. They fit we very nicely and feel extremely comfy, but I have read online that trial shoes might be more suitable for the Camino.

15n1z1a,sesamoid,Sesamoidectomy experience - post 2 - treatment options,"Sesamoid and ball of foot pain. What you can do about it, my experience, and what the experts may recommend.

See a podiatrist -¬†This may sound obvious but I didn't have much experience with the medical industry so I wasn't sure who to see first. My first appointment was with a Physio but I would recommend instead a Podiatrist because they specialise in foot biomechanics.

Custom orthotics - expensive I know but this is probably the most important thing you can do. You need to offload the area of pain and support your arch. I have had some terrible orthotics made that are simply unwearable as they make the pain worse, keep going back to your podiatrist (or find a new one) until it's perfect for you.

Hoka shoes - the rocker sole, wide toe box and cushioning reduces load in your forefoot. Any shoes with a high heel is out.

Icing - freeze a bottle of water, place a tea towel over it and use it to roll under your foot. Your pain may be due to inflammation so you need to settle this down as soon after feeling pain as possible. My mistake was probably not doing this in the first week following the onset of pain.

Tape foot - the podiatrist may tape your foot in a variety of ways. I found Spica taping to be helpful. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4cHoZ1KDDQ&t=124s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4cHoZ1KDDQ&t=124s)

Dancer‚Äôs pad - you can buy these but i would recommend buying some Leuko foam and cutting it to try different ways to alleviate the pressure on your ball of foot. Especially if you don't have custom orthotics. This way you can customise it and see what works for you. Try padding your insole over your 4 smaller toes and their metatarsal joints and leave the big toe and joint floating. Or, try making a dome and place this in the middle of your insole - called a metatarsal dome. Make sure you have adequate arch support.

Carbon fibre insoles - i didn't try these but theory is the same as Spica taping which limits the bend of your 1st MTP joint.

Strengthening - a million different exercises you can try. ask your podiatrist but be wary not to do ones that place extra pressure on your ball of foot, specifically 1st MTP joint (big toe joint).

Stretching - I was never sure whether to stretch, strengthen or rest. It felt good for me so i regularly stretched and foam rolled my foot and calf. I think rest in the first few days is important but you need to get moving again to preserve muscle strength.

Ibuprofen gel - did nothing for me

NSAID - did nothing other than upset my stomach

Tiger balm - helped a little when it's really sore

Massage with physio cream - always helps a little in the short term

Stay off hard floors

Shed body weight to reduce pressure

&#x200B;

If the pain persists and you decide to see a doctor, probably an orthopaedic specialist, make sure they are a foot specialist and ask for an MRI. These are small bones and the x-ray is often insufficient. I didn't know this, but there are sports doctors too so it may be worthwhile seeing them if it's a sports related injury. I would also insist on scans of your other foot to compare what's different. I never had this done and was never offered this, but i regret it. On this journey, what you need to learn is that you need to advocate for what you want yourself. Do your research, ask questions, be informed, and don't be afraid to push for what you want. Mentally you need to be prepared for the fact that most medical practitioners won't check up on you. Don't expect a call from your podiatrist asking how the new orthotics are going. It's difficult to swallow, but in my experience unless you pay the consult fee, there is no follow up. It sucks but just be prepared for that mentally, lean on your family and friends instead for support.

&#x200B;

Here are some more experimental therapies that I came across. I have not tried them all but I think it's worth a go if it helps you avoid surgery.

Bone stimulation

Shockwave therapy

Platelet rich injections

Cortisone injections - helped for 4 weeks then pain returned. Apparently repeated use is not recommended.

Acupuncture -¬† did not help me

Wear a boot - I did this for 4 weeks as a last resort prior to surgery. I was told it's an inflammation issue so it made sense to totally offload it however I think it actually made things worse because the joint is not moving and your foot muscles deteriorate. Not recommended.

ESWT - heard good things about this

Laser therapy

&#x200B;

Despite all this, if you are thinking in terms of surgery, rather than excise the bone, think of ways you can preserve the joint. I have come across examples of bone grafting which have been successful, albeit in small patient sample numbers.

Give it time, be patient and I hope something in this list helps you. Feel free to suggest others and I will add it to the list.",2023-08-10 04:28:05+00:00,11,1

(No feet pics, it's just a diagram). The rest of the day it was a sharp pain but on Monday I couldn't put weight fully on my left foot. I could tip toe around without pain. My left foot has gradually gotten better but on Tuesday my right foot started bothering me and the scale has been tipping so today my left foot feels pretty good and my right hurts more. My dad says it's plantar fasciitis, which he used to have, but there are some conflicting symptoms:

It felt best, and today doesn't hurt, when I walk barefoot. Everything from hokas, skechers, slides, muck boots, all hurt more than walking barefoot. 

It doesn't hurt to stretch my arch. I tried the plantar fasciitis toe stretch, calf raises on a step, sitting on my heels. None of them hurt or feel like they're activating the painful part of my foot.

I can walk around on my toes/balls of my feet or my heels without pain. It's only when I put weight on the whole of my feet that it hurts.

Could this be plantar fasciitis? Should I see a podiatrist? I prefer the ostrich method, ignoring something until it goes away, but I want to get back to running, horseback riding, and walking my dog with shoes on, because right now the neighbors think I'm crazy.",2023-08-03 18:21:39+00:00,1,3
15ghbxs,bunions,What qualifies as too much pain?,"Debating surgery and the main questions seem to be - are you in enough pain or are you in pain every day. I struggle a little to answer this and I was wondering if anyone had advice. I use what I would call heavy duty custom orthotics - we've gone for a very rigid/stable heel with high heel walls, a padded arch, a dropped big toe, and a metatarsal pad. I wear these in Hoka Bondi's or occasionally another very supportive/rigid rocker running shoe. I always wear birkenstock slippers in the house and can't really walk without them. My foot basically never touches the ground without support. I get some pain in the joint but the most pain between my first and second metatarsal from the spread, and I counteract this a bit with compressive sleeves for plantar fasciitis, the infracare bunion aligner and a small toe spacer. If things are going well I have limited pain, mostly just once I've gotten in bed at night. Occasionally I have flare-ups. Three days ago I was in a tennis shoe (with my orthotics in) - I can use these shoes for short times when I am for example going to a restaurant and won't really be walking - and I ended up having to walk way more than I planned. Cue tons of pain. I know that if I wasn't taking all the precautions that I do I wouldn't really be able to walk, which would certainly pass the surgery threshold, but at the same time I can keep my feet relatively okay with all these things. Any tips on whether I keep going as is or just get them done? Left is moderate, right is mild/moderate but I naturally have some splay which makes them more painful than you'd expect. I'm 25 female and have had them since childhood, starting to wear orthotics maybe around age 12. I would definitely want a permanent fix so I've been looking at lapiplasty.

15ddz4a,AskDocs,"[28M] ""Supportive"" shoe for foot pain","I‚Äôm having a slight injury with the top/front/outside of my left foot where the soft tissue is a bit sore. MRI confirmed it‚Äôs not a stress fracture, also different parts of the foot are sore on different days. The original injury probably happened because of me having to walk differently during recovery from an ankle injury, and I recently re-injured it by doing too much hiking/walking too quickly in transitioning to barefoot shoes.   

I usually walk around barefoot at home and wear leather camp mocs/loafers out and about, but the doctor recommended I wear a ‚Äúsupportive‚Äù shoe at home during this time (and to stop the hiking/walking in barefoot shoes, and to re-up my foot/ankle PT from before). Also to note, I have pretty flat, wide feet (but I haven‚Äôt really had issues with it ever in my life, especially when walking indoors barefoot). He listed some brands of shoes I could try (Asics, Brooks, Hoka, Birkenstocks) and I didn‚Äôt have too much time to ask questions (will ask in a followup visit in a few weeks).   

I thought about this later and I kind of don‚Äôt even understand the meaning of ‚Äúsupportive shoe‚Äù and how all the shoes he listed could all be ‚Äúsupportive‚Äù and ‚Äúright‚Äù for my recovery. It sounds pretty of dumb because it‚Äôs a pretty common descriptor for a shoe, but the more I thought about it the more I don‚Äôt understand what the term ACTUALLY means, or at least it‚Äôs helpfulness/relevance.  

I understand what a ‚Äúcushioned shoe‚Äù is and the point of it, the material is softer and you sink into it more than a hard surface, so it‚Äôs not so hard when you step on it. Basically cushion is the amount of ‚Äúgive‚Äù the material has, and if you have a ‚Äúhard‚Äù surface, putting cushion on it makes it ‚Äúsofter.‚Äù   

But what I don‚Äôt get is how a hard shoe like a Birkenstock can be supportive just like a Hoka with a huge cushioned sole. How can both be the right type of support to recovery from an injury? Like the Birkenstock would probably be harder and stiffer than walking barefoot on a carpeted floor (less cushion) and the Hoka would be have more cushion. I don‚Äôt get how being more cushioned and less cushioned could both count as good ‚Äúsupport.‚Äù    


One idea would be that the shoe is literally supposed to ‚Äúsupport‚Äù your arches (from below) . Ok, but everyone‚Äôs arches are not the same, and different shoes themselves obviously have different arch supports, is the fact of having ANY arch support just supposed to be automatically better for your foot to recover? We wouldn‚Äôt say if you need glasses to see clearer you should just get ‚Äúany‚Äù pair of glasses and that would be better than having no glasses, you need a correct prescription that‚Äôs tailored for you. But again the doctor just recommended ‚Äúsupportive‚Äù shoes and gave examples that spanned a seemingly wide range. Especially for flat feet like mine, having arch support doesn‚Äôt even seem like it‚Äôs necessary or helpful.   





It almost makes it seem like ‚Äúany‚Äù shoe can provide ‚Äúsupport‚Äù vs just being barefoot, which makes it seem like the term is useless and irrelevant. As a thought experiment, what if you just made a shoe whose sole has the exact same feel/properties as the ground you were walking on? Would the fact that it‚Äôs strapped to your feet make it automatically ‚Äúsupportive?‚Äù 





Hoping someone can give me an explanation of either what ‚Äúsupportive‚Äù means or how a ‚Äúsupportive‚Äù shoe",2023-07-30 06:07:54+00:00,1,1

14z1sam,Serverlife,Server shoes,"Hey y'all I've been working in the industry for about two years and I still have yet to find good, comfy, long lasting shoes. 

So far, my favorite ones have surprisingly been the crocs pro literide bistro clog HOWEVER they wear out relatively fast (around 4-6 months) and once they do start wearing out, the pain that comes to the knees and feet is pretty bad. It also has terrible arch support (read: none). 

I went on to invest a bit more and got the Hoka non slips (I believe the name of the model is bondi SR) and man they were not worth the money to me. Way too soft, arch support was too high but now that they're worn out (only took 3 months) the only comfy part of the shoe is the arch. They make my legs hurt like crazy. 

I'm currently trying out Mise footwear's new shoe (""The Standard""), I took them out to wear errands and noticed that the opening of the shoe around the front sides of the ankle was pretty tight, but they were comfy enough. Fast forward to a day later, I took them out to work, a relatively short shift (6hours) and maaaaan my feet were hurting. Legs did not hurt but as I'm typing this I'm still dealing with some lower back pain that came from wearing them to work. I'm going to return them, these shoes are supposed to have little to no break-in time so the fact that they are making me feel like this is.... ??

I've read countless recommendations on what shoes to get. Last night a server with like 20 years of experience told me to look into SAS so I'll be purchasing them next. 

I'm posting this just in case my experience with these shoes might help someone else make a decision.",2023-07-14 00:50:45+00:00,5,5
14xczlt,sesamoid,Advice Roundup!,"Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been managing my necrosed medial sesamoid, and my preparations for surgery. A big thanks to people in this reddit for helping me make positive changes and feel more in control of my life. Please let me know if you have any other suggestions/feedback!

My medical situation: The medial sesamoid has died and fragmented. An MRI and CT to investigate bone health were conclusive that the bone is entirely necrosed, and has no chance of regenerating. Before the scan results I was committed to trying conservative measures, as early stage necrosis can be reversed. The shape of the sesamoid shows that the fragmentation was the result of gradual osteonecrosis, not from an impact fracture. I'm healthy in every other way, not diabetic, a non smoker, a non drinker and don‚Äôt have osteoporosis, this issue is so far considered idiopathic. It took 8 months to discover this issue.

**Life Changes**

* I was highly active before my sesamoid issues started, and not being able to walk more than 10 minutes at a time was very distressing. This wouldn‚Äôt be necessary/possible for everyone, but after finally getting a diagnosis, I took a break from work. I needed the time and mental space to get my life back onto a positive track, and was lucky to be in a job that allowed me save for a few months off.
* I made a summary of my condition, and sent it out to all my closest friends, to let them know what was going on for me, and asked if they would like to join a whatsapp chat. The chat is a place for me to easily ask if people are free to hang out when I‚Äôm feeling down. I like that it doesn‚Äôt put pressure on one person, and also resolves the awkwardness of waiting to hear back from multiple friends, then multiple saying they‚Äôre free and having to choose who to hang out with.
* My parents made me a whole bunch of frozen meals, to help me start eating regularly again. I also started getting into a habit of ordering groceries online. I relaxed my rules around eating ethically in favor of just eating.
* I read every post about sesamoids on [https://www.drblakeshealingsole.com/](https://www.drblakeshealingsole.com/) in order to learn about conservative treatment options, and a whole bunch of medical case studies about the sesamoidectomies, plus heaps of this reddit.
* While the inflammation was at its worse and before I knew how to reduce it, I covered my bedroom floor in foam mattresses and camping mats, so I could avoid walking by crawling. Before this change I had been struggling with keeping my room tidy, which felt overwhelming.
* I got the doctor to sign off a mobility parking permit
* I set up chairs all around the house to minimize the need to walk and stand. I got all of these pretty cheap second hand, e.g an office chair in the kitchen, a barstool in front of the bathroom sink, a shower chair in the shower.
* I started doing twice daily contrast bathing as recommended by Dr Blake: [https://www.drblakeshealingsole.com/2016/01/swelling-contrast-bathing-to-reduce.html](https://www.drblakeshealingsole.com/2016/01/swelling-contrast-bathing-to-reduce.html), and doing foot yoga [https://www.reddit.com/r/sesamoid/comments/14bgqwu/singing\_praises\_of\_physical\_therapy\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sesamoid/comments/14bgqwu/singing_praises_of_physical_therapy_with/) . For me, this amazingly reduced the swelling, I was able to bend my toe for the first time in months. It took a surprising amount of logistics to get the bathing set up working, but once it was in motion, it‚Äôs become an easy morning and night time habit.
* I finally started exercising again. There are actually a lot of options for non weight bearing exercise, but I was previously too overwhelmed to begin researching. It turns out biking is totally doable if you put the pedal on your midfoot/heel. It was incredible to have the ability to explore the world again and be in the outdoors. I also got back into calisthenics that involve upper body and abs. There are lots of non weight bearing exercise routines on youtube, this one by Caroline Jordan was cheesy but actually pretty inspiring [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrLMAjZ1oZg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrLMAjZ1oZg)

* A sole you can clip underneath the shoe of your good foot to be on the same level with it as the surgical shoe
* A 3 tier trolley
* A shower chair
* Digital thermometers for measuring contrast bathing temperatures
* Heaps of ice trays to have ice on hand for contrast bathing
* I‚Äôve heard it can be painful and difficult to have to de-elevate your foot in order to travel to the bathroom in the early days after surgery, so thought I‚Äôd try out buying a female specific contraption to pee into!

**Surgery prep**

Thanks to people in here sharing their experiences, I understand how intensive post surgery recovery is, so I‚Äôm going to go live with my parents for the first few weeks after.

* ask for anti nausea medication before the operation
* set an alarm to preemptively take painkillers in the middle of the night, so you don‚Äôt wake up in pain
* try get a couple of weeks off work if possible
* expect a long, slow, at times painful recovery that will take many months. Knowing this has helped me have realistic expectations and not make plans to go traveling straight after, thinking I‚Äôd have a healed foot! I‚Äôve also taken a much lower stress job with less hours.
* Set up your room/living space beforehand to prepare it for your limited mobility, put things within arms reach of bed, have snacks on hand.
* Have a ‚Äúdry‚Äù bathing setup e.g with baby wipes ready in case it‚Äôs too painful to shower for the first few days

14t9f0o,AskDocs,Pain my right foot that's not going away. At what point do I see a doctor?,"46M

6'3, 250lbs, white

For nearly six weeks now I've been experiencing a low level but consistent set of aches in my right foot  that don't seem to be going away on their own. 

The primary source of it right behind the second and third smallest toes and seems to be right in the middle of my foot in terms of top to bottom. It feels like something needs to be massages back into place, but as far as I can tell everything is where it should be. 

There's also pain that radiates along the outside edge of this foot and right under the arch on the inside. 

There seems to be a 'cascade effect' going up my whole leg to my hip too. 

I've had plantar fasciitis in this foot before but strangely, this pain is different. The PF was always in my heel and center of my arch. That pain is still there and follows the classic PF pattern of being more intense in the morning and dissipating through out the day, but since this new pain has emerged, the PF pain has been much less intense.  

No visible bruising or swelling. I massage my foot and do stretches every day. I roll it on those little balls. I got new shoes that are supposed to be very supportive and good for foot pain (Hokas) but nothing seems to be working. 

The pain isn't very intense and doesn't inhibit me from walking, but definitely would make it hard to run. It's also present 24/7. It's decreased by MAYBE 10% in the last six weeks, which is what has me worried. Sometimes there will be a mild sensation of tingling or my foot falling asleep, but not intense. 

I can't think of anything in particular that would have caused it other than perhaps putting weight on it weird while sitting. I do tend to twist my foot behind my chair sometimes. 

I just so happened to have a check up right when the pain started and my doctor just told me to do stretches and watch my posture. But since it's not getting better, at what point do I go see a doctor about this? How do I advocate for myself so I'm not just sent away with another recommendation of stretches?

* 34 y/o female
* BMI is healthy
* Somewhat but not super athletic
* Main exercise comes from gardening, hiking, rowing, and strength training (nothing high impact)

**Symptoms and observations:**

* Pain in 2nd toe joint and ball of feet
* Prone to oversupination
* Slightly high arches
* Hypermobility in 1st toe joint, low mobility in 2nd toe joint, big toe pointing slightly up
* Calves don‚Äôt seem tight. Historically have had body workers mention tight quads and glutes more so than calves.
* History of hip pain and TMJ issues
* Tibialis anterior tendon won‚Äôt relax while standing like a normal person‚Äôs would (Dr. said to relax, but I thought I was relaxed!)
* Bunion on outside of foot is a sign of what is going on on the other side of the foot

**Family history:**

* Mother had plantar fascitis and hammer toe

**X-ray results:**

* Signs of arthritis
* First metatarsal bone is angled up too much

**Diagnosis:**

* Hallux rigidus, metatarsalgia, and arthritis in one of my big toe‚Äôs joints (the MTP)
* Apparently I have biomechanical issues from early in life that have caused cumulative damage to this joint. Root cause unclear.

Until now, I have worn minimalist shoes outside (Xero) and been barefoot inside. Given this diagnosis, my podiatrist says that's the worst thing I could do. They recommend wearing shoes all day and the shoes must be rigid and include padding, in the front of the shoe. Specific shoe recommendations include shoes Hokas, some New Balance, and some Brooks. All of these shoes include a heal lift and most do not note having a wide toe box.

Given my foot issues and pain history, what degree of heel drop makes sense? My understanding is a zero heel drop would reduce weight bearing on the ball of my foot where there is pain/arthritis and minimize weight-bearing transfer up-the-chain to knees and hips. However, I don‚Äôt understand why the shoe list from the podiatrist doesnt include any zero drop options. Is there some interaction between padding/shoe rigidity/and heel rise that I‚Äôm missing? Is heel drop useful in some way?

I noticed Altras, which seem to have rigidity and padding, but also a wide toe box and zero drop.",2023-06-29 02:52:35+00:00,10,2
14lchqx,FootFunction,Advice - cartilage and sesamoid injury 10 months ago getting worse - is conservative treatment still enough?,"Hey all! I am losing my mind over this big toe injury from September last year! It‚Äôs just getting worse and podiatrist thinks conservative treatment is still going to fix it, but it‚Äôs now getting more painful by the day. Have to wait another 2 months still to see an orthopaedic surgeon for their opinion but I just want to know if it will ever heal. I have orthotics & extra adjustments and wear with Hokas everyday, wore a Darco shoe to immobilise for 2+ months, and always have it strapped now. Original ultrasound/xray then later ultrasound/CT scan found bursitis only, but recent MRI found cartilage fracture (1st pic) and ‚Äòmild‚Äô sesamoiditis (whatever is going on in other 2 pics). If anyone wants to give their opinion on the sesamoid situation in the MRI please do - is the plantar plate torn or stress fracture in sesamoid? Sesamoiditis is such a vague diagnosis. 
Does anyone have experience with any similar situation and do you think it will just slowly heal over time?
I am a lifelong dancer and getting pretty down and losing hope these days :(
Thanks and big love and gratitude for any advice :)",2023-06-28 15:26:39+00:00,2,27

14iig8r,hiking,GORE TEX Trail Shoe Popularity Has Gotten Out Of Control,"Many people including myself have really benefited from the wave of trail running / sneaker hiking type shoes that have hit the market in recent years. It is a massive change and a big improvement on old style hiking boots for most journeys. 

Every brand in this category sells so many Gore Tex shoes. Some recent releases are even Gore Tex only e.g. Hoka Trail Code. However as far as I have seen, anyone with any experience would tell you to avoid Gore Tex in shoes. It is like wearing a plastic bag and the upside of waterproofing is outweighed by the downsides. Some say it is worth it when you expect snow, but that seems to be the only credible use case. Even then there is room for debate.

So why, given opinion seems to be so set against using Gore Tex in shoes, is every trail / approach shoe sold with it? Is the broader market just completely misinformed? Do shoe companies not care if they sell the right product as long as it sells? Or am I just coming from an anti Gore Tex shoe echo chamber and actually I am wrong and people love them?",2023-06-25 10:00:44+00:00,8,34

14ehj8a,AskDocs,Lower back pain only after walking,"Hello, I'm (33F) wondering if anyone has any advice for me please: About three weeks ago I believe I messed up my back on the lower left side as I did an exercise (donkey kicks) with a very heavy band (for me). It was two days after that when my back was so sore and stiff in that area. I had the most trouble sitting and had to lay down and walk and repeat to get some relief. I've never threw out/hurt my back like this before. However after one week everything started improving and its been three weeks now and that pain and stiffness is gone. 

Ive been a consistenly active person over the last 3 years as background. I've played rec volleyball recently, and played tennis for about 25 mins a couple days ago. I've also done a couple zumba classes and a strength training class. I say this because I have not had any pain from those activities, but when I walk for more than 10 minutes, I get this stabbing awful pain in my lower left of my back. It feels like a knife is stabbing my bone? Right above my butt cheek. I've had a ""lighter"" version of this pain before from walking, but it's been worse lately.

I used to have foot pain a few years ago, so I got really supportive  shoes (Hoka) and ever since have not had foot pain. Now though, it seems that pain has ""moved"" to my lower back. It was just 3 days ago, I walked around downtown for about 15 minutes and that pain came on. The pain subsides once I'm off my feet for a while. 

Do you think it could be I just need proper orthotics? Or could it be more serious? Obviously not expecting miracle answers but thought I'd ask for any info someone might provide. 

Thanks!

Migraines, IBS-D, Labile Hypertension

Foot pain - outside of left foot and top of left foot. The pain on the outside of the foot can be even be when not moving, resting in bed the weight of the blanket can hurt. Both feet and ankles hurt when descending stairs. I am fine when I'm up walking around all day it's just getting up after resting it first hurts. I went to the podiatrist (foot and ankle) who took x-rays, gave me 2 kinds of braces and said I need to buy better shoes either New Balance, Hoka, Vionics, or Brooks brands. Also, made me get custom orthotics I have yet to use them because I need to get the shoes first. The doctor talked in a lot of medical terms and it was so much all at once I don't remember what was wrong. Something about arches, something about toes and also asked me if the toes hurt because there is some kind of white near the knuckle spaces said a little while was ok but I had a lot. I have gained at least 25 lbs since I went off my Topamax - but it's hard to exercise when you're in pain. The only definite thing I remember was that my Achilles tendons are too tight so I was given the braces and 3 exercises to do. I'm in so much pain I'm not wearing the braces. The doctor offered to give me an injection but that day I wasn't in the mood to get a shot - when I go back I will definitely ask for one. The doctor also said if they ordered a CT or MRI they were positive there would be tears. 

Do you see anything abnormal in the x-rays? What do you think is wrong? Any suggestions?

146czou,Sneakers,"Need recs for casual ""lifestyle"" shoes with good arch support (m/33)","Recently moved from a stuffy government job to a more casual office setting. I'm fairly trendy, but for a while my shoe game consisted of leather dress shoes during the week and some bulky Asics with super stability control on the weekends.

I'd like to find a few pairs of some versatile ""lifestyle"" type sneakers I can wear with khakis, jeans, or shorts.

I really like Nike's Court Vision style (pic attached), but the problem is my flat feet! My feet have pretty strong pronation and my left ankle pronates so much it looks broken. Shoes with narrow soles or little arch support tend to cave inward when I wear them; they look strange and obviously over time they crease and break down. My feet are a little wider than average as well--not so wide that I need sized-wide shoes, but obviously it's much harder for narrow soles to support feet that are flat AND wide.

Does anyone have any recommendations? I like the Nike Court Vision because they're leather white sneakers with a subtle dash of color/character in the logo, but there's just not enough support. I know people rave about Hokas and On, but I've yet to see a style that doesn't look like a trainer/running shoe. I'd also prefer not to spend $100+ on a pair unless I absolutely have to.

Anyone have experience on finding shoes that are trendy, simple, AND supportive?",2023-06-10 22:24:20+00:00,4,7

Here's the thing - I'm a big guy, and I like to MOVE. I jog, I hike, etc. I'd rather pay a few bucks for a good shoe rather than have to throw them away every couple of months.",2023-06-08 12:50:13+00:00,0,3

My left ankle (top of foot into shin) started to bother me before my half-marathon in April but I got some insoles and it went away. 

I then got the Clifton 9‚Äôs from Hoka and have been running in those. I just ran another half this past Sunday and during the race I was fine, but my foot is now causing me pain, esp when I flex my foot. Both knees are also bothering me but it‚Äôs not severe‚Äî more a bother than a pain.

Went to a running specialist shoe store and I got the Saucony Endorphin Speed 3‚Äôs to alternate with my Hoka‚Äôs. They said it will help my knees because they are more responsive than the Hoka‚Äôs. I also still have my inserts.

13zmg3d,FootFunction,Start of bunion post foot surgery - how to address,"I (25F) am at my wits end when it comes to foot pain. I work on my feet as general manager of a restaurant.

Starting in 2019 when I was a waitress I began experiencing pain in my left foot in/around my big toe. I went to urgent care and was diagnosed with a stress fracture. I was told to wear better footwear and insoles. I will admit at the time I was dressing for fashion not function. 

Fast forward to approx 1 year ago. I started experiencing foot pain that was even worse than what I experienced in 2019. Instead of going to urgent care I decided to visit a podiatrist. He does an exam and X-Ray. I was diagnosed with Sesamoiditis and an accessory (extra) sesamoid in that foot. I was told to wear a non weight bearing walking boot for one month and then return.

The boot did not help. While the swelling went down, it made my lower back hurt like hell. I decided to go for a second opinion at this time. Doctor number two confirmed Sesamoiditis and sent me to get custom orthotics.

The first doctor I went to ordered an MRI after I tried the boot with minimal relief. MRI FINDINGS: Severe edema in multipartite tibial sesamoid.

This as stress fatigue fracture versus bipartite sesamoid with isolated severe stress response.

Defer to clinical setting.
Remaining distal tendons are intact. Romaining muscle bulk is unremarkable.

Neurovascular bundles are unremarkable

First metatarsophalangeal joint space osteoarthritis with regions of chondromalacia
Associated capsulitis.
Laterally shifted sesamoids without sesamoid fracture.
Soft tissue swelling.
Hammertoe deformities.
Hallux valgus.
Perineural fibrosis of the second interspace, 3 mm short-axis dimension, a ""pre-Morton neuroma""
No enhancement.
Distal phalanx marrow edema, most notable third and fourth toes; stress response or contusions.
No displaced fracture of the distal phalanx of any toc.
No evidence of neoplasm.
Distal plantar fascia is intact.
Lisfranc joint is anatomically aligned. The Lisfranc ligament is intact.
Low-grade plantar plate tear of the fourth metatarsophalangeal joint central attachment to proximal phalanx. No full-thickness component. No lateral component.
Accessory collateral ligaments and collateral ligaments are intact.
No subluxation of the proximal phalanx.

IMPRESSION:
1. Severe edema in multipartite tibial sesamoid, stress fatigue fracture versus bipartite sesamoid with isolated severe stress response. Defer to clinical setting.
2. Perineural fibrosis of the second interspace, 3 mm short-axis dimension, a ""pre-Morton neuroma"". No enhancement.
3. Distal phalanx marrow edema, most notable third and fourth toes; stress response or contusions
No displaced fracture of the distal phalanx of any toe.
4. Low-grade plantar plate tear of the fourth metatarsophalangeal joint.

MRI was in December. After receiving results my doctor presented solutions and I chose surgery. I had surgery in February of this year and was doing great until 3 weeks ago. 

My physical therapist believes I have the start of a bunion. It hurts right where my scar from surgery is. I bought those plastic toe spacer things and have been wearing them. I only wear HOKAs with my custom orthotics in. I walk around barefoot as little as possible. 

I am a very active person. I cannot live with this pain. Should I return to my podiatrist? Should I try different shoes? What bunion solutions have you tried? 

Please, I am desperate. I am only 25 years old for crying out loud, I have so much life to live. I don‚Äôt want to be in pain.",2023-06-03 19:14:49+00:00,8,8

Pic of one of those gait things at Dick's, probably doesn't have any worthwhile info, but still...

For context, I thought I was an ultraboost fan but in my current sneaker trying spree I'm realizing I may be missing out on better stuff.

Also I tend to only have one or two active shoes at a time since I'm not running or doing any sports, just occasionally walking a lot.

I've been trying on several different show types, and I'm wondering if there's some significantly better shoe for me I've been missing out on.....And/or if some insoles are needed, and if so, how would I find out what kind 

I've been testing new sneakers at home by just using my standing desk for 30 min at a time to see if they start hurting

*Current shoes*: just referred to as ""ultraboost shoes"" by my reciept from 2019. I like them quite a bit, but standing around for more than 30 minutes results in general foot pain, more towards the heel with some arch pain.

*Hoka clifton 9*: quite rounded front and back, probably too much so. I appreciate the cushioning but the rounded rear resulted in a good but of ball of my feet pain after I stood around/walked around with a heavy load for a few hours

*Allbird trail runner SWT*: similar issues to the Cliftons, they also had some strange pressure points which I wasnt a fan of 

*Ultraboost 1.0*: closest to my current shoes, but similar problems. I suspect the cushioning is a little firmer but that could just be due to the age of my current shoes

*Ultraboost 22*: loads of cushion, to the point where they feel kinda heavy and don't breathe as well as my current shoes

*NMD_R1*: I appreciate the more enclosed form, and I do like the looks, but they're pretty flat-feeling and don't cushion as well

For other possibilities I was going to try, I've heard good things about the new balance 2002r, the Nike air max 90, and the Nike pegasus 39

Or could all my woes be solved by just combining the nmd_r1s which I like the looks of best, with some magic insole?",2023-05-31 21:48:22+00:00,3,3
13v4gkk,sesamoid,Shoe advice between Hoka models: Bondi vs Tor Ultra low,"Hi everyone. Long time lurker, first time poster here. Ive been dealing with sesamoiditis in my big toe for about a year now. No fracture seen in ultrasound or xrays originally but I had a sharp broken glass sensation in my left big toe for about a month when it began, and now have been living with a chronically inflamed toe. Ive been using new balance 990s and merrell moabs to walk while also trying to be conscious of my tendency to overpronate. However, im having a bad flare up currently and am looking at some new shoes. Right now, im looking at a pair of hoka bondis and a pair of hoka tor ultra lows. Ive seen the bondis recommended on here. However I wanted to ask if anyone here has any experience with the Tor Ultra lows. They seem to be pretty similar but with a more rugged outsole. And a slightly smaller angle on the back heel too, perhaps. Would love to hear from anyone who has potentially tried both shoes and to see if the Tor Ultras would be good for this condition like the Bondis are. Im also looking at Birkenstocks right now but have had some worries about the toe bridge being in an irritating spot considering my big toe callus/inflammation. Anyways thanks for reading and thanks in advance for any comments.

I have been to a running shoe store and did the foot analysis thing where you walk on a treadmill and it scans your feet and checks your hair any everything. I have high arches and a narrow heel. My gait was nornal. They gave me expensive shoes and inserts, which did not help. 

I just got a pair of Hokas and they seems to have fixed the pain! Yay! But, they're making my toes go numb. Mostly just the little toes. I measured my feet for sizing and returned them and got a half size up, but it still happened. What is this?? What can I do to make the toe numbness go away, or are these just not the right shoes? Whats the burning pain?",2023-05-26 23:40:19+00:00,1,1

13sgtqf,hiking,Anyone ever try Superfeet in their Salomon Ultra 4 GTX?,"I just had to cut my hiking vacation in Ireland short because of terrible blisters on the bottom of my feet caused by poor fitting Hoka boots.  I did a lot of research before the trip and had narrowed it down to the Hokas and Salomons but decided on the Hokas because I was doing 20 miles a day, sometimes on pavement, and the extra cushioning seemed like a good idea.  Unfortunately after 60 miles my feet were destroyed.  I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because I went up a half size to protect my toes or if it was the high mileage or if they‚Äôre just the wrong boots for me.  In any case I wish I‚Äôd gone with the Salomons.  I had been leaning that way in the first place but because of the half sizing up, the high arch was slightly shifted forward in a way that I thought it might be a problem.  Anyway, I‚Äôm going to go with the Salomons from here on out but wondered if swapping out the insoles for Superfeet inserts might help with arch issue.

13qunuk,XXRunning,Length of time it took you to recover from extensor tendonitis/pinched nerve?,"Looking for info, don‚Äôt know if anyone else has dealt with this and how long it took people to recover.   :( it‚Äôs been a month since I‚Äôve been able to run and it is rough. Weightlifting and low impact cardio is fine, but it‚Äôs not the same and I‚Äôm having a hard time. 


Been running seriously for about a year and did my research, felt like I was doing everything right. I ratcheted up my miles slowly, got fitted for the right shoes, made sure to stretch after, and did a ton of cross-training with single leg exercises. Hired a dietitian and made sure I was fueling right.


I got a pair of new shoes, Hokas, and had to get the wide since the regular felt tight ‚Ä¶ well right one was a smidge too wide so I did the heel lock lacing. Ran 14 miles, felt awesome. Couple days later, ran three, all great! Next morning, as soon as I hit the treadmill, I get this pain all on the top of my foot. Extensor tendonitis most likely. I did notice my tib ant was crazy tight and sore. Started foam rolling that. 


Well, I took a few days off and returned the Hokas. Few days later, loosened my Brooks and ran a few miles a few days later, but got some weird numbness, so I took a week off. 

Tried another few miles a week later, same pain plus numbness only it‚Äôs worse. Went to a Physio consult and they said it seemed like I had a mild pinched nerve and they gave me some exercises. Said to come back for a full evaluation if that didn‚Äôt solve it. 

I took three weeks off running, and was doing the exercises. Band exercises, calf stretches, calf raises. Elliptical and weightlifting to keep fit. 


Then yesterday I tried some of the single leg hops in the PT ‚Äúback to running‚Äù program and while they didn‚Äôt hurt, BAM, the numbness came right back two hours later. Foot still tingling today. Doesn‚Äôt really hurt. 


I couldn‚Äôt get another PT appointment for two weeks. And I‚Äôm like. Despairing. I joined a run club and miss my running friends, and this was how I was coping with my divorce, and it‚Äôs just a lot. 


Let me know if anyone‚Äôs dealt with this and how long it took for you to recover. It is so frustrating because everything was literally fine, no pain or warning at all. And everything online says extensor tendinitis should clear up after a few days of loosening laces,  but here it is a month later and I haven‚Äôt really run at all and I don‚Äôt know why this is happening. At least I have an appointment but it‚Äôs not until June.

Support and experiences welcome. It‚Äôs pathetic but the last week has been rough and I can‚Äôt even run it off and I just straight up cried today.",2023-05-24 19:10:51+00:00,11,16

13pb1cr,PlantarFasciitis,"Think im in the early stages, wondering how to stop it getting worse","Hi everyone,

I think im in the earlier stages of PF. I first noticed it last summer when i was doing a combination of working on a shop floor (hard concrete) for 6ish hours a day, and then walking a couple of miles playing golf a few times a week, with bad golf shoes. i would notice pretty strong pain in the bottom of my feet when id wake up in the morning, but it would go away after a few minutes of walking around the house. A few months after, i would notice the pain coming back after sitting at a desk for more than an hour or two, Bought some Hoka's since the hard floor was also causing some lower back pain, but they dont seem to be helping the PF at all. Cut to now, its almost every time i get up from my desk chair, and lasts for a while in the mornings. bought some new golf shoes that are pretty high end, and continue to wear the Hokas with high arch insoles (granted, only have worn those for a couple weeks). Now, i wouldn't say its chronic, it comes and goes. Sometimes ill walk 9 holes of golf and the next day will be brutal, sometimes i dont even notice it. might go a few days without feeling anything in the mornings, might not be able to sit for more than half an hour without it coming roaring back once i get up. 

Now, for some history, ive been running around barefoot for as long as i can remember, Id go days in the summertime without putting on shoes at all, even ran a Forest 5k barefoot. i had callouses like elephant skin. but then i grew up, got an office job, and just dont get to spend as much time outside anymore. Did the tester thing at Walmart and it does say i have super flat feet. Talked to my parents and both of them have flat feet so im gonna go with bad genetics. 

My questions is.....what's the internet hive mind recommend for how to at least slow the progress? Is it jogging in the grass, new shoes, give the insoles more time, the tennis ball, thoughts and prayers, or total foot replacement surgery? I want to be clear, im thankfully not at the stage where my movement is impeded, but asking the internet is cheap so figured why not.

Currently, I'm eyeing the Air Max 90 and a few models from New Balance, but I'm open to other suggestions as well.

I will be camping along the way. My current pack baseweight is about 6,5kg. I think it will be about 8kg in total with consumables. I‚Äôm 160cms tall and weigh about 51kg.

And I‚Äôm currently on a desperate search for appropriate footwear! I went to an outdoorsy shop and was recommended the Meindl Borneo in size 38 with sidas high arch hiking insoles. The guy said I would definitely need something like this to support my ankles because of my packweight. But I find them so heavy duty for what I‚Äôve been told the terrain is like on the TMB.

I have 2 different sized fairly wide feet with high arches. One is 36,5 and one is 37. I did get the Sidas high arch hiking insoles. I think I will need at least a size 38 because of the insole and because I will be wearing a merino liner sock with another merino sock on top.

On all my previous hikes I‚Äôve either had very heavy bulky classic hiking shoes that were just too clunky on me. I‚Äôve also gotten halfway the West Highland Way wearing Hoka ATR 6 GTX in size 37 1/2 and they were just horrible. Black toenail on my bigger foot and I would get sweaty and slip around in them. I also rolled my ankle pretty badly. The toes on my big foot were so beaten up by day 5 that I had to quit the trail.

So what I‚Äôm essentially looking for is a hybrid between a trailrunner and a boot, I think. Someting mid-length, good for wider feet, somewhat light weight and absolutely no goretex! The latter seems to be the main thing that makes my search so difficult.

I‚Äôve been looking at some of the Adidas Terrex line, the older Altra Lone Peak models, the Altra Hike 1 and 2, some salomons‚Ä¶

I've just started my barefoot / foot strengthening journey, so please bear with me if I say something stupid!

I love to run and hike. I was having a lot of minor injuries and niggles, mostly ankle and Achilles, and the balls of my feet can be quite tender.

I just recently got back into running ‚Äî I ran on and off in college and I only graduated a couple of years ago but I wanted to get back into running and set myself a goal to run in a 5K on August 16th. When I ran with my old running shoes (which I‚Äôve had since high school), it was awful ‚Äî I could feel a hard impact hit my feet with each step and I really hurt my calves and shins which took me out for a few days. I decided it was time to get myself fitted and get some new running shoes. So, I went out to a running store my friend suggested to me a while back where they fit your feet and find shoes that are good for how you walk. I ended up with a pair of Hoka Clifton 9 running shoes.

This morning I went out on my run, I stretched and did some dynamic exercises before going on, and I tried a new route that was more of a scenic route but also a bit more hilly.

I don‚Äôt know what it was, but even going downhill I started to feel uncomfortable. I figured it was because my feet weren‚Äôt used to the shoes yet, and I went on. Maybe after 3 intervals of running (I‚Äôm currently doing run 1 min/walk 1 min x10) I started to feel REALLY uncomfortable. I started getting this dull ache in my right calf and back of my ankle, so I decided to walk the rest of the way before I injured myself.

So my question is, is it normal to experience more discomfort/pain with new running shoes? Do I have to break them in? With my last pair of running shoes, even though they were harder on my feet I went 5 intervals of running before I couldn‚Äôt anymore.

I want the super cushiness of hoka (at worst I'll just buy some of their boots and use insoles) but I need the stability to correct my gait. I wear a size 5 so my options tend to be limited, and trying boots on in stores doesn't usually work out for me because nobody carries 5's in-store. I always have to order online

ETA: in case anyone searches in the future and finds this,  I ended up buying the Hoka TenNines and I do love them but I still needed to put my insoles in them.

12x5sss,AskDocs,MRI interpretation for 8 month ball of foot pain - cartilage fracture & ‚Äòmild‚Äô sesamoiditis - help to understand [IMAGES],"31F, active dancer, can‚Äôt walk properly since trauma in Sept ‚Äò22. 

MRI screenshots - https://imgur.com/a/ysoYu0G

Hi docs/radiographers/orthopaedic experts. I injured my big toe joint ~8 months ago. I slid off a rock in a river and came down hard with my body weight and force of moving water onto the ball of my R foot, hyperextending the toe joint.
Had pain and mild swelling beneath and on top of great toe joint.

Got xray and ultrasound 6 weeks later, another ultrasound and CT scan at 3 months later. Results were no fractures, with adventitial bursitis and synovitis in 1st and 2nd metatarsophalangeal joints. 

Have been seeing a podiatrist and wearing supportive HOKA shoes with orthotics with rigid splint for R great toe. Have had minimal improvement and very painful flare-ups if I attempt to walk through the big toe joint as normal.

Podiatrist eventually ordered an MRI. I have received the images and podiatrist delivered verbal results over the phone - DIAGNOSIS: cartilage fracture of 1st toe joint and mild sesamoiditis. 

Am waiting to see the written results at appointment later this week & podiatrist says the treatment will be going into a Darco boot for 4 weeks, but the cartilage won‚Äôt heal.

I am not a doctor, but some MD friends looking at the images said the sesamoids look like one or both could also be fractured?

The pain in the sesamoid area is the worst, extending up into the arch at times, and I felt like I could feel a ‚Äòclicking‚Äô when I pushed where the sesamoid closest to the inside of the foot is (L sesamoid on R foot).

Do you agree with the diagnosis by looking at the MRI photos? And is there hope for me healing and returning to dancing and walking? Is further conservative treatment of Darco boot possibly enough? This injury is killing my physical and mental health a bit and would prefer to do what is needed sooner rather than later. I am thinking to fork out money to see an orthopaedic surgeon to assess but thought I could ask for advice here first?

Humongous thank you in advance üôè",2023-04-24 06:23:03+00:00,1,2
12vhqsf,FootFunction,"[25M] Persistent Left 2nd MTP & toe pain for the last several months. Nothing gives it lasting relief, feeling hopeless","This will be a long post, TL;DR: injured my 2nd left MTP several months ago, everything I've tried (from orthotics, metatarsal pads, HOKAs and rest to strengthening the feet and wearing more functional/transitional footwear like Altras) and every specialist I've seen (pedorthist, sports doctor, rehab specialist, orthotist, physio) hasn't helped . Feeling very hopeless as I cannot be active or even walk pain-free. Any advice and tips to help relieve the pain would be greatly appreciated!

I \[25M\] injured my left 2nd toe last July. I was sitting on the couch watching netflix one night and for some reason I was popping the knuckles of my toes. I gave the 2nd left toe a little too much of a pull to the inside and I immediately felt a rush of pain and I knew something was wrong. I didn't know much about foot function at the time and I had a mild case of turf toe in my right foot in high school that kinda went away on its own after about a week so I just tried to go about my days without trying to put too much load through the joint. The pain is at its greatest at push-off or propulsion. 

That didn't work at all so I did my own research on the issue and tried to use felt metatarsal pads to offload the ball of my foot. My foot has a very high and stiff arch so using a single pad didn't offload the issue entirely. Around 3 months after the initial injury, I booked an appointment with my family doctor, at this point I couldn't even walk straight. Every few steps I was veering off to the left since my left foot was very unstable at push-off. Two days before that I was helping a friend move a couch. I lost my balance, had to use my bad foot to keep myself up and ended up injuring my 1st MTP and hallucis abductor (probably from not using the foot as intended and tried to do too much too soon with it). 

Got X-rays and ultrasound on the left foot. X-ray comes back with ""mild-to-moderate osteoarthritis in the great toe MTP joint from a remote history with a loose body, and calcification from a fracture that previously healed. There is also a plantar spur."" I have never had a problem with the left foot in my life so I was stunned to hear about a ""previous fracture."" My doctor also told me the arthritis in the toe was caused from ""popping my knuckles too much,"" something that has been proven to be entirely false time and time again so I was frustrated with what I was hearing. 

I was recommended for orthotics and physio to help with the recovery. I went and saw a pedorthist who assessed my gait and function of my feet and I was fitted for orthotics. At this point I was doing a lot of research on foot function and knew that orthotics should only be temporary and my pedorthist agreed. The plan was to wear them with HOKA Bondi shoes, and once pain-free for around 3 weeks straight, start to transition out of them. I thought this was a good plan as long as everything worked out as intended. 

Problem was that the orthotics didn't give me complete relief. They underwent 3 adjustments, was pain-free for 2-3 days and them back to square one. The adjustments were creating pockets for the 1st and 2nd MTPs, metatarsal bar, extra support behind the 2nd MTP, and more aggressive arch support to help offload the problem areas. I was doing exercises during this entire time such as: banded big toe flexion, extension and abduction, seated calf raises to tolerance, and single leg balance to tolerance. I had an appointment with a rehabilitation specialist in February to discuss options since the orthotics and physio wasn't really working. He suggested orthotics again and referred me to an orthotic clinic with an appointment a few weeks away. I had asked about the possibility of injections into the area (said it would make it much worse, which I believe), and possibly returning to a walking boot just to calm down the symptoms (which he shot down as a boot is highly restrictive). I left frustrated and felt like I had to take matters into my own hands. 

I went and bought Graham Tuttle's ""Functional Feet"" program right after that appointment, which is where I began to learn about barefoot shoes, toe spacers, toe socks, foot function and everything else about this community (which has been amazing and a real eye opener to say the least!). I made it my goal to transition to barefoot shoes entirely once I'm free of this 2nd MTP pain. For the first half everything was going well, I ditched my orthotics and just wore my HOKAs normally while doing his daily exercises. The ones with any loading of the foot through toe extension were painful, so I regressed them to a tolerable level or just left them out entirely. After the conclusion of the program (mid March), I was feeling good and tried to do my normal duties as an engineer and do very small site walks in my blundstone steel-toe boots. Also at this point my big toe was pain-free, but a little stiff compared to the right. I was only on-site for 30mins a day for 3 days straight, but it was enough to suffer a bad setback in my recovery. My new orthotic appointment was days away and I really didn't want to go to it, but I felt like I needed to regress to orthotics again to help calm things down. 

The orthotist gave my current set a facelift to try and solve my issues. At this point I started feeling pain in my right 2nd MTP (most likely as a result of favouring that side for so long and with my compensations in my gait), so the same was done to both insoles. The right one fit very well, the left one did not. It felt like my left foot was in constant supination and was very painful so they didn't last 2 days. 

At this point I knew I had to take matters into my own hands even further, I sacrificed the insoles of an old pair of shoes and created a makeshift ""floating metatarsal head"" setup, where I cut out the insole from the midfoot and forward for every metatarsal head EXCEPT for the 2nd to keep it from contacting the bottom of the shoe. This worked for about a week until the pain came back which really frustrated me. 

I then started to plan for when the issue is dealt with, so I bought a pair of Altra Escalantes, a pair of ""Wild Toes"" toe spreaders from The Foot Collective, and some VWell toe socks from Amazon. My follow-up with the orthotist was a few days after, and I mentioned that the ""floating metatarsal head"" set up had some success so we went with a combo of that, a metatarsal bar and the already aggressive arch support. We spend almost 3 hours making every tiny adjustment possible for the orthotic to properly offload the left 2nd MTP. Nothing was successful, she recommended I go back to a walking boot for 2-4 weeks and that I go see a physiatrist (chronic pain rehab specialist). I felt so deflated after that, which is when I finally tried to transition into my Altras and start gradually wearing my toe spreaders. Things were going okay, I found wearing the toe spreaders gave me some relief walking barefoot and that I was able to fully splay my toes with wearing the Altras with the toe socks. 

It wasn't until over a week ago where I had another problem with the orthotics and HOKA combo. I went to a hockey game and had to walk like 10-15 mins to the arena and back from the car, the most walking I had to do since I initially injured my foot. I tried to be mindful of the 2nd MTP and toe so I attempted to emphasize the big toe to take on the load it's supposed to. It was fine in the moment, however the next day the peroneals in both legs were very painful. Any walking of over 10 mins in these orthotics would bring me a lot of pain either way which sank me to a new low of hopelessness.

That's when I decided to start wearing my Altras full-time. It worked for the last few days, but as of yesterday and today I'm feeling like I'm back where I started with the pain. 

I am out of ideas and don't know what to do next or where to turn for some immediate relief. I had a virtual consult with ""Gait Happens"" last week and I am doing drills and exercises to help teach my foot to pronate and also work on my hip internal rotation, which I know will take a while. My current daily routine for my feet involves toe splay, toe yoga, massage with a cork ball, and manually flexing and extending each digit individually to tolerance. The pain in the both 2nd MTPs and toes is at its greatest at push-off and extension. I don't know if its capsulitis or a possible plantar plate tear. I intend to order an MRI next time I see my sports doctor. Does anyone here have any recommendations for me? I'd be very grateful for any help and advice. 

Before everything, I was very active, lifting 3 times a week and doing some form of cardio 2 times a week (walking, running, biking). I was also a rugby player throughout my university years, hoping to get back to it this summer but that's looking impossible now. This injury has taken over my life and ruined it in every way possible. The mental aspect of this chronic foot pain is really starting to overwhelm me and put me into a dark place. 

Some info about my feet and their function: I have average passive ROM in the toes, but there's a considerable gap in the active ROM (I can't lift them off the floor very high). My feet have high and stiff arches, they do not pronate at all during gait. My feet are also naturally externally rotated, which means I naturally have a low-gear push-off. I have sprained my right ankle twice from rugby, which has limited the dorsiflexion on that side compared to the left. I do not utilize the ROM I have passively during gait. I think the sprains have caused me to have a lot less neuromuscular control of the toes in my right foot. My hips have a lot of external rotation, but limited internal rotation (I believe I have a retroverted anatomy of my femur's connection to the pelvis, I have to have a wide stance with externally rotated feet in order to squat below parallel). 

Any advice, feedback and comments are greatly appreciated!",2023-04-22 20:12:58+00:00,4,6

As people here may know, getting good orthotics is only half the battle in avoiding heel pain, they must be paired with supportive shoes to do their job. What exactly makes shoes supportive enough is hard to pin down so trying them on and walking around is the only way to be sure that they'll do the job. 

As someone who's had PF for almost 3 years I've spent a lot of time trying different footwear options and I now have a solid selection of shoes that I like the look of and also allow me to walk all day pain free (when paired with my custom orthotics). I'd like to share my finidngs to save other people trouble in searching for good fotwear.

These are all shoes that I have owned for a while and not just tried on.

# Casual wear

## Solovair

I have the [dealer boots](https://uk.nps-solovair.com/collections/dealer-boot) and the [3 eye gibson shoes](https://uk.nps-solovair.com/collections/mens/Gibson-Shoe) from this brand, although I'm sure anything else from them would be just as good (except the sneakers probably). The dealer boots are probably the most comfortable footwear that I own, even more than my runners.

They don't come with removable footbeds so I go up half a size to accommodate full-length orthotics. I'm usually a UK8 so I buy UK8.5.

## Joseph T

I stumbled across this Korean brand by accident when looking for some side-zip boots, they're very stylish, nice for the price and work well with my inserts. I have the [Maro](https://josepht.ca/products/maro) boots in two colours, I reckon their other styles would also work well except perhaps the sneakers and the crepe sole styles (e.g. Mocca).

Sizing can be tricky. In my experience with the Maro style they run quite large so sizing down half from your usual shoe size will give you enough room for your foot and a full length insert. I'm a UK8 and I wear the US8.5 with my inserts. Their .ca site offers returns though so you can always send them back if they don't fit.

# Active Wear

I'm only recommending specific models here because I've found that there's a lot of variation in the different kinds of footwear that sports and hiking brands offer and generally only a very narrow selection work for me.

## [HOKA - Arahi 6](https://www.hoka.com/en/gb/arahi-6/) (running)

Running shoes have been a tricky one for me and these are the only ones that have truly worked and allowed me to run long distances without any pain. They have a removable footbed so I went with my true size, I also got the wide fit because I have wide feet.

## [Brasher - Country Master](https://www.brasher.co.uk/250717/250717-brs-m-country-mast) (Hiking, also music festivals)

These have an almost completely rigid sole which rolls as you walk, so your foot doesn't need to flex.

# General Footwear Tips

As I said, it's hard to tell if a pair of shoes is going to work or not but I've picked up a couple of rules of thumb. 

- Grab the heel and the toe of a shoe and twist, if the sole twists very easily (e.g. converse) then that's not a supportive shoe and it won't help you.

- For non-sneaker shoes, particularly those with a raised heel, it's a good sign if the construction involves a shank. A shank is a rigid piece of material in the middle part of the sole that keeps it rigid. This is essential for heeled shoes which have part of the sole off the ground because it provides solid support in this area, whereas otherwise it would just sag under your weight. For example, Solovair and Dr. Martens shoes look very similar but only Solovairs work for me. The difference? Solovairs have a shank but Dr. Martens have cheaped out and no longer use them.

Hopefully this is helpful for people.",2023-04-12 14:00:49+00:00,8,3

12iabg4,bunions,12 weeks post op!,"Quick background: I (28 F) had a distal first metatarsal osteotomy on my right foot on January 10th, it has overall been a pretty easy recovery, which you can read about in my other posts if you're curious about the journey. 

Hello again! I wanted to pop back in with a lil update for the handful of you who are curious and the folks who might find this information helpful in the future. 

I‚Äôm not gonna lie, the last six weeks kinda sucked. Not due to pain or other physical issues, but because of my expectations. I think I thought that I‚Äôd hit the six week mark and just breeze on through, walking and whatever. Alas, that is just not how that works. It‚Äôs been a transition, and I think if I‚Äôd had a better understanding of how it would go then I wouldn‚Äôt have been so put out about it. Also, I didn‚Äôt realize I‚Äôd need to wear shoes all the time? My big pro tip, order yourself some house hokas before you transition out of the boot! 

But! There is a silver lining. Around the 10/11 week mark, I noticed a huge improvement. And now, at the 12/13 week mark? Hell yeah. It‚Äôs definitely still up and down ‚Äî lots of stiffness in my big toe and I‚Äôm not back to my usual level of activity yet ‚Äî but I‚Äôm back to seeing those little incremental improvements. Swelling is going down, the other day I realized it‚Äôs comfortable to walk around without shoes on in the house again. I‚Äôm doing physical therapy as well and that‚Äôs helping too.

12h7l59,PlantarFasciitis,Hoka‚Äôs?! Worth it?,"Hey guys. first post here. i have been dealing with what i am almost sure is plantar fasciitis for approx 6 months now. i used to wear terrible uncomfy flat shoes like converse for so long so i needed new shoes for this pain. i got the new balances fresh foam  880 v12 and they‚Äôre comfy. they just don‚Äôt feel that supportive for what im needing. after standing for a few hours at work i feel like im kinda sinking into the shoe. i have been wanting to upgrade my pair of everyday walking shoes and have heard some hype on Hoka. I‚Äôve seen the clifton 9, bondi. do you guys have experience with these shoes? Are they worth the upgrade? or does anyone have any other brand or model recommendations that they felt have been more supportive, and can withstand in more long term at work? i appreciate any comments at all!",2023-04-10 04:53:29+00:00,30,56

I think I have most of my mobility and strength back and it doesn‚Äôt feel like joint pain so I‚Äôm not really sure what‚Äôs wrong. I read on a post here awhile ago about how patients lose the fat pads on the bottoms of their feet after surgery and I think that may be the case. Does anyone have any insight on that? And are there any ways to mitigate that or is it just a waiting game?

Another reason I think it could be due to fat loss in my foot is because my regular running shoes don‚Äôt feel like they have enough cushion anymore. I run Hokas and Brooks Glycerins which are very cushioned but they just feel hard.

I ran 15 miles yesterday just to see if I could make it past a half marathon and I felt fine. 

My question is, what training plan would y‚Äôall recommend? How many shoes should I be rotating? What shoes do y‚Äôall recommend?

11u7fa6,sesamoid,10 months since initial injury - was told I have avascular necrosis and R lateral sesamoid needs to come out. Any similar experiences?,"Injured training for a 10k March 2022. PCP thought it was arthritis at first, but didn't see a podiatrist until August who took x rays and gave me the d/x of sesamoiditis. Managed with taping and stiffer shoes at first, then eventually a steroid shot and boot in October. During this time pain went from a 6-8 to a 3-4. November I went for the orthotics and souped-up Hoka Bondis after the pain crept back up to the 5-7 range. It has essentially persisted as a 3-4 since then. Saw a general ortho in February after growing frustrated with the podiatrist, who did an MRI and Radiologist found no fracture, ortho just scolded me for not resting enough (even though I've been staying 3-5k steps daily or less). My left sesamoid area started hurting last week, so I went to an ortho who specializes in foot and ankle who reviewed MRI, old x rays, took new x rays, and stated that the right lateral sesamoid has necrosis and it's going to need to come out, and there's basically no way it can recover once it's at that point. Seems like a really smart guy, but I didn't realize I could still necrotize without the fracture.

&#x200B;

At this point, I'm just frustrated. I've seen 4 doctors, tried taping, a bunch of different shoes (Hoka Mach 5, Hoka Bondi, Altrak shoes), rest, daily contrast baths for *months* with twice on the weekends, a complete halting of any cardio that even touches the sesamoid, custom insoles and dancers pads of all thicknesses and materials, supplementing a million different vitamins and herbs, low inflammatory diet, 2x week course of NSAID, oral and topical, and still nothing. I don't even need to run again, I just want to be able to go on long walks with my family.

&#x200B;

I guess there's some relief knowing that it's already necrotized, as that was my fear the entire time, but I'm hoping someone on this subreddit can offer me their experiences or their thoughts. I'm leaning towards going for the surgery but am waffling.",2023-03-17 23:19:06+00:00,3,14
11u43fb,bunions,Lapiplasty bunionectomy recovery thread,"I am a 50yo woman who had a lapiplasty bunionectomy on my right foot a week ago after 20 years of foot ailments (plantar fasciitis, bunions, no arch, genes of lovely people with bad feet) and self-abuse (roller skates, cheap and pointy shoes) only somewhat relieved by non-surgical methods (wearing HOKAs exclusively, toe separators, custom insoles, PT, steroid shots, shock wave treatment, walking boot). Finally have great insurance, enough sick time, and the ability to work from home (thanks COVID!) so now was the right time to do this.

TW: acknowledgment of menstruation and queer people. Please leave if that bothers you.

I will update as I go. Feel free to ask questions and share your experience. Do not be a jerk. That's what the outside world is for, not my post.

A little background: we live in a house built in 1904 with narrow, uneven hallways, a wonky shaped bathroom, a laundry in the basement that requires outdoor stairs to access, and front stairs I will NOT be attempting to go up or down during this process. Luckily we have access to an alley, but there are still a few stairs back there. My wife and I had long conversations about what I can do (dishes, sit at my desk to work, fold laundry, feed the dogs) and cannot do (drive, laundry, cook, clean, shower, walk the dogs) while healing.  We talked about this for a full YEAR before I had the procedure just so we were on the same page about everything. I made sure to do a few things that required my foot before having this procedure (trained for and ran a 5k, took a wheel-throwing pottery class).

Before surgery: picked up meds and walking boot, got a pedicure (no polish), shaved my toes (so odd since I have almost no hair on my toes), cleaned my house, moved my bedroom furniture so access to the bathroom was easier, set my crutches to the right height, took up area rugs that would get in the way of crutches and scooter, loaded my kindle with streaming videos. Scheduled the dog walker to come mid-day so our dogs don't go feral and start pooping in the house. Although they are chihuahuas, they are only a few missed walks short of rebelling completely.

Day one: got home mid-day with super bandaged foot, prescriptions for gabapentin, tramadol, naproxen, antibiotic and anti-nausea. Foot was numb and I was exhausted.  Used crutches and my partners assistance to get inside and into bed.  I had purchased a leg elevation pillow from amazon ([https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BB9SSTJK/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_asin\_title\_o06\_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BB9SSTJK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)) so I could immediately get good elevation and rest.  Put ice packs on 15min each hour behind my knee and on my ankle. I was sent home with a EBI bone healing system ([https://www.zimmerbiomet.lat/content/dam/zimmer-biomet/medical-professionals/bone-healing/biomet-ebi-bone-healing-system/ebi-bhs-patient-faq-brochure.pdf](https://www.zimmerbiomet.lat/content/dam/zimmer-biomet/medical-professionals/bone-healing/biomet-ebi-bone-healing-system/ebi-bhs-patient-faq-brochure.pdf)) so I put that on and promptly took a lovely, deep, post-anesthesia nap. Didn't feel like eating much and my wife kept track of my med schedule.  I stayed in bed with my leg propped the entire day and night except when using the bathroom. I borrowed a knee scooter from a friend and that was helpful to get around.  I find it easier than crutches.

Day two: More pain as the numbing wore off. Managing the scooter while, essentially, high was hard, and I fell once. That sucked, but I didn't do any damage to my foot. Called my doc because the pain was bad.  He doubled my tramadol and added Tylenol at max strength. Stayed in bed with my foot elevated and EBI bone things on my foot and icing for 15 min every hour. The extra tramadol caused nausea. Ate some, but not much. Making sure to wiggle toes, rotate ankles and move legs around to keep blood clots at bay. Started keeping track of my own meds so my wife could sleep through the night.

Day three: Ditto of day two.  Meds, bed, elevation, EBI, ice, Netflix. And because God hates me I got my period today.

Day four: Moved to the couch for the day. Wearing the boot when I am not sitting in case I put my foot down by accident.  But the pressure hurts and doc said to take it off when sitting or in bed. Cut back on tramadol and anti-nausea meds. Religiously taking naproxen, antibiotic, gabapentin at night and tylenol. Eating more. Feel like I may watch all of Netflix before this is over. Wife is taking excellent care of me. I am really going to owe her when this is done. Getting harder to sleep without meds and an elevated foot.  So basically staying up way too late reading and watching movies.  It is my childhood image of adulthood coming true.

Day five: Follow-up visit with my doc.  Managed a baby-wipe sponge bath so he doesn't think I have gone feral ahead of my dogs. They took x-rays and changed bandages.  Frankenfoot is swollen but doc says it looks good.  Says I can walk with the boot on day 14.  Until then I am using the scooter or crutches to get around. My foot is more aching than painful. Trying to really stay on schedule with the naproxen because I can tell when I miss a dose. It's nice to have less bulky bandages on.

Day six: Since I am off opioids I joined a couple of work calls and what I said made sense! Yay! Then I took a nap. Scooting around the house is getting easier.  Elevation, ice, EBI, meds, binged The Last of Us. I am a public health nerd and loved it. Managed to wash dishes for 15 mins using the scooter to support my leg. Then felt SUPER tired.

Day seven: Definitely more up and about, eating more and feeling more alert. Started wearing a toe splint and it really helps put my toe in the right position for healing. My doc gave it to me but you can buy one here: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078Q32FXQ/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_asin\_title\_o04\_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078Q32FXQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).  Got a bit of work done, elevation, ice, EBI, meds, watched The menu on HBO Max. Sooooo goooood. With the help of my wife I took a bath.  I covered my foot with a cast cover ([https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078Q32FXQ/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_asin\_title\_o04\_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078Q32FXQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)) just in case but mostly just propped it on the side of the tub.  Washing my hair felt like HEAVEN.

Day eight: Foot aches but the meds help. Up more and wearing the boot as I scoot around. Got work done sitting at my desk with leg propped on a chair next to me. Needed to move to the couch to get more elevation. My community has been ah-mazing about bringing food and helping out. Today I ordered very expensive sportsball tickets to thank my wife for her love and care through this. Hopefully she takes me and not someone with good feet to the game.

Day nine: I have restless leg syndrome and last night it kept me up til 3am. Foot is very achey and I am very tired.",2023-03-17 21:17:48+00:00,18,26
11qnp5x,PlantarFasciitis,Misdiagnosed FHL tendinopathy,"My arch pain was misdiagnosed as plantar fasciitis for 9 months. After my podiatrist tried to give me another cortisone injection, I got a **third** opinion and my flexor hallucis longus tendon issues were correctly diagnosed. Posting this here in case anyone else is going through the same thing.

FHL pain can also be felt in the back or inside of the ankle and underneath the base of the big toe.

**Symptoms**

The initial pain wasn‚Äôt severe, but it came on suddenly while I was on the elliptical at high resistance. It felt like my arch was tearing. Biking aggravated it, but running wasn‚Äôt too bad as long as runs were short and slow. A few months later, after slightly increasing my running pace, things started to deteriorate. Walking became painful and I eventually ended up in a boot (which only helped a little). An MRI showed nothing wrong.

I had no pain in my heel, and pain increased over the course of the day with activity (no ‚Äúfirst-step‚Äù pain). In hindsight, these should have indicated it wasn‚Äôt plantar fasciitis. Traditional plantar fasciitis treatments also didn‚Äôt help‚Äîrolling out the bottom of my foot aggravated it, and the stretches did nothing.

**Treatment**

Once I was correctly diagnosed, I started physical therapy 3x/week, consisting almost entirely of deep tissue massage of my calf, trying to get at the FHL tendon‚Äôs muscle belly. This was painful and left me bruised, but the relief in my foot was immediate and within a few weeks I could walk as much as I wanted without pain as long as I wore hiking boots.

At home, I performed stretches (e.g., [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIMGe0cZXpI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIMGe0cZXpI)) and tried deep tissue massage on myself by lying on a trigger point massage tool (e.g., [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00120ZMHS/](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00120ZMHS/) or [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058NWIC2/](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058NWIC2/)).

I have high arches, so Superfeet inserts were too low and made the pain worse. I switched to Sole inserts ([https://yoursole.com/us/shop/footbeds/active-medium](https://yoursole.com/us/shop/footbeds/active-medium)) and they're wonderful.

I also slept in a night split. I‚Äôve tried four different types, and this was by far my favorite: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016ZXWG3O](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016ZXWG3O)

I used Voltaren gel on my arch and took turmeric and magnesium supplements, but I have no idea if those helped‚Äîthe deep tissue massage on my calf was definitely the most important, followed by the stretching.

For running, I switched to Asics stability shoes, which helped get my pronation under control. Hokas made me pronate more, which made the pain worse. (Hokas have been great for some other friends, though!) I don't think running shoe advice can be generalized, because everyone's gait is different.

11fedsx,walking,Best all-day walking shoe for painfully high arches and underpronation?,"I have horribly painful feet from high arches and OVERpronation. I struggle to walk at the end of the day many days, especially if I have multiple days of wear and tear building up and making my tolerance level less and my pain level more. So, I'm looking at better shoes finally! 

When I was younger I had custom inserts from a podiatrist, but that's not possible rn. I use Dr. Scholl or generic brand cheap inserts...as they wear out I buy new ones. I do this a few times a year (it would be more but I STRETCH how long they last). I'm not working with a huge budget, but I'm willing to save up bc I need to start seeing this as a part of my healthcare. It impacts my scoliosis pain and exacerbates my knee issues. I'm not a super heavy person but I do have PCOS and weight comes and goes.

I'm trying to narrow down my choices, can you give me your experiences with these shoes?

1) Brooks Ghost 14 or GTS 21
2) Asics Gel Cumulus 24
3) Hoka Clifton 8
4) Ortho feet Lava or Coral Stretch
5) Asics Gel Venture 7
6) Allbirds Wool Runners

Per my research of reviews and what the shoes offer these are my top choices, so I'm only looking for advice on these specific models. TYIA!!! 

TL;DR Help me choose between the listed shoes for lots of pain from walking and being on my feet all day for work.

I have a good pair of leather hiking boots, and now I'm looking for a light three season shoe for hiking (spring, summer, autumn). I'm thinking of:

Arc'teryx Aerios FL 2 GTX

Hoka Anacapa low GTX 

Salomon X Ultra 4

Salomon XA Pro V8 

I've read that the Salomon X Ultra 4 digs into the ankles. Therefore I'd go for the Hokas or Arc'teryx (preferably the latter due to simple design) but I'm wondering if a GTX shoe may be too hot during summer months. Arc'teryx Aerios FL 2 gets good reviews when it comes to breathability...   
When it comes to Salomon: the quick lace system is handy, but I don't like how this tightens the shoe more around the top than the bottom. On the other hand, Salomon does offer non-GTX versions...

114x8qq,FootFunction,Pain in feet near ball of big toes. Looking for ideas,"Hi, I‚Äôm hoping that by writing up some details of my feet experience someone might have some ideas of what I could try.

I‚Äôm 35M.  I‚Äôve average weight and height.  I don‚Äôt ever do running as an exercise but was decently active with my kids enjoying hiking and being able to walk.


In Sep 2019 I started get this slight pain in my left foot between ball of big toe and next toe.  It would kind of go away the more active I was on the foot for a given day.  But in the morning and after resting it would hurt until warmed up.I went to a podiatrist and we tried anti-inflammatories, a cortisone shot and then some custom orthotics.  The orthotics were half-length of the shoe and annoyingly slid around a lot.  I had an x-ray and nothing was found.  I was told I have high arches and that my big toe structure sits higher than the other 4 toes.After a few months of trying them I started developing pain in my right foot (even had my first gout episode in my right big toe).   From then on I had similar pain in both feet around the balls of my feet.  The Drs thought it was sesamoids and we started down that path. I went back to not wearing my orthotics as they seemed to make things worse.  I tried Hokas but they hurt as well.  I went and saw a sports Dr and again we did x-rays and it showed nothing.  I had an MRI done on my left foot and it didn‚Äôt show inflammation of anything.  Which is kind of stuck in my mind that if it was sesamoids that it would have shown on the MRI.

I went to a new podiatrist who got the company that made my orthotics to make new ones that were full length.  They were at least a lot nicer to walk on since they weren‚Äôt sliding around.  They seemed to help a bit as the pain didn‚Äôt happen as often when walking.  But I would get pain when sitting in a non-perfect sitting pose.  Meaning if I was in a recliner and my feet were hanging off I‚Äôd get pain near the balls of my feet.  If I was on the ground sitting cross-legged with my shoes on I‚Äôd get pain in the balls of me feet.  He tried some thick pads to isolate my big toe ball area but the pain didn‚Äôt get better or worse.  We tried to restrict the entire big toe structure but that made it worse.  At this point he softly let me go as a patient as he‚Äôs out of ideas. I‚Äôm now trying my orthotics in some Brooks shoes but it is really hurting my arch which is weird as I am fully accustomed to these orthotics by now.  I‚Äôve also taken up swimming during this time to get some exercise.  And there are times that kicking moderately kicking my feet hurts these areas.I‚Äôm not sure if anyone has some great ideas?   I‚Äôm kind of out of ideas as any given Dr just feels like they have one hammer that they love and to them any problem can be solved with that single hammer (surgery, orthotics, etc.).   I am a little intimidated by reading through some of the posts that I might not have enough technical info to help get the best help.

Tl;dr;  Pain started in left foot but now both hurt in the same way.  Been happening for 1.5 years.  X-rays and MRI show nothing as far as inflammation or possible fractures.",2023-02-17 20:50:33+00:00,5,7
110x1qw,sesamoid,Advice for sesamoidectomy recovery,"I had my medial sesamoid removed (via incision centered over the tibial sesamoid just plantar to midline). When I was discharged, I was in a boot and I was allowed to put weight on my foot, only on my heel. This is everything I did to prepare, in case it can be helpful for you. 

**Preparations:**

* Meal prepped several meals. I put some in the fridge so I had something to eat after the surgery, and froze most of them so they were ready as I was recovering and working from home 
* Setup stools in the bathroom so I could sit while brushing my teeth & ensured clear pathways from bed to bathroom to couch
* Filed PTO for the surgery day + 4 additional days to rest 
* Did self-care so I felt somewhat well groomed even if I was in recovery on the couch (got a manicure (no pedicure, can‚Äôt have nail polish on toes) and massage)  
* Queued up books from the library using Libby 
* I have no idea if this had any impact, but I started taking a generic multivitamin leading up to the surgery

For day hiking, I own a pair of Merrell Moab mids, and I've been eyeing Hoka Speedgoats.

My question: With hiking boots that provide that kind of support out of the box, would swapping in strong arch insoles defeat the purpose? Or add a useful element? I can imagine it either way.

My previous attempts to ""aftermarket upgrade"" the Merrells involved shopping for cushioning insoles, not support ones. I didn't feel much benefit there.

I am a runner, 50 yrs old, 62 kgs, good shape and no previous foot injuries or other injuries, very good health, no foot malformations and no known mobility issues. I run 25-30 kms a week and have maintained this volume for last 5 years without problems. 

I recently bought Asics magic speed (very stiff carbon plated) shoes and the 2nd time using them, going up a hill felt sudden pain in both feet 2nd metatarsals. Went away after the run but since then the pain (like if I was walking on my metatarsal heads with no padding/cushioning) seems to get a bit worse. It is not limiting yet (I have done a few runs since then, with other shoes - hoka rincon, very little pain, tried again briefly the asics and felt pain immediately) but pain grows though when walking lately.

Read a lot in the web and reddit and seems It is not stress fracture (pain only in bottom), Morton‚Äôs Neuroma or those other more severe injuries. Maybe inflammation of both heads (could become capsulitis?). No significant visible inflammation in any area of the foot. Small hardness area in the skin under 2nd metatarsal head in both feet. No pain when resting. Started to do stretching exercises (toes, fascia, ankles)  and toe strength exercises for last couple weeks but no improvement

Should I stop running or stretching/toe exercises until pain goes away?

108uzp5,FootFunction,shoes for lisfranc recovery?,"Hello! I got a lisfranc injury in June 2022, and got my ORIF in the same month. Since then, I've tried to walk around in both regular running shoes (I've had a Nike Pegasus since early-2022) and regular slippers (where I live, we usually walk around barefoot at home, and in flip flops/slippers outside). My physiotherapist also recommended me to start jogging at the 3-4 month mark of my recovery.

In December 2022 however, my orthopaedic doc told me to stop the running and dynamic exercises as he observed some loosening of the screws. I think he's concerned about hardware failure, and I'm probably scheduled to remove my screws in May/June 2023 (and hopefully my metatarsal gap isn't widening too much!).

Currently, walking around barefoot/in flat slippers gives me slight pain in my midfoot, but I'm able to manage (in both running shoes and slippers) and I've walked upwards of 10k steps a day, which is normal for me pre-injury. But I'd like to take care of my foot and not aggravate the lisfranc injury more, cause I really don't want another surgery for fusion!

I was looking at barefoot shoes before getting injured, do yall think that that's still a possibility in the future? Furthermore, what shoe recommendations do yall have for someone trying to recover? The folks at the lisfranc sub recommended a lot of shoes, like Hokas etc, but I'm not really keen about the rocker soles as I don't think it will help me strengthen my foot in the long run.

Hope to hear some recommendations from you guys!",2023-01-11 04:06:23+00:00,8,16

zxpnql,FootFunction,"I was diagnosed with Hallux Limitus and recommended to wear shoes like Hokas, but they feel worse than wearing vans... I'm confused.","As the title says. I've grown up wearing flat shoes (converse, vans) with no support. My podiatrist says due to my hallux limitus, I should get shoes that prevent the big toes from bending back. That's fine, however every single shoe that's typically recommended for this issue is so overly padded and it leaves my foot with this 'stressed out' feeling. When I put my vans back on, I feel relief. 

I know shoes like vans are not ideal since they squish the toes up, and I suspect that may have contributed to my hallux limitus by pushing the big toes inwards. That said, when I wear them my big toes don't hurt, and the rest of my body (ankles, knees, hips, back) feel a lot more stable than when I'm wearing padded shoes. It's so strange. 

I don't want to *not* follow my podiatrists advice because I would Really be kicking myself if that led to my toes' demise... but frankly it just doesn't feel right wearing these 'maximalist' shoes with all the support.

What the heck should I do? I'm probably going to email my doctor and get her feedback too, but I'm curious to hear others' thoughts.

zq0yzn,bunions,Running shoes for bunions,"I know people periodically ask about running shoes for bunions. The advice is always toe-splay shoes - Hoka, Altra, Xero, Vivobarefoot, etc. The thing is, these shoes are made for people with an idealized oblong natural foot shape and are way too narrow for my bunions in the toe-joint area, and unnecessarily wide in the toe-tip area.

I (32, female) have never had a ""normal"" shaped foot; my feet have been shaped like this for as long as I can remember. No, I'm not getting surgery. For years I ran in [Brooks Ghost 8](https://www.rei.com/media/16f99713-06dd-4f3f-8153-eb0cc0d15f08?size=2000) which magically happen to fit me. I got rid of my Brooks Ghost 8 (which was very hard for me as I keep things forever) after getting a pair of Hoka Clifton 8 Wide. Unfortunately, Hokas don't work for me as they are more of an oblong shape and my bunions hurt after longer runs.

Now I can't find running shoes that fit me and I'm so sad and desperate. I've tried the Brooks Ghost 14 in a Wide and feel so betrayed‚Äì‚Äìthe mesh upper is enormous but the sole of the shoe is not any wider than the normal width. I also tried New Balance 880 Extra Wide and again, the footbed is not as wide as I'd like, while the mesh upper is enormous so my foot slides around.

tl;dr:  I'm looking for an almond-shaped women's running shoe where the area around the toe joint is very wide and the top tapers in. Has anyone found this? Please, I am so desperate to find running shoes so I can run again.

Two, the tongue of the shoe is hurting my ankle pretty bad, it is basically digging into my ankle, when I see these on people's feet in photos it looks like the tongue is looser or goes up higher.

I have bipartite tibial and fibular sesamoids but from the x-rays, my podiatrist is unclear on whether I am bipartite or have a previously fractured tibial sesamoid. 

Went to a podiatrist in January 2022 who recommended Hokas and inserts (Superfeet green) with a homemade/custom cutout around the sesamoid. The Hokas Bondis/Speedgoats and inserts have helped but I have still dealt with pain on and off all year. Would ice and rest a few days (or not) and would push through the pain to continue what I love doing (rock climbing and disc golfing). 

Went back last week after experiencing incredible sesamoid pain after a night of rock climbing (could not really walk the next day). Same podiatrist, took an x-ray, diagnosis: ""*sesamoiditis; possible avascular necrosis/possible degeneration of sesamoid with separation of bipartite or previous fractured segments*"". Recommended treating acute injury with immobilization and put me in an aircast boot for 4 weeks. If rest isn't enough ""*we would consider corticosteroid injection or MRI to image for AVN and potentially may need to have this surgically removed*"". 

Want to get a second opinion from an orthopedist - any Mainers recommend one? Worried about surgery backfiring, getting a bunion, or affecting my climbing abilities by having a weakened foot.

*Note: Crossposting from* r/pelotoncycle*...*

# Race Report

**Name**: Outer Banks Marathon

**Date**: November 13th, 2022

**Distance**: 26.2 miles

**Location**: Outer Banks, North Carolina

**Goal Time**: 4:15:00

**Time**: 4:27:00

**About me**: I have never enjoyed running, with my longest run before the program being around 4 miles. While running a marathon has always been on my bucket list, running even a half seemed wildly unattainable prior to starting the program.

[Full review of the program including weekly and long run schedules here.](https://www.workoutreviews.org/classes/peloton/road-to-26-2/road-to-26-2-review/)

# What I Liked About Peloton‚Äôs Road to 26.2

* Everything feels attainable. By breaking the program into 3 sections, I was able to visualize and work towards 3 different, seemingly-attainable goals while still having the end marathon on the horizon.
* The speed work really helps you understand and improve your pace. Coming from someone who only had three modes prior to the program (walking, jogging, or sprinting), the coaching around ‚Äúintensity levels‚Äù really pushed me to notice fractional differences in my speed and how long I was able to maintain that pace. Come race day, I had a strong understanding of the different paces I would run at for a 5k vs. a half marathon vs. a full marathon.¬†
* For someone that has always struggled with the mental aspect of distance running, having a coach in your ear helps you learn how to speak positively to yourself and distract yourself when the easy choice of quitting presents itself.
* Overall, the coaches are great. Having a diversity in coaches means you will naturally resonate with some over others, but I found that all coaches in the program were able to motivate me and push me beyond my boundaries.

# What I Didn‚Äôt Like About Peloton‚Äôs Road to 26.2

* There is not an audio class for any of your weekly long runs. After having a coach in your ear throughout your other runs, it is hard to adjust to picking your own music and self-tracking your long runs.
* The classes repeat, sometimes for 3 weeks in a row. While the coaches give different instructions for each of the three weeks, re-taking the same class with the same instructor, stories, music, and advice can start to drain the fun out of your runs and strength sessions.
* The intra-week runs are not long enough. Only running 3 ‚Äì 7 miles for the two training runs made the long runs feel especially long.¬†
* Because the class caters to a broad audience, the music spans all genres. Normally, I would put this in the positive column, but there were multiple instances where I was at the peak of one of my runs and a song produced a head-banging dubstep drop that felt like it was going to rattle my brain inside my skull.

# Advice for undertaking the Road to 26.2 Program

* Run more miles intra-week. The tempo and marathon race prep runs range from 30 to 60 minutes, which for me meant 3 to 7 miles per run. Especially during parts 2 and 3, running these short distances during the week makes you feel inadequately prepared for your weekend long runs.¬†
* Run an organized half marathon in weeks 6-10. Not only does this reduce nerves for your marathon by giving you experience running in an organized race (where you will be surrounded by 100s of other people and following a predefined route), it also helps to prevent burnout by giving you something to be proud of in the midst of the program.¬†
* If nothing else, DO THE LONG RUNS. Increasing the distance of your long runs alone can get you to the finish line of a marathon, while the rest of the work helps to build strength, confidence, and prevent injury. But if you are going to skip a day or two in the program, do not skip the long runs ‚Äì they not only help to build key muscle fibers, they also help you strengthen your mental game to be capable of running for 4 hours straight.
* Spend the money to get a good pair of socks and shoes. I used a pair of beat up athletic shoes for the first 6 weeks until my joints could no longer take it. I finally got a pair of Hokas and all of a sudden I felt like I was gliding through my long runs.
* Program in cool down stretches after each run and throw some yoga into your training mix. I felt myself on the verge of injury at a couple points throughout the program, and think my yoga cross-training really helped me stay agile and able to take on increased strain.
* Force yourself to go for runs in tough conditions. I often waited out bad weather for my long runs or even rescheduled them for another day of the week. Come race day, when I was faced with pouring rain and 10-15mph headwinds, I was not a happy camper.

I hope this was helpful for those looking to start the program or those thinking about running their first marathon. Happy to answer any questions - and will add some of the Q&A to the article above.",2022-12-03 15:26:53+00:00,18,4

I don't know if it was the shoes, although they helped, or that our load went down because it was summer when I got them, but it went away. I bought another pair to keep on hand to rotate them. For over a year, I was good but then the faciitis came back. Honestly, it didn't go away again until I had PTO time in April and was also doing PFTs so a lot less walking.   


I still maintain that they are the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. I can't imagine going back to another shoe, but, has anyone else had the Bondi and another shoe that is comparable? I really need to get something new just because mine are wearing out. My newest pair is over a year old (although I do rotate wearing them).",2022-10-30 19:51:46+00:00,4,7
yf6so8,CaminoDeSantiago,My bag weighed under 3kg and I overpacked. Gear thoughts after back-to-back Caminos.,"On September 19 I began the Camino Portugues. After I finished I learned more about the Camino Primitivo, and decided to do that as well. I got a lot of questions about my gear, being the smallest pack anyone had seen on trail, so I thought I'd post my pack list and some thoughts from both trips. 

**Camino Portugues**

[Portugues Packing List](https://lighterpack.com/r/jyw25s)

I hike regularly, so my pack list for this trip was really just distilling what I usually take on a backpacking trip out in the woods down to just the essentials I would need when I know I'll have regular access to clean water, food, and a bed. I posted a [shakedown request](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/xg80yb/camino_de_santiago_portuguese_route_shakedown/) over on /r/ultralight and received mostly bad advice about what to remove from my initial list. I hugely regret leaving my sleeping pad and headlamp, which saved a minimal amount of weight but made a huge difference when I added it on my next Camino.

The one good bit of advice I received was to have an extra set of clothes for going out. I decided to visit a Decathlon straight from the airport in Porto and picked up a collared tennis shirt (‚Ç¨8) and pants (‚Ç¨15) that I ended up switching into every day after I arrived to the albergue and showered. It added a substantial 11.6 oz (330g) to my pack, but I liked my ""town clothes"" so much that I'm contemplating adding them to future thru-hikes. 

The one piece of gear I became known for was my umbrella. I **loved** my umbrella, and used it every single day. It was in the 80s (25+C) and sunny for most of this trip, and I was enjoying the shade while everyone else was struggling. I had a clip attachment so it mostly sat on my shoulder, and the whole thing weighed 7oz (200g). When combined with my $1 Walmart poncho (1oz/30g) I was much drier than everyone else during the one day where it rained, and I could use my phone and eat snacks without fear of it getting wet.

The other major surprise was how well my [$10 backpack](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073RZPTK6) worked out. I bought this last minute when I realized the $250 custom-tailored [KS Ultralight](https://www.ks-ultralightgear.com) pack I was intending to use would not arrive on time (it arrived a few days after I left). I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the construction of the $10 bag, with taped seams, and the same 30D Cordura fabric used on much more expensive ultralight bags. The bag weighs only 4oz (113g). Unfortunately the company has since gone out of business, so the bag is not currently available for purchase. 

The thing I regret most about this trip was my choice of footwear. I decided on the same trail runners I regularly use on the trail, where they work amazingly well, not realizing how much pavement and cobblestones I'd be walking through. Though I have never gotten a blister in hundreds of miles of hiking through 26 national parks in the last year, I got two of them after the second day and I was dreading every step over cobblestone streets. I very much wish I had gotten HOKA Speedgoats, which were not in stock in my size at the time so I went with my minimalist Topos instead. I highly recommend going with a shoe that has an ample amount of cushion; everyone wearing HOKAs was loving life and I joked about stealing their shoes in the night. 

I also didn't use any of my cold weather gear at all on this Camino, but I knew I probably wouldn't. I had been flown to Europe for a work convention in Germany, and packed it mainly for that, but even then I could have definitely done without the Merino wool shirt and fleece midlayer (which not only rarely got used, but also caused me to bus back to Tui to retrieve). I could have just brought my puffy and been good. 

I never used my jar to actually [cold soak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vLzwWUQ9_g) anything, because there was nothing at any store that I could cold soak (couscous, instant rice, noodles, or oatmeal, etc). I did use it to microwave food, and I used it as a measuring cup a couple times. For the most part though it didn't really serve its purpose on this trip. 

Lastly, I brought a way too big towel (my second heaviest item after my sleeping bag) with the expectation that I would use it as a beach towel or bed sheet, but I ended up doing neither. 

**Camino Primitivo**

[Primitivo Packing List](https://lighterpack.com/r/bxawi2)

For this Camino I decided restock the items I had lost (a pair of underwear, socks, and my hat) and add items I wish I had brought with me previously (trekking poles, sleeping pad, headlamp, smaller towel). 

For the underwear I went with a cheap pair from Decathlon, for the socks I decided to go with [CoolMax toe socks](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093F99LWM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) to help with blister prevention. Though I never got another blister after that second day, I wanted to make sure it stayed that way on the much tougher Primitivo. For my hat I decided to go with a cheap ‚Ç¨4 hiking cap from Decathlon, which I ended up wearing all the time because it didn't look as goofy as my safari hat but it also didn't block the sun anywhere near as well. And I got a cheap ‚Ç¨4 Decathlon towel (4oz/90g) to replace my too big one.

For trekking poles I ordered Fizan Compact poles (5oz/158g) that I'm used to rather than the ubiquitous garbage ‚Ç¨5 Decathlon poles everyone carries. These ended up as lost luggage when I tried to check them on the way back home, but even if I never see them again I think they were worth the extra investment. I also went with the tried and true Nitecore NU25 for my headlamp. 

I bought a Decathlon sleeping pad (7oz/200g) which proved to be the most versatile bit of kit I carried. I never ended up using it for its intended purpose (which I regret, I wish I had camped out along the Hospitales) but I did use it every day. When I would first arrive to the albergue I would roll it out and [spread all my stuff on it](https://i.imgur.com/6AZsY0w.jpg). This would keep my stuff off the dirty floor, but also allow me to easily slide it underneath my bed out of the way, and I could drag it out in the morning without disturbing anyone. I also used it every morning to do yoga, which was a *game changer*. I had been doing the usual stretches before this, but yoga was amazing for my hips and back and shoulders and all those areas that you don't realize need some love. And occasionally I used it for [siestas](https://i.imgur.com/7rKCVUf.jpg). 

I contemplated switching to HOKAs, but I thought the Primitivo would be a lot more trail and a lot less pavement and it wasn't worth the hassle. Though this was mostly true, I still very much missed having more cushion.

The only other things I regret were not bringing more [AquaClips](https://www.aquaclip.com); these were amazingly useful to hang off my bag or belt loops or anything but also I was constantly leaving my water bottles behind and on more than one occasion had to go back for them (even dug through more than one trash can). They're only $3 each and light enough that I should have brought spares. And bringing more bungee ties, which I used for my umbrella, tying my poles together, etc. 

Once again, I rarely ever used my Merino wool shirt or my fleece midlayer. I think I wore them both once (for like an hour on the Hospitales when it was the coldest/windiest). I could have done fine with just my puffy and saved myself 10oz (285g). I was surprised by how often I just needed my very thin and lightweight sun hoodie. Even down to the 50s (10C) I was totally fine with just my sun hoodie. I would put on my shirt or midlayer and inevitably take it off less than an hour later. As long as I was walking, I never felt cold (outside of a brief period during the Hospitales). I also bought a cheap pair of fleece gloves that I never used, though thankfully it was only 0.7oz/20g so the weight was negligible. 

Oh, and I never used my earplugs either. They're uncomfortable to sleep with and it didn't really help me. This is another reason why I wish I had slept outside more. I definitely wanted the social experience of staying at albergues, but I think I could have just hung out for a bit and then kept walking and slept outside more. I could have enjoyed some nice sunset walks and still gotten to hang out with folks.

Well, that's about it. I hope this helps someone. I'm happy to answer any questions. Buen Camino!

The ball of foot would hurt and toe would go numb, one day my toe didn't really wake up completely and the ball of my foot was on FIRE. I went to podiatrist (what a joke), all he said was my right foot is c shaped and weird, gave me a cortisone shot, said to wear brooks or hoka and tried to sell me off of the shelf inserts. 

Off and on agony for a year and a half that is sometimes controllable. I end up starting to walk and slightly run trails in late 2020 off and on. Foot gets irritated, I buy more brooks shoes, foot still goes through phases of being unable to walk in a store very far. 

Last year I try another podiatrist who did an x ray, said sesamoid bones look good and tried to sell me off the shelf inserts. No other ideas of help other than he made a pad to try for a day to offload it. I later bought dedicated brooks trail shoes and go through the typical phases of agony vs being somewhat okay. Now in the last few weeks it has been major agony. Standing at work sucks, the gym sucks, everything sucks. I go back to the podiatrist last week and  pulls up my x-rays from last year and says my sesamoid bones are lined up perfect, he doubts they have changed any, and sold me their off-the-shelf inserts to try. 


Still in agony, what is the move now? Ortho? None can get me in. Walking boot? Stem cells?

y1qba2,XXRunning,Post Update: Running a Marathon with Little/No Training,"A few weeks I had posted a question about running a marathon without training and responses were a bit of a mixed bag. It‚Äôs not to say I didn‚Äôt have a high volume of running (50+ MPW), but I hadn‚Äôt ran more than 10 miles in one go since my last half marathon in October 2021. 

Well, I went through with it. I did a slight taper the week of (about 3 or so 5ks) and ate a little more/more carbs/less ‚Äúrestrictive‚Äù than usual.  I somewhat practiced my nutrition and made sure I was hydrating. Spent a lot of time trying to figure out what shoes to wear (last year‚Äôs racing Nikes, some pretty comfy Hoka carbons, or the Mach 5s I use on an everyday basis). I ended up wearing my old racing shoes even though I didn‚Äôt care about speed‚Äî it was more about what I could stay on my feet long without hurting. 

Morning of I was in a pretty good mood. I had no pressure, no time goal, just wanted to finish without injuries or crapping myself (history of GI issues‚Äî brought extra pads and wore period undies). Had some electrolytes and caffeine and pumped my playlist. Husband was a little more nervous because he had a time goal and was training smartly. 

Used the portapotty a few times to make sure I was as ‚Äúcleaned out‚Äù as possible. Decided to start with the 5hr crowd. Once we started I was in my head‚Äî don‚Äôt worry about anyone else‚Äôs pace, who cares where the pacer is, why did I put this song on my playlist, etc etc. I also programmed my Garmin for pace alerts and paid attention not to bring my HR above 140 for the first 20 or so miles. 

I used UCAN as a recommendation from here. Wasn‚Äôt as difficult to consume while jogging as I thought it would be. Maybe having more nutrition during the race would have helped with performance but I never felt sluggish or too tired. 

Once I passed 13 miles I thought ‚Äúwell this is already a distance PR, be proud!‚Äù I was having a great time! I danced to my favorite songs, cheesed it up for all the cameras, high fived the cheering crowd, it was awesome!

Only had to walk/stop for the bathroom and water stops. My usual weak areas (Plantar, knee, and Achilles) didn‚Äôt act up at all! Did smack my hip a few times‚Ä¶ I finished at about 4:40; and now I know what to aim for the next time. The last 1/2 mile or so I decided to push it since I still had juice in the tank. 

When people say it‚Äôs mostly mental, it‚Äôs true. I felt determined because I had overcome a lot of things since last year‚Äôs half. 

Thank you to this subreddit for the advice, opinions, and support. I think I had a great time and one I‚Äôll never forget. Yeah, my hips and butt were a bit sore‚Äî 2 days post race I can finally walk straight again lol.",2022-10-12 01:24:44+00:00,146,15

So as above states, my right foot is bigger than my left foot so with all shoes, my left shoe is slightly larger to accommodate my large right foot.

I‚Äôve recently bought some awesome Hoka hiking boots which feel great, however as always, the right boot fits snug and perfect while the left is slightly larger. 

No shop would let me have 2 different sizes boots as a pair.

Does anyone have any ideas to somehow make my left boot smaller? I‚Äôve tried double socks on the left foot but that makes it to hot, I‚Äôve always tried putting 2 insoles into the left boot and that makes walking feel weird as they both have different sponge/impact heights.

xir8w5,Shoes,"Need a sneaker that has zero arch support and preferably no arch cutout, and some other wants","I'm coming from the Hoka Clifton 7s, which have a sole that looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/NEkr2r2.jpg).  I'm wondering what out there has something that's even more extreme with how little the shoe comes in from toe box to mid-foot.  I also wouldn't mind something with a similar shape but in a wide size.  The Clifton 8 is on my radar, as are the Kaha 2 GTX boots and a couple others.  Any sort of arch support or hard plastic guides for overpronation is a definite no-no.

My wants are more picky but I can sacrifice them for function.  I'm hoping for something that's mainly black, or that has a  good few color options to choose from.  I greatly prefer mid- or even high-tops to low-tops, but it feels like all the shoes that fit my needs end up being low-top running shoes.  Cushioning is nice, but definitely not a need.

xbk0y5,AskDocs,Orthopedic dr. doesn't want to give prescription for ExoSym,"I suffered a trimalleolar fracture almost 5 months ago and am still recovering, but felt incredibly hopeless knowing that my risk of arthritis is high due to trauma, and upon arthroscopy, there was already partial depth cartilage damage. As a young, active person who loves travelling, dance, taking my dog on long walks, the occasional run, and hikes, I was absolutely devastated.

Enter ExoSym, a type of AFO. It gave me hope of returning to more high impact work outs and prolonging the time I'm pain and arthritis free by wearing it part time only for specific activities. It's private pay and carries a high price tag, but in my view, the benefits of being a part time user still outweigh the cost, and I have the money. I've been going to PT and doing the rehab exercises religiously and plan to continue doing so.  Yet when I asked my doctor for a prescription via his secretary, the answer came back as a firm ""No.""   (the prescription is required by WA state). I've also experienced pain in the big toe/metatarsal area from previously asymptomatic bunion which is now incredibly angry, and was looking forward to having some 'down time"" as this seems to help the pain in this area.

**Could anyone tell me what may help sway my doctor to a ""Yes""? I have an upcoming appointment to see him this month and want to plead my case. Any advice appreciated, even if it's to explain why the answer is ""No.""**

**TLDR: I'm well aware I don't require an AFO, but am desperate to maintain as much joint and cartilage function as possible for as long as possible due to my age and activity levels.**

PS: I've already taken other measures to reduce pain and support the joint. I wear wide width Hokas (supportive shoes) and found that lacing using a heel lock helps some of the big toe pain. I use diclofenac topical and topical CBD for pain relief, but it's not enough. I'm still not walking correctly due to big toe pain...the push off phase just hurts too much. I have about 10 degrees of dorsiflexion, and my PT thinks my ankle flexibility previously helped me walk more on the outsides of my foot and thus avoid big toe pain. Old shoe wear patterns show wear on outsides. I'm aware that I'm still early in recovery for an ankle fracture, and that I'll see final result in 9 months to a year.

I would love to get recommendations for shoes that accommodate feet with high arches and that are prone to supination. Alternatively, do any of you use orthotics in your hiking shoes? If so, can you share a little about your experience?

For reference, Hokas and Adidas absolutely do not work for me ‚Äî the lack of support is outright painful and unbearable after about 10 minutes. I just bought a pair of Kurus for gym sessions and have high hopes after 40 minutes on the treadmill with them, but I‚Äôd like to find a more substantial shoe option for outdoor activities before my hiking season really kicks off.

HELP!  I need a comfy shoe/s either for work, for gym (mostly strength training, but I do jog for a few minutes each time) and for day-to-day life wear!

I have quite a few feet, knee, and issues with my lower body in general. I‚Äôve listed them below:

-I naturally I underpronate/or my feet angle outwards when walking
-knee surgery in may of 2022 because my knee cap kept popping out from minimal to no activity
-arch pain
-have had Metatarsalgia in past 
-gluteus medius/minimus and hip pain (I think from over compensating when walking because of my knee surgery)
-pain in arch after work, even though I usually sit most of the time (I DO WEAR ORTHOTICS MADE BY A PODIATRIST SO IM NOT SURE IF THAT IS THE CAUSE OR THE SHOES)

Since I wear orthotics I‚Äôm not sure if some of my issues are due to them not being completely ‚Äúbroken in yet‚Äù. But regardless, if it isn‚Äôt my orthotics, I need a shoe that is comfy and won‚Äôt make my feet hurt after being on them and walking awhile. And because of my orthotics, I need a shoe that won‚Äôt interact with the orthotics structure i think, if that makes sense, otherwise my orthotics and shoes don‚Äôt fit right. I also have narrow to normal feet, and want a secure fit but a slightly roomy toe box. So I guess normal toe box would be best or wider toe box.

THESE ARE SHOES I‚ÄôVE ALREADY LOOKED AT, PLEASE TELL ME IF YOU THINK THEY WOULD BE A GOOD FIT FOR WHAT IS LISTED ABOVE, IF MULTIPLE SHOES ARE GOOD FOR ME, OR FOR CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, PLEASE LET ME KNOW!!!

x1r8o3,bunions,Did wearing excessively tight shoes cause my bunions?,"Having recently had bunion surgery and being a person who enjoys learning lessons from life experiences, especially painful ones, I have started to research this topic and am startled to discover that while nobody has a definitive answer as to the cause, wearing shoes that are too tight is a long-standing causal hypothesis that has never been dismissed.

In my own case, I have gone from a size 10.5 sneaker to a size 12.5 Hoka and had never imagined that such a large size might actually be the ‚Äúcorrect fit‚Äù [per Fleet Feet].

Very happy now with recovery 10 weeks post bunion surgery. Sure wish someone had warned me of the importance of proper shoe fitting while I was a child.

wosm8z,AskDocs,Persistent Heel Pain After Achilles Tear Surgery and Recovery,"38M, 6‚Äô3‚Äù, 190lbs, heel pain after Achilles repair, 4+ months. Athletic and reasonably fit before Achilles rupture, regular bike riding and spin before and limited amount in the past month or so (close to 6-months post surgery), no smoking, infrequent social drinking but very little since surgery, no recreational drugs. 

I had a complete Achilles‚Äô tendon rupture in March of this year. I had surgery four days later and the recovery of the Achilles itself has been uneventful and on schedule.

I got my boot off after 6 weeks post-surgery. I had very little muscle tone in that calf and ended up walking around semi peg-legged with probably excessive weight and impact on my heel due to the lack of muscle. About two weeks after that I started to have relatively severe pain in my heel. It felt like there were rocks in my shoe under my heel, but this feeling would be there without shoes on. The harder the surface the worse the feeling.

Around this time I hunted around for shoes that would lessen the impact on my heel as well as inserts that would cup the heel and ensure proper arch support. I tried lots of shoes and ended up with some Hokas along with Superfeet inserts that decrease the pain during normal walking and decrease my heel impact when walking. 

At 5 months post-surgery. My Achilles recovery and physical therapy have proceeded without issue and I‚Äôve come a long way to rebuilding my calf strength. I can now walk normally and without a limp (when my heel isn‚Äôt hurting too much to make me limp). And yet, the heel issue persists.

I went back to my orthopedic surgeon as well as a podiatrist, both of which were stumped. The podiatrist gave me a powerful anti-inflammatory to use for 6 days and was 100% sure that would knock it out, and if not, that it would go away on its own. He scheduled me for a 6-week follow up, although he was 100% sure I wouldn‚Äôt need it. The anti-inflammatory did nothing to improve the issue.

I finally got an MRI on the heel which shows that the Achilles is recovering but my heel has edema underneath. The MRI shows no plantar fasciitis or related issues. The edema is under the heel itself on the left and right sides. 

After seeing the MRI, my surgeon suggested trying 600mg of Ibuprofen every 6 hours as well as icing (which I‚Äôve since tried with little to no improvement) but was otherwise suggesting putting my back in the boot for a few weeks to see if that helps. I desperately do not want to reset my recovery as the muscle rebuilding on the calf has been a long, slow, and painful process. So I‚Äôm looking for any other ideas or perspectives. Anything would be helpful. 

TLDR: Edema under my heel started during Achilles surgery recovery. Now persisted for 4+ months. Looking for thoughts and advice.",2022-08-15 06:46:59+00:00,2,3
wnvz0b,AskDocs,Is omitting medical & billing records for a medical appt legal or is my doctor covering her tracks?,"24F plus size gal in CA. I have had 2 flat foot ankle reconstructions on the same R foot within 8 months. I have multiple questions that range in general to niche (1st two questions). Any help is greatly appreciated! Even an answer to 1 questions will really help.

1. I would like to know what the standard level of care/procedure is for the repair of a posterior tibial tendon. 

2. If that standard procedure is an FDL tendon transfer, what is the standard level of care/procedure for that specific treatment. ( I would like to be able to compare the standard with what was written in my surgical operative report and then compare that to what actually happened for my 1st surgery) 

3. In CA, I had my 1st surgery in a surgery center and I had been told by my PA that I needed to be a certain weight. I never reached that weight but surely died trying. The doctor office and surgery center both had me weighing on their scales as 20 ibs less than what I actually weighed. This allowed me to move forward with the 1st surgery in the surgery center instead of the hospital. Is this common, has anyone ever heard of this? 

4. Post surgery when I knew I wasn‚Äôt healing I made an appt with my surgeon. This was a particularly bad appt. Blamed me not healing on not having Hokas, being overweight, and having a low pain tolerance level. I have a journal entry of this appt incld the exact date/time. The medical record & billing record for this appt does not exist. How illegal is it to omit appts? Especially bad ones? 

5. For CA, is there a cap on how much a doctors office can charge for medical records? What if I had to drive to the location3 separate times because I paid for the full medical record but they did not include physical therapy records, billing records, imaging etc‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. 

6. I have a surgical operation report that I would like to have broken down so I can confirm that a procedure was not actually done that was said was done. Does anyone have any resources that would allow me to have this translated for free or low cost?",2022-08-14 03:08:32+00:00,0,1

wmup4k,sesamoid,Sesamoid fracture - Any advice would be appreciated,"Hi everyone! I found this group today, which I am very happy about, because I have not read any useful information about sesamoid fracture anywhere else. So I would now like to share with you my story, which has not been so lucky so far. For starters, you should know that I live in Hungary and unfortunately the health care  system here is not very up to date.

So, exactly 8 weeks ago, I hurt my left ankle as a result of a fall down the stairs. Because of this, I had an X-ray, which showed that there was no fracture in my ankle, but they did notice that there was a fracture in the sesamoid bone, which had presumably been there for some time. I found it odd because apart from a minimal pain I felt sometimes, mainly after sport, I have never felt anything. It wasn't swollen either and it didn't affect my walking. As a solution, the doctor put me in a non-weight-bearing cast for 2 weeks and since then I have been in a walking boot. 

At the 6 week check up, the new x-ray showed no improvement. Despite this, the doctor told me to start slowly getting used to walking normally again in stiff soled shoes. Only if I have a problem, I should go back to another check up. That's all. Nothing more. No physical therapy, no new X-rays, nothing. 

Then I went to another doctor who basically suggested the same thing, with the addition that they would take a new X-ray in 2 months but that I should not walk barefoot until then. It usually takes 12 weeks to see new bone. 

After this visit, unexpectedly, my affected toe completely swelled and started to hurt. I don't know why, because I did nothing irregular.

Eventually, I decided to go to a private physiotherapist, who told me that she thinks  I should just avoid wearing high heeled shoes and that with lots of PT the fracture would improve over time, I should be patient. Since seeing her I have been doing the exercises every day, multiple times, and my toe has indeed improved. 

This is where I am now.

Also, since nobody could tell me exactly what type of shoe is the best for this, I only have regular sneakers which I believe are not right for now. Reading previous posts on this subreddit I found suggestions for Hoka/Brooks shoes and Hoka/Teva/Crocs slippers. 

Do you think I can start walking in these despite the fact that the last x-ray showed no improvement of the fracture?

wj7907,XXRunning,Shoe Recommendations,"Hi everyone! I have recently been trying to find the right shoe for me without much success. I would appreciate anyone‚Äôs feedback on shoe recommendations!

I started running about 3 years ago in Hoka One Bondis. For someone starting out they had a great amount of cushion, but after my first half marathon this year I started wanting more support. They also didn‚Äôt seem to fit my feet very securely.

In June I went to a local running store and had my feet scanned. I apparently have very narrow feet with high arches, so it explained why the wider Hokas didn‚Äôt fit correctly. They recommended either ASICS Gel Nimbus 24 or On Cloudswifts. I liked both when I tried them on, but I had heard mixed reviews about ON shoes so I went with the ASICS. 

I have been running in the ASICS for about 2 months now. I still like how they fit on my feet, but I‚Äôve been dealing with more leg/ankle pain ever since switching at the same mileage I used to run (20-25 mpw). I don‚Äôt want to swap back to Hokas. I am wondering if the higher drop of the Gel Nimbus (13 mm) vs. Hoka Bondis (4 mm) was too much of a change for me. It looks like the On Cloudswifts have a drop of 6 mm so maybe they could work better for me. 

Does anyone have any advice for what I should do next? I‚Äôm considering getting some On Cloudswifts to try, so I‚Äôd also appreciate any reviews on those as well!

Edit in case anyone finds this in the future: thanks for all of these suggestions! After doing some more research I tried a few more shoes - On CloudMonster, Saucony Endorphin Shift, Nike Invincible, and (starting today) Hoka Cliftons. I tried on Brooks Ghosts in store and I didn‚Äôt love the feel of them.

The On Clouds felt nice but gave me blisters, so I removed those from the rotation. I have been rotating through the Shifts and Invincibles for the last few weeks and have been enjoying them! After reading some more reviews I decided to give Hokas another chance and bought the Cliftons. I used them for a 5 mile run tonight and they felt great!

wgccfo,sesamoid,22F. I've had a nearly 2 year journey with my (repeat) sesamoid fracture that is shaping up to finally come to a close soon. I want to offer some hope. Here's what's worked for me! (I've finally got the right team around me!),"*I think it is possible to avoid surgery, even if it takes years! My PT has shared stories of people who have had more intense sesamoid/biomechanical issues than I do, and who with patience have managed to heal and avoid surgery, albeit over a handful of years! Based on my doctor's advice (I can talk more about his experience), I BELIEVE YOU SHOULD AVOID SURGERY IF YOU CAN, ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE YOUNG.*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Sesamoid injuries are depressing as hell. Frankly, mine still is depressing, considering the fact that people with sesamoid injuries are statistically more likely to have a repeat fracture in the future‚Äîboth in their affected foot and in their unaffected foot on the other side (the reasons for the increased likelihood are varied). I'll probably have to be careful with myself and my feet for the rest of my life to prevent yet another repeat fracture. I might have to give up some things (fingers crossed).

But now, I have a LOT more certainty about how to tackle this godforsaken injury‚ÄîI have a lot of hope that this injury is manageable.

After experiencing a sesamoid fracture in high school that was relatively easy to heal for whatever reason, I was complacent‚Äîat that time, my injury didn't seem to require me to find a complex solution with a team of actually talented medical professionals around me to tackle the issue.

This time around, my injury has been a lot worse and a lot more complicated. Luckily, over the last year I've found solutions and doctors/physical therapists that really work for me. It's been a long process, and being injured for this long has profoundly sucked (to say the least), but I want to pass around the knowledge I've gained; if I'd had it sooner, I probably could've sped up my recovery from the get go. I feel really obligated to give back knowledge about this injury because I really do believe that the internet's collective knowledge can be empowering and more useful than doctors, IF the ones you're dealing with are incompetent. I've been lucky enough to find the right medical professionals now, and I want to give back to you all in the sesamoid injury community‚Äîwe're all so disheartened!

ABOUT MY INJURY: back when this repeat fracture started (1.5-ish years ago), it was just a sesamoid bone fracture. The innermost of the two sesamoid bones. Straight down the middle. Since the fracture was healing so slowly, it got more complicated. I compensated for the pain in my gait, which started fucking up other things. I developed tendonitis, then tendonosis, in the muscle that runs along my big toe, over my sesamoid, and into my arch. My arch(es) got really tight. My calves always have been really tight (which I've learned probably contributed to the injury, and prevented the healing of the injury), but they ironically got even more irritated due to the compensation. I got tendonitis in my knee (on the affected side). My other foot's sesamoid started to hurt.

**VERY, VERY BRIEFLY, HERE'S WHAT'S WORKING FOR ME (*****ALL BASED IN MY DOCTORS' ANALYSES AND ADVICE)*****:**

*FIRST OF ALL, BIOMECHANICS:* Figuring out the biomechanical root of the problem. 1) Tight calves cause me to distribute weight more on the ball of my foot (it makes sense if you think about it). 2) My affected-side big toe doesn't naturally touch the ground in resting position, leading me to pronate my foot inward to help it touch the ground and allow it to toe off the ground when walking, placing more pressure on the sesamoid. 3) My affected-side big toe is fairly turned inward (bunion), more than my other big toe, also placing more pressure on the sesamoid.

**SOLUTIONS:**

* Hokas AT ALL TIMES (I realized over time that (wide) Bondis actually work markedly better for me than the other models). Also, Teva ""Mush"" flip flops/sandals are game changing (they're so soft) and I switch them out with my Hokas sometimes.
* Don't focus too much on seeing a podiatrist, they're relatively useless (aside from prescribing the Exogen machine, see way below). Conversely, find doctors you trust, even if it takes a bit of searching. Pedigree is NOT EVERYTHING (!!!!!!!), but it does comfort me that my orthopedic doctor went to Harvard.
* Custom orthotics from my physical therapist's office, NOT my podiatrist's office (designed from one-on-one analysis from a gait-specialist physical therapist); firm arch support, soft sesamoid/toe box area, and a couple degrees of lift to help the toe that doesn't naturally touch the ground in resting position (basically making the toe meet the surface with extra material) \*\*If not custom orthotics, Dr. Scholls GEL inserts actually work really well. I put them in my second pair of Hokas. Super soft.
* Dry needling both my calves consistently (and finding someone who I feel comfortable with doing it, who listens to my needs and fears!) ‚Äî every couple days was necessary at first, but now I do it biweekly or so. There's a trigger point in the top of the foot between the big toe and second toe that also is super helpful for me‚Äîmy second PT suggested it, not my first, which speaks to the fact that every PT is different and it may be worth trying out a couple! I also like better how my second PT dry needles as compared to my first PT (but I only got a new one because I moved).
* Hydrodissection of my calves and arches: this is a cutting edge regenerative medicine therapy that basically manually releases thick fascia and muscle tightness with a saline solution. It has a similar effect to dry needling but I've found the relief lasts longer and it's a different process of releasing tension. It also is comforting to me that it's ultrasound guided‚Äîthe doctor can intentionally avoid visible nerves and blood vessels.
* PRP! I've had PRP 3 times, and it's 100% helped my fracture progress and avoid surgery. It is also a cutting edge regenerative medicine therapy. Sadly it is very costly, but for me, I've been able to do it and I think it's SO worth it if you can afford it. Technically, studies focus on using PRP on tendons/ligaments and not bone, but there's some evidence of it working on bone and I know it's helped mine... to that end, I've also gotten PRP done on the tendonosis in my toe/arch area!
* A good regenerative medicine orthopedic specialist (he's done the PRP/hydrodissection).
* A good PT who dry needles/gait analyst.
* Stretching (though I don't do it as much as I should). Get a massage roller!!!!!!!
* Using my foot (i.e., walking) just enough to increase blood flow to the bone, but not so much as to damage it/prevent healing (this is advice from my orthopedic doctor). Sub-3,000 steps a day, especially at the beginning.
* ""Exogen"" bone simulator machine DAILY (prescribed by podiatrist)‚Äîit sends out a particular ultrasound frequency that has been shown to stimulate osteoplasts (bone cells) and their growth. \*\*There are restrictions about using the bone simulator around PRP.
* X-Rays AND at least one MRI.
* Temporary handicap placard!
* Cross-training so you don't mentally feel like shit as much as you otherwise would (had to learn this one the hard way, I still slack).
* Epsom salt baths.
* Arnica gel for pain (especially knee tendonitis pain).
* Tennis ball (or similar) to self-massage the arch of the foot.
* For my bunion (biomechanical partial root cause) issue, toe separators that you can get on Amazon.
* VITAMIN D and BONE SUPPLEMENTS! Vitamins are definitely key. Turns out I have a vitamin D deficiency (like a lot of people!), which can interact with how well you can absorb bone supplements, like calcium and magnesium (yes, magnesium helps bones, not just calcium).
* Use doctors who are clearly UP TO DATE ON RESEARCH. ",2022-08-04 21:10:00+00:00,36,22

Due to having weird feet, most trainers are quite painful, and I've mostly kept to ecco shoes (not even their walking shoe variants).  Towards the end of last year, I invested in some HOKAs, which resulted in me getting really painful feet that lasted for months (seems to have been plantar fascitis, but whatever).  

So, in the beginning of May I went to this specialty shoes store and they immediately noticed that my feet are rather wide.  They recommended some wider trainers, and it's been wonderful.  Only downside is that they're expensive ($200).  Best pair of shoes I ever had.

I'm in the PNW, lots of rocks, lots of water, lots of roots. I'm really tempted to get a pair of Hoka's as I hear a lot of good things, but I'm a little curious about how well they work out for folks considering they don't have that arch in the sole that can help with traction. Any suggestions? Trying to stick to waterproof stuff and not really into higher ankle shoes.

voxda2,AskDocs,Flat Feet + Arch Pain: what to do in meantime?,"I'm 25F, 5'6"" 115ish lbs, live in Canada. No smoking, drink rarely, no drugs. No meds, have asthma, have flat feet. This pain has been for the last couple weeks.

I have flat feet, from what I understand I was born with them. No injury or anything to cause a collapse. I've got by in life with little issue. I'm a rock climber so I stuff my feet into small, bent shoes day after day, I hike a ton, I've never had too much issue except foot cramps. 

Started a new serving job where I was 15km a shift on average (usually more on busy days). I'm on my feet 8-10 hours, it's hard. I started getting some intense arch pain, my (lack of) arches became so tight that I was getting nerve pain if my heel would lift. I was wearing converse so I bought a pair of Hokas yesterday to try and offer cushion and support, but I still have a lot of pain while walking (obviously it doesn't go away immediately but damn). 

I have the classic symptom.for plantar fasciitis of it hurts to even walk in the morning until I've walked a bit and loosened stuff up, but the pain is not in the heel. It's in the arch, typically on the inside edge of the arch, sometimes outside, and the top of the foot near the ankle (wraps around the foot to the ankle). 

Everything I've researched mentions heel pain as well as being overweight for plantar fasciitis so the symptoms best improve with losing weight. Well that's not an option for me as I'm already in shape. 

Should I continue doing the at home treatments (massage, rolling foot out, ice, stretching) for plantar fasciitis or is it possibly something different that may need different stuff? I can not find anything other than plantar fasciitis.

vmkevo,Shoes,Best and most comfortable shoes (for music festivals especially),"Hello shoe enthusiasts,

I'm looking for the best/most comfy shoes, especially for music festivals. Good for wearing for many hours, walking a lot, dancing, comfortable with good cushioning, possibly breathable. I've already searched and found some options but I'm asking with some more details.

Many people suggest Adidas Ultraboost (mostly on Reddit). In fact, I own one but it got too worn out, plus it is kinda not the most comfy shoes from the sides. I also have an old Nike Free Run which is more comfortable, although has less cushioning. I don't want to spend for Adidas and Nike again just to wear out in festivals.

Some other suggestions are trail running shoes or hiking shoes but I never owned one. I don't know if you have any recommendations. One popular suggestion was ""Hoka"" brand. Some suggested waterproof options but they might not be breathable.

I almost decided to buy a Sketchers model but I couldn't decide on the model because there are so many options with different cushioning, ultra light weight, arch support, waterpoof etc. For example, There are GOrun models but I don't know if it is the best option. What Sketchers model do you recommend?

uz3i0q,sesamoid,Unorthodox Advice/My Experience,"There's a lot of posts on this sub where folks are seeking advice to mitigate their pain after months of staying off the affected foot and other treatments fail to make a difference. 

I am by no means an orthopedic expert, but I feel compelled to share what has worked for me. 

I'm 22 and fractured my sesamoid two years ago. As with everyone else, I spent months in a boot, avoided bare feet, drastically reduced high-impact cardio, etc. None of it helped. In fact, the foot was worse after treating it so delicately, and my unaffected foot was compensating for the other, leading to pain in both feet. 

Due to necessity (military service) 1.5 years ago, I had to start training again as I once did. Now, while I still have some mild basal pain which persists, I live the same as I did before the injury, and in my opinion, the physical and mental health benefits of a normal exercise regime outweigh the annoyance of the pain. 

Here's what I found helps: 

* Carefully, but deliberately train on your feet. Not medical advice, but in my anecdotal experience, my feet adapted to the broken sesamoid and the pain reduced dramatically after a few months (could be psychological?). 
* Avoid foods that cause inflammation. There is a noticeable difference in pain on days when I am not consuming a balanced diet (a weekend of boozing and fast food for example). 
* When doing high impact exercise like running, use footwear that's cushioned and/or has inserts that work well with you. You can never go wrong with hokas. I do weighted long distance runs in both hokas and boots and do experience some pain after, but it's manageable. 
* When training on your feet (squats for example) be deliberate about using proper form even if it means putting pressure on the sesamoid. Otherwise, you will get more pain in other areas of the foot as they compensate. When you start doing this, **go easy** at first, so as to progressively adapt the sesamoid back into use. 
* Suck it up. By all means, listen to your body, but sometimes you draw the bad card and sucky things happen to you. In an ideal world, we never would have been injured, but here we are, so may as well make the best of it and hit the ground running (literally). 

Hope this gives some hope those who are suffering from this injury!",2022-05-27 17:38:09+00:00,12,7

u6oa0m,FootFunction,Help overcoming neuromas,"I have been dealing with foot pain for about 8 months now, which has become completely debilitating.  It started as mild pain and tightness in my achilles area.  A few weeks later while walking, I felt a sharp pain in the bottom of my second toe like I was standing on a rock. I could barely make it home. The doctor diagnosed it as metatarsalgia and capsulitis. I have since tried met pads, custom orthotics, correct toes, various shoes (new balance 880 and Hoka Bondi), and PT.  None of this has provided more than very temporary relief.

I recently had an MRI and was diagnosed with two neuromas in the right foot, edema in every toe on both feet, and edema in the left sesamoid.  I think I occasionally feel neuroma pain in the left foot too despite it not showing up on the test.

About me:  I am a male with very narrow feet (AA) and high arches.  My feet turn out (especially the right one).  Even though my right foot turns out, my right knee seems to want to collapse in.  I think I put extra pressure on the outside of my feet when I walk and stand.  I notice sometimes while standing that my ankles roll to the outside and my weight is on the outer toes.    

From reading this sub it seems my best hope for relief is to fix my gait and strength through kinstretch or other means?  I know there are people here who have found great success fixing their neuromas naturally, which is what I hope to do. I'm very new to all of this and I'm hoping for some advice on where to start - especially because my feet are still so sensitive and it has proven to be very easy to trigger a setback.  (Example: Sometimes I will try to push my sesamoid down towards the ground to even the weight between the inner and outer foot, and that can aggravate the neuroma area... Almost like doing this pulls the outer metatarsal heads together, despite me wearing toe spacers)

Are there particular coaches or joint-specific videos that you would recommend for my condition? Also, do you have any advice on how to pace myself so that I can avoid the serious week-long setbacks that so far seem too easy to trigger?

And lastly, how long should I realistically expect it to take before seeing improvement?  I don't want to get frustrated prematurely and seek out a shot or new inserts, etc, before giving this a full chance. 

Thank you all so much. I'm looking forward to seeing you on the other side :)

New Balances. When it fell asleep during my first few runs, I figured it was because the shoes were too narrow - my feet are a bit wide. I returned to the
running club store and exchanged them for some Hokas that were wides. They felt like a slight improvement, but ultimately haven't solved the
problem. I also purchased some recommended insoles after the running club employees assessed my gait. I've removed those and used the default
insoles today, thinking they may have created too much pressure, no improvement. I also ensure that I
don't tie my shoes too tight. Idk what more I can do! I'm an avid hiker and never struggled with such a
thing hiking miles on end in the mountains. As my title reads, it's always around 3 miles when it becomes more and more numb. Anyone been

tuod46,sesamoid,Sesamoiditis - what worked,"Having got a lot from reading peoples posts here - I thought I would share what actually worked for me. 

What worked

Hoka Gaviota (plush with late stage rocker)
Carbon plates in the Hokas
Custom orthotics
Oofos clogs (but only when pain free)
Contrast ice baths
‚ÄúInterval‚Äù increasing movement (see below) keeping pain below 2

What didn‚Äôt

Walker boots (see below)
Physio strengthening exercises
Ice packs

I have mixed feelings about the walker boots. Ultimately I got pain free using them and the custom orthotics but it was nearly 4 months of torture and once I had discovered the Hoka + carbon plate combination I think I could have achieved the same. I found managing pain coming out the boots quite challenging and I was very fearful of any pain. But Dr Blake‚Äôs blog was very good at describing the difference between good and bad pain and ultimately I tried to increase movement on every other day but keep the pain on the ‚Äúoff‚Äù day below 2/10.",2022-04-02 17:32:11+00:00,5,18
tqnb3v,hiking,Hiking shoe recommendations for foot pain?," My boyfriend and I have historically worn Salomon trail runners (Sense Ride 3 currently) for our day hikes (up to 20 miles), and they've been great. However, we've started backpacking recently, and he always develops foot pain sometime on day 2 or 3 of our hike. We suspect it must have something to do with the extra weight he's carrying (between 20-30 lbs), and as such, we're thinking about replacing his trail runners with some hiking shoes/boots that can help him carry that weight more easily.

Any recommendations? The pain seems to be dispersed generally throughout his feet, but his arches seem to hurt the most. He already uses the Superfeet green insoles; he tried the ones specifically for hiking and liked the regular green ones better. Should he go for more cushioning (e.g. Hokas)? Or should he go for a stiffer sole? Anything else we should consider? Thanks!",2022-03-29 00:22:22+00:00,1,4

tg5t8e,sesamoid,Just Venting,"I‚Äôm not seeking any advice and I really don‚Äôt want any,  I just want to vent to others who have/ are dealing with this. I could use some positive stories about your recovery because it seems so far off for me at this point. 

TLDR: I‚Äôve been dealing with sesamoid issues since June. I started seeing a dr about it in August and after months of rebuilding I‚Äôm now back to square one and am just pretty hopeless. 

In August I found out I fractured my lateral sesamoid and partially tore the ligament in my big toe. I started feeling pain the first week of June but put off seeking any treatment until August because I thought it was just inflammation and I was studying and just did not have the time and didn‚Äôt need to walk a ton during that period. So I was just on an ice pack for several hours a day hoping for the best. 

We‚Äôre now in March and I‚Äôm in worse pain than I was in August. I‚Äôm going for my second MRI because my orthopedic surgeon thinks I may have fractured the other sesamoid and is looking for a joint issue.

I‚Äôm just so done. I was in a place where I could walk up to 30 mins without pain if I was wearing my hokas and custom orthotics. This was after a couple months in a boot, cortisone, and slowly building back up walking time. I have followed all instructions from my ortho. However - I decided to walk on the treadmill with a slight incline 2-3 times and I undid 7 months of treatment. I‚Äôm back in the boot and my ortho told me to put my orthotic in the boot so that‚Äôs in there now. Walking in the boot is still painful. 

I just want my life back. I‚Äôm under 30 and I work at home. I can‚Äôt take walks. I can‚Äôt move without pain. I‚Äôm supposed to be getting engaged really soon and I know my lack of mobility is throwing off my boyfriend‚Äôs plans which seems trivial but it just sucks that this injury is even negatively  impacting a really happy thing for me. I have just started swimming and the hour I‚Äôm in the pool is great but it‚Äôs the pain I experience getting to and from the pool that makes it tough to look forward to. I‚Äôve been consistent because I‚Äôm just desperate to move but I miss all of the exercise I did pre-injury so much. 

There just doesn‚Äôt seem to be an end in sight at the moment. Hopefully my upcoming MRI will be helpful in some way. The idea that I know I will still be dealing with this a year from now is devastating.",2022-03-17 08:57:53+00:00,9,25
tezw8n,sesamoid,My sesamoid story ‚Äì seeking advice on next steps!,"Hi all, this is a long post but I‚Äôll try to put a TL;DR at the end!

In December 2019 I did running incline intervals on a treadmill (e.g., run for 1 minute at 4% incline/6.1 speed or 3%/6.7 or 2%/7.2 with a rest of 1 minute at 0%/6.1) for about 25 minutes. This wasn‚Äôt really anything out of the ordinary; I live in Wisconsin so I had already been doing mostly treadmill running for about two months at that point, and I often do speed or incline intervals on the treadmill. I didn‚Äôt feel any pain at the time. That night I woke up in the middle of the night with awful, throbbing pain in the ball of my left foot, directly below my big toe. It ached somewhat over the following few days but nothing too bad, and I took a week off from running. A week later I ran two miles outside with no pain, but the same exact thing happened again that night - waking up with throbbing pain. I went to my primary care doctor two days later and they took an x-ray but didn‚Äôt find anything and referred me to a podiatrist, who couldn‚Äôt get me in until a whole month later. So for the following few weeks I completely stopped running but still walked to and from work most days (which is about one mile each way), used the elliptical and stationary bike for cardio, and tried to elevate and ice my foot after exercising. For the most part I never really felt pain again, and in the week leading up to going to the podiatrist I ran a few times with no issue.

By the time I saw the podiatrist I was symptom-free. His immediate reaction when he saw my foot was that I have very high arches (which I honestly didn't even know). He prodded my foot a bit but nothing was painful, and he said I have good ankle and calf flexibility. That‚Äôs about all he did, and he recommended I get shoe inserts for arch support because when I was running, particularly on an incline, I was putting too much weight and pressure on the ball of my foot and the arch support would better distribute the load over the rest of my foot. He said if I did nothing to address the issue I could develop arthritis and bone spurs on the top of my foot. He recommended SOLE brand inserts and a couple particular shoes (I know a Hoka shoe was one of them).

Since I was 100% back to normal at that time I decided to write it off as a weird thing that happened and move on. I went back to running and working out like normal. Then at the end of May 2020 I went for a pretty normal \~3 mile run outdoors, it was a bit hilly but nothing crazy, and then that night the same thing happened to me - I woke up in the middle of the night with awful, throbbing pain in the ball of my left foot, but this time it was worse and was not improving. I went back to my PCP and basically demanded an MRI which I was able to get pretty quickly. The results of that were:

IMPRESSION:

Abnormal signal suggesting stress injury within the tibial sesamoid.

Technologist Note: first MTP quite possibly she developed capsulitis versus sesamoiditis.

FINDINGS:

There is abnormal hypointense T1 and hyperintense T2 signal within a bipartite tibial sesamoid suggestive of stress injury. Fibular sesamoid appears normal. Remaining marrow signal within the bony structures show no significant abnormality. Joint spaces are normal. No evidence of significant effusion or erosion. Myotendinous structures and ligamentous structures appear intact. Muscle signal and soft tissue signal appear normal.

After I got these results I asked to see a new podiatrist, one with more experience with younger people and people who exercise a lot (the first podiatrist I saw was pretty old and seemed to me like he mostly dealt with more elderly, frail patients). This new podiatrist said I had a stress fracture. He said I could be put in a boot, but since this was the early pandemic days and I was working from home and not going anywhere, we decided that was unnecessary and he gave me crutches to use and said to mostly just avoid putting any weight on my foot. That went on for a little over a month, and then I began to gradually start putting weight on my foot with a dancer‚Äôs pad directly taped to it with a sesamoid cut out. All throughout this time the most pain I had was in the first week or two after the first night of throbbing pain in May; after that I had very little pain, and I pretty much never had pain upon palpation of my foot.

Once I fully transitioned off the crutches I got custom orthotics which I wore for a bit but then kind of gave up on. I was not a fan of the place I went to. When I went to pick up the orthotics the person had actually completely forgotten that I needed the sesamoid part cut out, so he just took a knife to the orthotics and cut it out right there, which didn‚Äôt seem legitimate. Also it seemed like both orthotics were exactly the same when I‚Äôm pretty sure my arch is higher in my left foot, so it felt comfortable in my left foot but felt like it was digging into the arch in my right foot. I began only wearing the left orthotic, but then felt like it was affecting my gait so then I gave up altogether.

Then in February 2021 I began seeing a physical therapist. This was also partly because I‚Äôve dealt with chronic low back pain due to scoliosis for about 15 years. But I also wanted to strengthen my left side and make sure I didn‚Äôt have muscle imbalances. Throughout this time (August 2020-Feb 2021) I was gradually getting back into walking, weightlifting, and biking, but nothing with jumping or running. I also did a lot of Caroline Jordan YouTube video chair workouts and other low impact video workouts to try and get some cardio. I would occasionally feel a little pain in my foot but nothing significant. After a few PT visits we decided to try and slowly incorporate some more impactful exercise. I began to incorporate some jumping into my workouts (like jumping jacks, etc.), and then I started to try running. In mid-April I tried running 1 minute, then walking 5 minutes, and repeating that 5 times, for a total of 30 minutes. That went fine, so my PT said once I complete that on three different days without any pain, I can then move up to 1:30 minutes running and 4:30 minutes walking, and so on. So that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing for almost the entire past year, usually running once per week.

I‚Äôm now up to 7 minutes running and 1 minute walking, repeated 4 times. I‚Äôve had some instances of pain over the past year, but nothing very significant. One of the worst I can remember is when I went on vacation to Maine last August. We went on two steep hikes in Acadia national park on the same day and that was actually completely fine. But then two days later we went on another steep hike and I started to get bad pain during that hike which really made me nervous (it ended up fine after a couple days). 

What has me nervous right now is I‚Äôve woken up a few times over the past week or two with a light throbbing pain. It usually only lasts like a minute or so, and actually seems to improve once I stretch and flex my foot out a bit. I‚Äôve also been getting a little pain in other random spots of both of my feet, like sometimes on the side beneath my pinky toe or in the middle of my feet. It gives me anxiety the bones in my feet are like disintegrating lol. I also find it so odd that for the most part I mostly only have pain in the middle of the night (I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever really had it while running), and it seems to improve when I move my foot around. It makes me think it could be something with a blood flow issue, like my sesamoid is not getting blood flow to it when I‚Äôm lying still and sleeping. I haven‚Äôt seen anything like that on this subreddit and I‚Äôve been lurking here for over a year so I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a real thing or what.

**So here is the TL;DR:**

I had my first sesamoid injury in December of 2019, it got better quickly so I ignored it and then reinjured it in May of 2020. I did not feel either injury happen; both times I experienced extreme throbbing pain in the ball of my foot in the middle of the night after a run the evening before. Got an MRI that confirmed sesamoid stress injury. Had crutches for a bit, and ever since then have slowly been getting back to normal activity. I had custom orthotics for a bit but gave up on them because I didn‚Äôt like them, but I wear dancer‚Äôs pads with the sesamoid cut out in most of my shoes. I‚Äôm back to doing pretty much everything now (weightlifting, biking, walking, HIIT high impact video workouts, volleyball) with the exception of running ‚Äì I‚Äôve VERY slowly been getting back to running over the past year and have gotten up to 7 minutes of running followed by 1 minute of walking repeated 4 times (total 28 minutes running). I‚Äôve lately been experiencing some light throbbing pain, along with some light pain in other areas of both of my feet. Since I‚Äôve made it this far I want to keep pushing, but I live in constant terror that my foot is going to get reinjured significantly and I never know what is going to set it off.

**Here's what I‚Äôd like advice on:**

1. Should I push to try and get another MRI? It‚Äôs been almost 2 years since my first and it might help to see if anything has actually worsened. Also I‚Äôve had multiple x-rays and those have never showed a single thing.

2. I have found my PCP, podiatrists, and physical therapist to be mostly unhelpful/unknowledgeable regarding my sesamoid injury. Should I try to see an orthopedic specialist? At this point it‚Äôs been almost a year since I‚Äôve seen anyone at all.

3. Since I‚Äôm able to do all my normal activities with the exception of running without pain, and since running has seemed to be what triggered this injury in the first place, should I consider just giving up running? I do love running and it‚Äôd hurt a lot to give it up but also I want to be able to use my feet for my remaining years (I‚Äôm 31).

Thanks to anyone who had read this all or who has any advice or commiseration to offer. This is an extremely shitty injury to deal with and it seems like no one knows how to help me. I often feel very scared and alone in this and I‚Äôm sure many of you can relate!",2022-03-15 20:46:00+00:00,5,9
tetk4w,sesamoid,MRI revealed patchy edema in both sesamoids on both feet. Now what?,"So yeah, been dealing with this pain for over 5 months now and while it has gotten better, any bit of walking that my sesamoids consider ""too much"" will set me back and require weeks of recovery to reduce the pain. 

Finally got an MRI and the result was the following:

**Mild patchy edema in the sesamoids at bilateral great toes and distal right metatarsal head. These findings are favoured to be related to disuse /altered biomechanics. No convincing imaging findings of sesamoiditis.**

What do I do with this information? I am wearing orthopedic shoes (Hoka Bondi) and this has helped me a lot, but other than that, should I be doing something else? I've been using Voltaren Extra Strength during flare-ups and icing when needed. Do I need crutches? It's in both feet so that could be problematic. Do I just wait this out?

I'm at a bit of a loss. Getting married in June and just hope I can be on my feet in dress shoes all day and not be in pain. Thanks everyone!",2022-03-15 16:56:42+00:00,2,9

What I have been recommended is a shoe with a stiffer mid-sole (my Altra superiors are super flexible at the forefoot) and a forefoot toe rocker which he thinks might negate the need for the Morton's plate if we feel this option is helping to reduce pain.

So I'm looking for a shoe with a minimal drop, wide toe box, stiff mid-sole and a forefoot rocker.

rfkhy1,FootFunction,Chronic foot pain - Looking for advice. Chronic plantar plate injury?,"Looking for advice. I have been dealing with chronic foot pain for the past 4 years and struggling to keep it together.

It started in 2017. I was trying be healthy, started doing a lot of yoga. I became fairly good at doing handstands, when I would finish I would always land on my right foot with my great toe hyperextended. I did this for a couple of months a few times a week. Never had an issue with it until August 2017. I went to Yellowstone and did some incline hiking in my minimalist shoes. Well at the end of the hike I was very uncomfortable on the ball of my great toe. I struggled for about 3-4 weeks. Wasn't working at the time so walked less and essentially limped (no push off on great toe) all of the time. I finally recovered, but decided to go to Florida around November. I was on the beach and during a push down all my symptoms returned. I was limping for 3 weeks with no improvement. Saw a Dr. who diagnosed me with hallux rigidus ( which is craziness, I was 27 at the time). Anyways really didn't offer much. Luckily I found hokas. Although I still had pain I could walk without a limp the moment I put on the new shoes. I saw another foot and ankle specialist who did imaging, MRI etc. We tried steroid injection into the joint and a wait and see approach with the hokas. I remember bringing up a plantar plate issue with him but he said I didn't have one because there was not instability. Eventually I ended up getting a medial sesamoidectomy due to possible non healing fracture seen on MRI. That was the end of 2018 and now certainly a regret. That did nothing for the pain. Since that time I have seen 3 other physicians all of which really didn't do or ask much other than saying they could lengthen my gastroc. Most recently I had another MRI performed which read as a possible small tear in the plantar plate of the first toe. The Dr. who ordered it was unimpressed and didn't recommend anything. Said I would probably just have chronic pain and to live in hokas. While I love the shoes (mostly bc I can walk normal) chronic pain with walking at 31 is pretty depressing. If I am not in hokas I limp, no push off on the great toe - which causes other ankle pain...

Has anyone dealt with an issue like this? A chronic plantar plate injury? I have not run, played a sport, been on a beach without shoes or worn a normal pair of shoes (without a mortons extension) for 4 years. I just had a baby girl and looking towards the future get slightly depressed, thinking that I will have to sit on the sideline during different experiences...Any thoughts are greatly appreciated.",2021-12-13 17:06:21+00:00,8,3

r2vrit,hiking,Best Trail running Shoes.,"Hello, had a question about some trial running shoes or versatile hiking shoes. 

Obviously there are the known brands for trail hiking shoes (La Sportiva , Solamon, Hoka etc) that are great shoes and you can pretty much find them everywhere . 

I‚Äôm trying to find the small niche companies that produce great products that no one (or in the US) is not generally known. As I do more research I‚Äôve dug up a lot of Companies based in Scandinavia (Kl√§ttermusen, Lundhags, Haglofs, J√∂ttnar etc) that provide extreme quality in my opinion. So I‚Äôm just asking if there are any Trail Running shoes or specific companies people would recommend taking a look at!

I‚Äôve had this pain for a year now. October 2020, I stubbed my pinky toe. Seemed fairly mild, no bruising or major swelling. But I have had constant and ongoing pain since then. The orthopedic doctor said he couldn‚Äôt believe those were the findings this far out from the injury.  

To fix it, he wants me to buy Hoka shoes and custom orthotics to take the load off of the 5th metatarsal head.   It just seems odd to me that buying a different pair of shoes would remedy the fracture. Should I get a second opinion?

I alternate between brooks and hokas (I‚Äôve learned I need to stick to good, supportive shoes and replace them often) the first week of September I started having a lot of pain in my right ankle/heel and under where the arch would be if I had one.  Podiatrist gave me a brace (later switched to a cam walker) and a night splint. No improvement with any of those. She sent me for a mri. Yesterday I posted because I had the images and was hoping someone could tell me what I‚Äôm looking at.

qpqxcx,AskDocs,Ongoing foot/ankle pain. Got mri today.,"Hello! 5‚Äô1‚Äô‚Äô 195 pounds 38 yr old female, non smoker/drinker, I‚Äôve had flat, rigid feet with over pronation for as long as I‚Äôve been alive. As I‚Äôve gotten older they‚Äôve been giving me more issues in the pain department but usually the problems go away pretty quickly with rest. I‚Äôve learned good supportive shoes are my friends and I alternate between brooks and hokas. I do work as a preschool teacher so I‚Äôm on my feet all day. 
The current problem started in the first week of September. Pain on the inner side of my right ankle, starts behind my ankle bone and extends down to where my arch would be (if I had one) some pain in the front of my ankle as well. As time has gone on I now have a burning sensation on the underside of my heel (literally feels like I‚Äôve got rug burn on my heel) that gets worse the more I‚Äôm on my feet.

I went to a podiatrist, she took X-rays and saw nothing ridiculous. She put me in a brace during the day and gave a night splint as well. Her thought was maybe a small stress fracture or post tibial tendinitis. When the pain was getting worse and the burning sensation started she switched me to a cam walker boot thing during the day. She sent me for a mri, I have the images but won‚Äôt have an appointment with her for 2 weeks. Do any medical professionals have any idea what might be causing this? Would you be willing to look at images from the mri to see if you could tell me what I‚Äôm looking at? Im not sure how to attach them on here but I‚Äôm sure I could send them in a pm?

qi1g8p,hiking,"Bruised toenails, hiking boots....I need some feedback....","I've had multiple (3) pairs of hiking shoes/boots that end up bruising the toe next to my big toe.  My most recent pair is the Hoka Kaha goretex, but this has happened with two other pair previously.  I hiked Sky Pond in June in Rocky Mountain with no problem.  I hiked Old Rag in Shenandoah last week and ruined my feet.  

So it bruises the toenail and it starts to throb and has now turned purple.  From my perception, I can tell I tend to lift that toe and bang it upon the top of the boot while walking uphill.  It is not from hitting the front of the boot so I don't feel like buying a larger size would help.  I had some success taping the toe to the next toe, but that just made things worse last week on Old Rag.  Seven blisters and two bruised toenails.  

I'm close to just starting to hike in running shoes.  I may need something with a soft top/upper.  Has anyone experienced anything similar with any feedback?  

I paid $220 for these boots at REI and most likely will take them back under their guarantee.  That's too much to pay for my feet to be ruined.",2021-10-29 01:22:12+00:00,7,27

I went to a podiatrist and after x-rays she said surgery is an option, but to first try getting Hoka shoes, and prescribed me Meloxicam. I pronate and wear orthotics so at least I don't need to have them made again.

TV is on and I see an ad for Lapiplasty. My doc apparently doesn't perform surgery using that product/technique.

ptkvob,AskDocs,Foot pain with new shoes," 

tldr: My new Merrell Moab 2 shoes are putting pressure/pain on the inside of my arch. What might be causing the pressure?

33M, 5' 7"", 170 lb., caucasian, foot pain (described in detail below), no other medical issues.

I just received a pair of Merrell Moab 2 that I ordered online recently. They were very comfortable when I put them on while sitting on the floor (plenty of room in the toe box, good length, etc). However, as soon as I stood up, I felt a quite noticeable pressure on the inside of my foot about halfway down lengthwise (right about in the middle of my arch). I felt this pressure before when looking for new running shoes (Hokas) which forced me to try a different brand. I have also been feeling the same pressure, albeit a lot less, in an older pair of combat boots that I wear on occasion.

Is anyone familiar with such a problem or change in foot structure? I'd be happy to try insoles, but I haven't the slightest clue which kind to try. Every search on Google comes back with foot pain in general, nothing about pressure while wearing the shoe.

For reference, I have a wide foot, medium-ish arches, am relatively athletic, and I pronate slightly (according to the gentleman at the running store).

Any info or guidance is greatly appreciated.",2021-09-23 01:44:40+00:00,1,1
pt8elj,XXRunning,Shoe Problems,"So, I'm looking for new running shoes and I am having a rough time. I need a wider toe box but I don't have wide feet, so I'm looking for a shoe that is wide enough so that my baby toes don't go numb but still narrow/supportive enough for my arches. I was running in Brooks Adrenaline GTS 20 but the new Adrenalines do not feel the same, so I'm trying to branch out. Here's what I've tried (as in, purchased and ran a few times in) so far:

Hoka Bondi 7 from the REI garage sale rack - always wanted to try Hoka, but I got numb toes. Will eBay these since I can't return.

Brooks Levitate GTS 5 - too narrow overall, numb toes while running. felt really good when I first put them on, though so I was super disappointed when they didn't work out. Returned.

Brooks Glycerin GTS 19 - local shop sold me a wide width shoe, it solved the numb toe problem but now I have some terrible arch pain like it collapses when I run or something. Store won't accept return, so trying to go directly through Brooks.

I know Altra/Topo are wider in the toe box so that's maybe an option, but I'm not sure there's enough arch support. I could also try the Levitate GTS in a Men's 7, but nobody around here has that size in stock. I do run on trails in Brooks Cascadia and that's been fine! Sorta numb on my toes but not unbearable. Could switch to Altra for trails too, I guess.

For those of you with similar feet (wide toes, narrow rest of foot, high arches), what shoes have you had luck with?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Ok, I went back to the running store to return the Glycerin because when I called they said they'd do an exchange. I tried on a couple more shoes (Brooks Ghost, NB 860) and ultimately left with Asics GT2000 with some low-profile inserts. She said to use them on a treadmill only at first, that way if I hate them, I can exchange for something else. Here's hoping...",2021-09-22 14:13:38+00:00,16,32

I think we here know the pains of finding the right (trail)running shoes.

opp9sb,AskDocs,Chronic Ankle Swelling - 14 months post-surgery - athlete,"Afternoon Docs of Reddit,

Had an ankle arthoscopy in May 20' to clean out bone spurs from the ankle when ankle recovery was poor following sports (primarily basketball.) It typically took a week of rest to reach 100% on the ankle following pick-up games. It's the second time I've had this surgery on this ankle, previously I had it in 13' and the results were spectacular. This time, not so much.

Started running again in Winter 20', and playing Pickup January 21'. Had a significant ankle tear/sprain within 2 weeks despite no rolling of the ankle. Primarily medial ankle pain radiating to the anterior.

I have given up basketball aside from a shoot-around session once a month to check my progress.

Results are, my speed and jumping ability are still there, durability is poor, ankle pain and swelling persist. When not attempting to shoot around, other things that produce symptoms are running (after about 3 miles), and jump rope if I do any right-footed single leg jumping.

I do at home PT. Tibialis strengthening, ankle flossing, balancing, rotation with weight on ankle, calf strengthening and stretching, attempted self-mobilization, cupping, massage. Also I have custom orthotics, and use heavy cushioned shoes like Hokas and stiff soled Nikes. Trying to correct minor knock-kneedness. Also regular lower body workouts to strengthen glutes, hips, quads, etc.

I've seen only small incremenetal progress (ankle used to get sore after about 2 miles of running, now maybe it's closer to 3.5) and then I feel setback if I'm too active (long hike or overly ambitious shoot around) and am limping around for a couple of days.

Is this a nagging medial ankle sprain (6 months) that is being exacerbated by scar tissue from the surgery?

Any other ideas for solutions? I can't think of anything else to try besides PRP (open to) and another surgery (not open to).",2021-07-22 22:57:30+00:00,1,1

At the recommendation of my PT, I bought some Hoka Bondi's for everyday use but wearing tennis shoes all day every day is not feasible. Do you all have any additional shoe recommendations (i.e. ""home"" shoes, sandals, etc.)?

I have Hokas and they fit well for me. I walk about 2 miles a day but this week because of rain and overall bad weather I missed 2 days of walking. My daily walks are downhill one way and uphill the other. It takes me about 45 minutes, depending on how my calves are feeling to do 2 hours when I'm just walking. The 5-mile hike/walk I did last Sunday took me about 2 hours. I am planning on doing about 4 hours this week, so I should be done around 5 pm.

lse1qy,sesamoid,Magnesium was the only thing that helped my sesamoiditis,"I just saw a post about sesamoiditis and immediately was reminded of my years of pain and frustration, so I thought I'd see if my experience might help anyone else. I struggled for years with sesamoiditis and taking chelated magnesium was the only thing that helped. The ones under my left big toe were in three pieces instead of two after I ran a cross country season with terrible shoes my senior year of high school. This made it so when I walked it felt like someone had a knife sawing at the bones with each step. I rested for 3 months, was in a medical boot for awhile, iced daily for years, wore no shoes except for Hokas, and even got ultrasound treatment. Nothing fully helped (although ultrasound did the most), partially because I kept training for NCAA track and field in college like a dummy so it was always stressed. I was in pain always and did poorly at practice and competitions (I cringe looking back). 

I went home for spring break my sophomore year of college and my mom was soooo excited about some magnesium supplements she had heard about on a health podcast. *yeah yeah mom sure whatever, I'll take the supplements this week*. It was easier to just take the pills rather than fight because I doubted they did anything, and it was just a scam to sell vitamins. After a few days my foot felt better than it had in ages but I chalked it up to staying off it during break. 

I went back to college with a bottle of magnesium from my mom tucked into my bag and promptly forgot about them. The pain came back like usual and I didn't think twice. It was my life at that point, pain was normal. After a few weeks I popped a few more supplements after my mom texted me about it, and the pain went almost completely away for a few days. *wait a second* I thought. Could it be? I doubted it, but began taking them religiously, and noticed a huge difference! On days I took magnesium I could walk with no pain, and I even got up the courage to run long distances again. 

For about 8 months, I tracked it and noticed that one dose would help me for about 2.5 days before my foot would hurt again. If I overdid a workout and forgot to ice and take them, 3 days in a row of magnesium would soon put me on the mend. I was doing the same workouts as before, but now painless! My athleticism and mood improved greatly. 

Over time my foot slowly healed, and now I consider it 99.99% better (still get swelling if I do more than 12 miles of intense hilly hikes but that's so manageable). I still am careful, but only take magnesium a few times a week (if I remember) and never really ice anymore. I credit magnesium with improving my quality of life and saving my athletic career. I recommend it to everyone with injuries that are slow to heal. Maybe I was super deficient that's why it helped, but it can't hurt to try. If anyone reading this wants to try, do your research into it first (and look into how calcium is also needed with magnesium) and talk to a doc if you can. Good luck!",2021-02-25 19:01:46+00:00,18,12

l0qfub,hiking,"I've selected a pair of shoes, and would love opinions","For those who might happen to remember, approximately 20 days ago I posted about wanting to get into hiking, especially in regards to getting my kids outdoors.  Well, regardless, the huge thing I knew essentially nothing about was selecting footwear!  I had been assuming that boots would be in order, but found that getting a pair of trailrunners is actually my best bet, especially since I plan on starting off small and quick with my hikes.

After more research I realized that my current casual shoes, that are quite comfortable, do have some drop to them and the Speedgoat 4 has a 4mm drop.  I also am under the impression that having maximum cushion will benefit me as I do have planter fasciitis flare now and then, as well as back issues that can't be ignored.

I have every intention of actually going to the closest Rei store to my home and getting advice from the Reps there before making a purchase - mostly because I also have quite large feet and sizes always seem wacky (I've fit into 12s of one brand and 15s of another).",2021-01-19 18:54:35+00:00,0,8

j5meyv,bunions,Finally I can walk as far as I want with no pain,"I'm 33, and I was diagnosed with mild bunion and early arthritis three years ago (likely it's a traumatic bunion after I fell up the stairs and bent my big toe). For a while, I could only walk a few blocks. I saw a sports medicine doctor, physical therapists, and a chiropractor, and now for a year or two, I've been able to walk around two miles before I experience pain. I was told if I needed more help I would be sent to surgery. I recently sought a second opinion, and the doctor recommended Hoka footwear and a carbon fiber plate. When I was fit for the carbon fiber plate, I was also given a metatarsal support, similar to Dr. Scholl's ""Ball of foot pain relief"" pads.

This weekend, I went for an 11 mile hike with no pain, and I felt like I was in my twenties again. I can't describe how important this is to me- hiking is part of my identity, and I had lost that for the last three years. 

I just wanted to share my experience because I had been looking for solutions for years, and this advice was a revelation. I was so pleased with how well the hiking boots helped me that I bought a pair of used wide trail runners for everyday shoes, and I also bought some Dr. Scholl's pads so I can keep them in other footwear.

If you're interested in buying any of those things I just talked about:

* You can buy Hokas at REI or from their own website. The shoes are available in wide, but not the hiking boots. You can also find a good selection of sizes in the used section at REI. REI has a great return policy so if you're on the fence you can try it. My doctor said these shoes are great for my bunion + arthritis because they are soft, have support, and most importantly, they ""cam"" (the outsole is convex)- helping me with toe-off when I walk.
* There are a number of people online who sell carbon fiber plates- they're about $50 each. The least expensive place to buy them that I found is ""Return to Play,"" which sells a variety of sizes and stiffnesses. My doctor recommended ""medium"" stiffness for me (I got mine from the clinic), and I'm not sure how that translates.
* The Dr. Scholl's pads are only $7 on Amazon. This appears very similar to what the technician attached to the bottom of my insole with electrical tape- the idea is it helps you strike the middle of the foot, taking pressure off your toe.

Sorry if I sound like a schill- I swear I don't work for any of these companies, I'm actually a researcher at a university, and I'm just hoping to help one other person by sharing my journey. I recognize that these solutions won't work for everyone. However this advice has been so life changing for me, if it helps one other person be able to walk even 10% further than they could before, I want to get it out there.

Even if you don't try out any of the three things that have helped me, I hope that my post can inspire you to seek a second opinion if desired, continue advocating for yourself, and keep trying to regain the functioning you need to live your best life. This was maybe the fifth medical professional I'd seen in three years, I wasn't that hopeful that I'd be able to regain any functioning, and I didn't think they would take my concerns seriously because I was already able to walk some distance without pain. I'm so glad I found a clinic with orthopedist who listened to my concerns and had the knowledge to recommend conservative interventions that worked for me- I hope you all have or soon find similarly competent health care professionals.",2020-10-05 16:19:36+00:00,11,3

iuuuep,hiking,How to know a good fit trail running shoe?,"So I am trying to find a good trail runner shoe. I have read a lot about not caring for the brand and going for a shoe that fits great but then I also hear that some great shoes requires some breaking-in so I am confused on what if I get a shoe that feels great when I wear it at the store but longer term ends up causing problems, whilst a shoe that feels not so great, but requires some breaking-in gets passed on just because it felt a little stiff?   

&#x200B;

I have been wearing Salomon XA Pro 3D and they've been great but as I have been hiking more and more I realized they do give me a lil soreness on the inside of my foot(not sure if that is normal) and also a little knee pain on one leg. Learning more about my feet, I realized I have flat feet that are medium wide, but are skinny, with little to no arch. I went to REI the other day and tried on a bunch of shoes and really like the newer model of the same Salomon and also the Hoka ONE ONE (they were real comfy). I realized the Altra 4.5 were kinda weird just because of the zero drop I guess, but my foot did feel a lil roomy in there, which is a good thing I think. I just want to be careful with what I get and not cause injury. I do have an appointment with an Ortho and a Podiatrist just to see if they have any advice. I would love to hear from you guys, with similar experiences and just what should I be looking for in general. Thanks!",2020-09-17 23:24:50+00:00,3,5
iujmwv,XXRunning,Blisters upon blisters upon blisters,"I've been dealing with major blisters, sometimes multi-leveled blisters, on my toes and nothing I'm doing seems to make them better.  I haven't had such bad blisters since my first half marathon.  The first ones were big that I couldn't walk with, so I drained them, put Neosporne on and a bandaid, and basically left them alone.  Then the bandaids caused blisters on the neighboring toes and somehow another blister formed underneath the bandaid.  Then I switched to those hydro seal bandaids that are supposed to create a cushion, but I'm still getting more blisters underneath it.  I even tried putting them in the water during an epsom salt bath (I immediately regretted that).  I'm afraid that my only option is going to be to take a week or something off and let these heal, but I just started to get really consistent with my runs.  The other factors at play, I'm sure, are:

* I'm starting to run longer distances.  My average distance has gone from 3-4 miles to 6-7 miles in a run.
* I got new shoes.  Everything about them feels great.  My knees don't feel shattered by the end of the run anymore and my knee pain doesn't flair up after the run.
* I'm running more consistently.

Is there anything else I can try before I take off a week and potentially lose my progress/motivation?  I'm also doing the Mermaid 200 mile challenge and I'm sooooo close to finishing.  It's definitely been pushing me to do longer runs.  

Edit: I wear a 7.5 wide in every pair of running shoes I've had.  My last two pairs were Brooks Adrenalines, but I switched to Hoka One One Gaviota for the cushioning because I have stuff going on with my knees.  My shoes before that were Mizunos and Asics.

I didn't get an x-ray right away (to try and save money....would not recommend) and tried just walking in walking boot for a few weeks. Pain spiked. I got moved to crutches for 6 weeks once I got an x-ray. Since I still had pain, got put in a cast for another 6 weeks. I eventually got an MRI that showed avascular necrosis of the lateral sesamoid (aka- the dreaded dead bone). My doctor took me out of a cast and just told me to just try walking in Hokas. See if the pain goes away eventually. It's been almost a year and a half since the initial injury and I have tried 2 rounds of steroid injections for pain management (both times it's helped reduce pain for about 1 1/2 months). I still had a consistent slightly bruised feeling on the ball of my foot. Most recently, I must have pushed it too far on a hike and the pain spiked again. I am now trying to decide if I should get surgery. I am seeking a second opinion from the doctor who has been treating me so far.  

Does anyone who has been through this have any suggestions for questions I should be asking the doctors?  (Or questions I should be asking myself before deciding this route?)",2020-08-24 01:16:47+00:00,7,16

gvcrs9,FootFunction,"Connection between flexible flat feet, metatarsals and chronic shin splints","Hi there, 

I‚Äôve been a lurker on this sub and r/BarefootRunning for a long time and have found both immensely helpful. I‚Äòve  had  pretty  chronic  shin  splints  for  the  past  1.5-2  years  and  seem  to  finally  be  getting  to  the  bottom  of  them,  I‚Äôm  seeking  any  advice/wisdom  to  help  me  be  free  from  this  for  the  long  term,  and  tried  my  best  to  sum  it  up  in  two  short  questions  at  the  bottom.  Sorry  in  advance  for  the  long  post  -  I  felt  it  was  important  to  include details.

Shin splint history: 

I‚Äôve had cases of short lived shin splints in the past, but attributed it to high impact sports (basketball) or running too much. However, I just graduated from college and the shin splints I‚Äôve had for the past two years don‚Äôt seem to be from running too much, I‚Äôve barely ran since it started and whenever they go away and I try to do a walk to run program again, they come right back! 

I‚Äôd characterize them as posterior Shin splints/medial tibial stress syndrome, within the past year I‚Äôve also started to get some pain below my knee on the inside. 

I‚Äôve seen multiple orthopedic doctors who haven‚Äôt helped me too much, until a few months ago when one finally told me I have flexible flat feet, this was a revelation to me. I got custom orthotics but then stumbled upon these pages on reddit and bought Merrell trail glove 4s to try and strengthen my feet more, along with doing other foot exercises, icing, compression socks etc. I hadn‚Äôt ran in months but recently started a walk to run program again and it seems to be going much better than before! I‚Äôm doing about half with the merrells and half with my Brooks Ghosts 7s, the rest of the time either wearing merrells or walking around the house barefoot. A new pain that I‚Äôve noticed is metatarsal pain when I do my walk to run sessions, it‚Äôs a stress reaction-type of pain either in the 4th/5th metatarsals or near the base of my toes. 

Here are my two main questions: 

Can having flexible flat feet lead to shin splints? Especially because mine were ‚Äúimmobilized‚Äù in highly cushioned Hokas for a few years. I did a week or two with lots of foot/arch strengthening before the walk to run program and I‚Äôm wondering if that‚Äôs what fixed the shin splints, and if there are any other exercises I can do besides arch strengthening to prevent this from coming back.

Is there such a thing as having weak metatarsals or could something about the way I run/using minimalist shoes be contributing to this pain? I didn‚Äôt think that I had run enough to have it be an actual stress reaction so soon, and it comes and goes/seems to reappear in slightly different locations.",2020-06-02 18:27:13+00:00,6,17

I typically run about 5-6 miles on the treadmill in my school gym, but since I‚Äôve had to move home from college due to the pandemic I‚Äôve been running outside on the trails around my house. I‚Äôve developed a painful blood blister on my right 2nd toe (my longest toe) underneath the toenail and am beginning to develop a small one on my left 2nd toe as well.

What can I do now to protect my feet and relieve some of the pain but keep on running? At least until I‚Äôm able to see a proper physician. The tips of both toes are quite tender right when i wake up and after my runs.

Additional information: I currently run in Hokas that have been fitted properly for my running style and are 4 months old, so I don‚Äôt believe my shoes are at fault for the injuries, I think my feet may be just getting used to the change in terrain?

c5dypr,hiking,Hiking boots - Hallux Rigidus / Hallux limitus,"I am a 44 year old man and I started suffering with what I assume is Hallux limitus a few years back (never formally diagnosed).  Initially thought it was solely down to my walking as I have for years now walked 3-5 miles every day and not always in the best footware.  It came and went though which confused me and then I discovered that without realising I was putting loads of weight on my toes as a sat at work, literally leaning with my weight on my toes all day.  I changed how I sat and the issue disappeared almost entirely.   I say almost as I do still get a niggle so maybe there was some lasting damage but mostly it is fine but I still watch my footware carefully even if I no longer need to always wear rocker soles any more.
 
I am going on a hiking trip to Peru later this year so am shopping for some new boots now so I have plenty of time to wear them in.  I am wondering though as to the best options and think that some boots suited to Hallus Limitus / Hallux Rigidus would be a good idea.  There do not seem to be that many options but I have narrowed it down to the ones below,
 
Hoka Tor Ultra Hi
Hoka Tor Summit (this is a low but is the one Hoka have actually recommended out of their range)
Hoka Sky Kaha ‚Äì Does not have a meta rocker but does to quote Hoka  have ‚Äòrangi bottom foam which has a similar effect to meta rocker soles‚Äô
Salomon Quest 4D 3 GTX ‚Äì No indication that this has a rocker sole but it did come up as a recommended boot on some interweb searches.
 
The Tor Ultra Hi is the one jumping out at me right now but have some reservations as one review said they are quite narrow at the front which is maybe not such a good thing?  I have almost dismissed the summit as I think that a low will not really do the job.

c093mw,CaminoDeSantiago,Just got back from Camino Frances!! Here are my two cents (and cents spent),"Hi All!

My dad and I walked the French route, leaving May 9 and got to Santiago June 9. It was beautiful and amazing, and nothing like we thought it would be. I thought I'd pass observations to those of you preparing for your own Camino.  

To start, we are pretty fit, my dad more than me. He walked 3-7 miles almost every day, and carried a 15-pound backpack to train. I frequent the gym, and tried to also walk at least 3 miles a day.  IMO, there is nothing to really prepare you for the exertion of this. My feet got TORN UP.  The first day over the Pyrenees is hard for everyone, no matter how fit you are. It was long and exhausting. And very quickly we came up with a list of ""Camino Lies"" that we were told while preparing. 

1: ""The Camino is a walk"". Nope. It is a hike, with a backpack. Some carried more loads than others. Ours weighed about 15 pounds.  And it was rarely flat. Every day had hills, even on the Meseta. Keep this in mind while walking your dog 5 miles on pavement. I did to plan well. LOL. 

2:  ""You'll be fine with trail running shoes. Most of the Camino is on pavement"". Maybe 10 years ago, but they have since constructed paths to get pilgrims off the roads (a few Camino vets told us they used to walk a lot along the roadways). Most of the path, I'd say about 70%, was on cobbly and sharp jagged gravel. If you do not have enough cushion on your soles, your feet are going to hurt. I wish I had known this. I saw a lot of Hoka One One and other shoes with extra cushioning. That would be the way to go. But everyone is different. I'd suggest training on some rocky terrain and see how your shoes do.

3:  ""It's a peaceful journey and you'll have lots of time to think and reflect.""  Ha ha ha ha ha. OK well I was a fool for listening to the person who said this to me in the first place.  The French route is so popular now and SO busy. There were very few times we were alone. And getting to Albergues each day became a race. It was ridiculous. Many people were calling ahead and reserving spots, which I thought was kind of bogus.  Toward the end we just said fuck it and started reserving private rooms (that is reflected in our costs) so that we could take our time and know we had a bed at the end.  If you don't want to be woken up at 4:30 most days and be outrun by people racing to the Albergues, make reservations, or consider taking a different route. If I did it again, I'd do the Norte route, or maybe the Portuguese route. 

Overall my experience was good, but I was disappointed by the crowds. Spain in general is clearly more popular now than it used to be, and that makes me happy for Spain, but sad too. We did not expect to be hustled through hordes of people in the Royal Palace or the Prado in Madrid either. That was new to me.  

So what did I spend? Well, all in, I spent $4,377.  I budgeted 4000, so I went a little over. It broke down like this:

Meals: 1,480.  This included pilgrim meals at Albergues, nicer dinners (we had quite a few dinners around 30-50 Euros), nicer lunches, and airport food getting there and home (that's always pricey). 

Lodging:  1,683.  This included $520 of Alergues, with the rest being Pensions and Hotels in bigger cities. We ""splurged"" about every 3 days for our own hotel room.  The most expensive was the 3 nights in Leon, which cost us $270.

Airfare/Travel: $523.  We used AA miles for our tickets from Colorado to Europe, and spent about $500 on Inter-Europe airfare.  If we had bought tickets, flights to Paris were running about $800 at the time.

Other:  Gifts, bars, cabs to places, buses, museums, etc.:  691.  I spent about $300 on tourist stuff and souvenirs for family, and we also had to take a bus from Leon  to Sarria due to injury and time constraints.  Also, I had to buy a new hat and sunglasses, and pastes for blisters, etc. at the pharmacy set us back about 200. So this amount could be lower or higher depending on what you feel like spending. 

&#x200B;

Hope this helps. Sorry if it's so long. Happy to answer questions too. And Buen Camino!

Edit: I just realized that my costs for lodging were for two people, so for one traveler figure half of that. And some meals were paid by me and some by my dad, so some of those costs were split as well.",2019-06-13 17:59:26+00:00,35,30

Usually I'm forced to buy men's shoes since they don't usually make size 13/14 for women- the problem is,men's shoes are  incredibly wide, and I have very narrow feet (3"" at the widest point at rest, 3.5 inches when I'm stepping in, so maybe about 4"" when they expand during walking). Even those marked as 'narrow' sizes are always just a touch too wide, and I get blisters along the sides and soles of my feet as they slide from side to side. I usually have to 'pack' my shoes with insoles and fabric for a snug fit ( even for regular trainers, unless they're stretchy and form-fitting). 

&#x200B;

 I've been hiking/caving for years and I've never found a commercial pair that fit, kind of gave up to be honest, but I'm about to wear through my current pair so I thought I'd give it another go - never asked on Reddit so here we are!

Brands I've tried: Hoka One, Merrel Moab, Timberland (worst fit so far), Bridger, Sawtooth, Lowa, La Sportiva (best fit so far)

Any recommendations for large but narrow fits? Maybe even recc's for custom boot makers? 

( preferably on the sturdy/rigid side as I hike a lot of rough terrain for days at a time)

Thanks for your time guys!",2019-02-20 21:30:48+00:00,2,3
an7hsq,Shoes,Shoe Recommendation,"Hey gang,

I hope I'm posting to the right sub, I'm looking for a direction for a new pair of shoes. I have a bad feet (club foot) and knees and I wear custom orthotics in my shoes to help with leg length disparity and other support. I'm on my feet most of the day for work. I've really grown to like the comfort and support that Hokas offer, however the orthotic inserts raise one of my heels up enough to where the heel cap/cup/counter no longer support my ankle from rolling out and supinating. Do you have any recommendations for shoes that offer good stability and support with a strong heel cap?

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance!",2019-02-04 22:56:13+00:00,4,3

I‚Äôd like them to be at least someone fashionable and available in black. 

Any ideas? I‚Äôm at a loss. I keep buying new shoes and my feet keep hurting.

9onaoj,AskDocs,Best things to do to heal a Morton's Neuroma as quickly as possible?,"Triathlete here (54y white male, 6', 195lb). I originally asked this in /r/running but they don't like medical posts around there. Hoping I get some good advice here.

Around last February/March, I noticed a ""clicking"" sensation in my left foot while running, and sometimes while walking. There was no pain, but there was -something- there going on. I initially got some new shoes with more cushioning (Hoka one-ones) and went for a longish run (about seven miles) and it started hurting really bad. So, I returned the shoes and got another pair of Brooks (Levitates), and also went to the doctor. He referred me to a podiatrist, who told me I had a classic Morton's Neuroma. Note that there wasn't an ultrasound, but he showed me where it was and I can feel it in the ball of my foot where he showed me; I have no reason to doubt his diagnosis even though there's no pain.

At the time I was just beginning a training program for a full triathlon that I had already paid for, so I got a cortisone shot and some orthotics along with a metatarsal pad and gutted it out. I'm happy to say that the serious pain never returned, but I really didn't want to test it so I generally took it easy (slow) on the runs. I also got new shoes with a wider toe-box (New Balance Galaxy-Petrol, wide), and got new cycling shoes as well with a custom metatarsal insert there too (I've never had pain while cycling, but it's ""clicked"" like hell on a few hard and long rides).

Now that race season is effectively over, I want to see if taking a few months off of my feet will make this thing go away. The doctor told me that it might take 3-6 months, and I've read online that it can take even longer than that. I figure that the best thing I can do is help it along--my diet is fairly good (typically lazy Keto and clean/paleo-ish) and I am not afraid to take holistic stuff like tumeric to help with inflammation. I'm wondering if anyone here has gotten good results with other treatments, like toe-spreaders, kinesiology tape, etc... What works, and what's a fad? I'm not looking for a miracle cure, just to get this thing gone sooner rather than later.

Also, I'm planning on trying to maintain my aerobic base with swimming and maybe some light effort, high cadence spinning on my bike in the trainer. Is there any issue there? What about with weight-lifting?

And please, if this is not the right subreddit can you direct me to a place where I might get this question answered?  Thanks in advance!",2018-10-16 12:48:04+00:00,2,4
8fa1uc,hiking,Manaslu Circuit Trek - footwear advice!,"Hi everyone,

I'm going on a trip around the Manaslu Circuit Trek, Nepal, last week of October, first 2 weeks of November.

I really need some advice from somebody who's been there. What kind of boots would you suggest ? \(70l backpack \- no porter\)

I already own a pair of TNF Ultra Fastpack III Mid GTX, very lightweight and comfy but  not very supportive and warm.

The foot tent to slide down when the path goes downhill becouse of the lacing system and I feel like my feet are too much close to the ground  while walking on hiking trails.

I'd like to try out: 

\- Salewa Hiking boots \(Ms Crow GTX, Raven 2 GTX\)

\- La Sportiva Hiking boots \(Trango Tower GTX, Nucleo GTX\)

\- Tecnica Forge S

\- Hoka ONE ONE Tor Ultra Hi WP \(I'm addicted to Hoka shoes, my everyday shoes are the Hoka Bondi 5. Once you put on your feet a pair of these it's quite hard to judge the comfort of another pair...not joking\)

I've already tried:

\- Salomon Quest 4D 3 \(good but heavy and warm...\) 

\- Lowa Renegade GTX \(not a good feeling out of the box\)

Thanks!
