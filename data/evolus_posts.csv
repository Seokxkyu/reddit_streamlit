1jynkyd,jawsurgery,Advice,"The first 2 photos is before & after my DJS-  the next are before If anyone who has had the surgery could give advice it’d be much appreciated! I know that self identity is something most people struggle with after this surgery so I’ve kept that in mind as well as waiting a year for the true result, however I am wondering how much residual swelling did you have? I have always had a string jawline due to my underbite- with them cutting so much of my lower jaw away and bring my upper jaw forward, I am tempted to get chin lipo and potentially Botox to tighten things up so I don’t look like a chipmunk So you think this is just because the surgery was recent or are these options I should look into to improve my look?",2025-04-14 01:42:48+00:00,1,1

1jyn5kp,migraine,Migraine,"Hi friends! 
I am a migraine sufferer since I was LITTLE. I have Narcoelpsy and am on Xywav. Sedative meds are a NO-NO. So I have been without daily preventative since starting this. I was doing a daily and a monthly injection. Now i’m just on the injection. I have had a migraine almost everyday now. It’s a weird burning , tingling sensation it makes me wonder if this is occipital neuralgia. Anyways, do you guys have recs of what to do??? I have taken my rescue meds as much as I am able to and it’s just not working. I do not want to go to the walk in or ER because I will have to skip on my Xywav for my safety. I’m not dehydrated, my sugar levels are fine right now (although i am hypoglycemic). I keep thinking my sugar is low but it legit can’t be because I have downed sugar drinks and ate thinks with protein and my head still feels funny. I’m getting botox next month and i’m scared but i need relief. My neurologist is actually rounding in the hospital this week (i think) and I might pay her a visit at the ER if this doesn’t loosen up ",2025-04-14 01:19:10+00:00,1,0
1jyn4tt,PlasticSurgery,Considering a Lower Bleph for Undereye Creasing/Possible Suborbital Hypertrophic Orbicularis Muscle Reduction,"I'm turning 31 this month, and I've had these deep and unmistakable lines/creases under my eyes since I was a baby—that I feel like the present creases AGE me considerably beyond my years Also, it's very annoying to have to take a qtip and clean deep under my eyes and worry about anything like makeup getting into the creases. I've gotten countless comments how I look ""tired"" all the time when I don't do botox and heavy eyeliner, which doesn't help. I've gotten the jellyroll botox done a multitude of times which, of course, is temporary, and with minimal results desired.

I'm really considering a lower bleph, but..I'm in Atlanta. I've reached out to multiple surgeons:  Atlanta, (Dr. Stanley Okoro), in LA (Dr. Taban), and in Seoul Korea (JK Plastic Surgery, Dr. Kim Sung-Sik).

Dr. Kim Sung-Sik recommended...a lot of things—but notably, the eyes were not mentioned. (Possibly because it is a sought after look for the undereyes) Mandible Angle Reduction + Chin Reduction(Sliding Genioplasty) + Zygoma Reduction, Cheekbone reduction, Genio Implant.

Dr. Taban recommended scarless orbital decompression. 

And

It seems like every surgeon I've reached out to in Atlanta, tells me I'm too ""young,"" which I know is not true, and they tell me that I don't need the surgery until I'm 50. They instead want me to be on some plan to be on botox for 20 years, which I believe is not a good solution for me. It's a problem for me now, and I feel horrible about my eyes and I'd like to solve the problem now instead of waiting for them to appear more prominent. 

TLDR; I would like a smooth lid-to-cheek junction if possible. 

For redditers with this hereditary condition, did you wait to get surgery until later, or did you do it when it was a concern? (like now)

What surgeon do you recommend? I am willing to travel within Atlanta and within the United States, preferably.  ",2025-04-14 01:18:04+00:00,2,0

1jymhv7,aiwars,"""AI democratizes art/makes art accessible"" is a weak, flawed argument and it comes a from a bias.","I'm someone on the fence of AI, but realistically all I want is regulation to protect jobs in the art industry and that billionaire corps don't get to use people copyrighted material without their permission, anything else is fair game and something that should a case by case basis.
However, that's a pro-ai narrative that gets on my nerves and I find it genuinely insufferable.
As annoying of a statement it is, yes, art is at the end of the day ""just pick up a pencil"", or a drawing tablet, paint, ink, thread, fabric, anything and everything around you can be used for art, art is not inaccessible or hard to find, anyone of any ethnicity, belief and income can make art themselves, but most of the times i hear this argument I can tell there's a ""background"" of someone who doesn't really do art at all but needs it for a project, website, a campaign, a AD and therefore needs someone with artistic abilities to make stuff for them, and I'm sorry to generalize, but those kinds of people probably would think anything above 10 dollars for a full color illustration is too much and cry and whine they have to spend money at all and therefore think ""it isn't a accessible"" when again, they could learn themselves, but chose not to.
The bias of this argument is one of ""prettyness"" and ""aesthetics"" and the lack of talent of those seeking it, that a ""pretty picture"" that's well rendered will in fact cost money, because it costs time and materials to be made, and the person who made it obviously isn't a plant living off photosynthesis and needs money to survive in this capitalist world, therefore you need to rely on someone else's talent to make something you need.
You can learn to install a eletric cable, you don't, so you need to call a electrician.
You can learn to unclog a toilet pipe, you don't, so you call a plumber.
You can learn to fix a issue with your car, you don't, so you call a mechanic.
Are any of these ""talents"" inaccessible in today's age? No, in fact you could learn those things from the internet from said professionals giving out this knowledge for free.
Same thing with art, you can learn art of any of kind, you chose not to, so now you need someone else to do it for you. And whether out of a petty inferiority complex or jealousy of the artist ""for doing something as basic as a illustration I could do myself"" you then made up this idea that the artist is ""gatekeeping"" art from you with money, when all they are doing is having a ability you don't have and you need for something, so they are trading their time connect with the ability with you, they aren't evil, selfish or snobby, they have something you don't have or a invested in a ability you didn't.
That narrative is very much over-philosophing a weak argument that has a petty bias behind it. Art is democratic by default, that's why it is censored and been controlled by the elites for such a long time, and art, as a concept, is in fact accessible. 
You being unable to draw a big breasted white woman with botox lips and cleavage exposed when your school never even taught to properly hold a pencil to not develop arthritis and carpel tunnel is really not the end of the world or the problem of someone else tbh.
Please, come up with better argument and narratives to defend what you believe in.",2025-04-14 00:43:39+00:00,0,44

1jylan5,cosmeticsurgery,Anyone here done a lip lift? I found this video by a derm who's about to get one herself,"So I’ve been going down a rabbit hole on lip lifts lately — trying to understand if it's actually worth doing vs just sticking with filler/Botox. I randomly found this YouTube video by a board-certified dermatologist who’s actually getting a lip lift herself, and she breaks down the whole thing in a super chill, informative way.

She talks about:

* Why fillers aren’t always the answer (and why she dissolved hers)
* Different lip lift types (bullhorn, corner, etc.)
* What aging does to facial structure and how that affects lips
* Recovery, scarring, cost — the real stuff

I liked that she didn’t overhype anything, just explained what she’s doing and why. Here’s the vid if anyone’s curious: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9wbfRwuVbs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9wbfRwuVbs)

I'm a journalist and student currently writing an article called Swipe Right for Surgery, which explores the connection between dating app use and cosmetic procedures.

Recent research suggests that women who use dating apps are more likely to undergo cosmetic enhancements (including injectables like Botox or fillers). I'm looking to talk to people who've had any kind of cosmetic procedure—big or small, surgical or non-surgical—about your experience and what led you there.

You can be totally anonymous, and I promise it’ll be a super quick, non-pushy conversation. I’m especially interested in:

What role (if any) dating apps played in your decision
How you felt before/after the procedure
Whether photo filters and online presentation influenced your self-image
This is for a thoughtful and respectful article, not clickbait or judgement.

If you’re open to chatting (even briefly), please DM me or comment and I’ll reach out. Thanks so much in advance!",2025-04-13 23:30:06+00:00,1,3
1jykxzy,30PlusSkinCare,What do I do about newly formed jowls?,"Hi! I'm a little lost on what to do as recently I've started getting masseter Botox for some severe TMJ and migraines. It helps a ton with my pain so I'm not interested in stopping those treatments. It's been about a year since I started. But I've noticed my jowls are more prominent which also emphasizes my double chin. I've also noticed a mid-face slimming that I think has also emphasized the widening/drooping in the lower face. I'm 30.

What kind of non surgical treatments help with this? Is it fillers? Is it more Botox? Is it skin tightening treatments? I see so much mixed information and I'm just genuinely confused on where to start.

I'm not super interested in changing a ton on how I look but I've become extremely self conscious and I feel like I am obsessive over this relatively rapid change in my lower face. ",2025-04-13 23:22:49+00:00,21,31

1jykfhn,vulvodynia,I’m F**cking done.,"I’m done.

I’m done with my bullshit PT who keeps sending me back and back even though it’s doing nothing.

I’ve tried PT for 2 years. I’ve spent countless money.

Botox, every vibrator cream whatever in the book and I’m convinced all they see me as is a check.

I went to a diff gyn and he made a comment about how my years of peak sexual experience and beauty are dying. And he’s right.

I literally don’t care if I bleed at this point I’m just going to deal with the pain and stick whatever in whatever otherwise my option is offing myself in a year.

I’m going to die old unloved and alone. No one has ever chosen me. No one has ever said I was pretty. I live in a city where sex is very popular with my age range and most people start dating after casual sex.

I can’t even do that. Who cares if someone uses me for my body, that’s already happened to me before at least I served a purpose.

I’m tired of getting older and fatter and sadder and being alone. I’m effing shoving whatever in or I’m ending it once I’m 27.",2025-04-13 22:57:21+00:00,4,16

Unpleasant, for sure, but not that excruciating pain that felt like my chest was being torn apart. I can’t believe this is how regular people experience hiccups. I really hope this lasts! Also of note, I’m not burping much even when I drink seltzer and turning my head anymore, but something still seems to be working. Holding on to hope! ",2025-04-13 22:46:52+00:00,3,0
1jyk2ce,PlasticSurgery,My Kybella Experience,"I’m naturally a fairly slim person with a moderately high metabolism, but thanks to genetics, I’ve always had a little bit of fat under my chin. I wanted to nip it in the bud before it got worse with age, so since it wasn’t much, I’d decided Kybella would do.

I had my first and only round of Kybella on 02/03. It has been 10 weeks after my first treatment with Kybella… I wish so much that I could take it back. My swelling should have been gone weeks ago, according to everything I’ve read as well as the nurse that did my injection.

Swelling subsided slowly for about the month of Feb… but then it stopped going down. It’s like the progress just plateaued once March hit. The swelling has been stuck at the same size for over a month now with no changes. Now it looks like I’m stuck with this bullfrog look, and the Medspa I’d gotten the procedure done just gave me $200 store credit and basically, “Maybe lymphatic drainage massage will help 🤷‍♀️,” which is a slap in the face after paying almost $2000 only for my double chin to become WORSE than before.

I’ve had lymphatic drainage massages before, and they did nothing for me. So what does that leave me with?

I’ve also had nerve damage for about 2-3 weeks where my smile was lopsided, because I couldn’t control one side of my mouth as much as before. That was a pretty scary experience.",2025-04-13 22:39:25+00:00,19,5

1jyicyz,Occipitalneuralgia,Back of head swelling?,"Hi all. So I've been diagnosed with Long COVID for 3 years and Occipital Neuralgia caused by that for the same amount of time. I've had BoTox injections which completely failed to alleviate anything, Occipital Nerve Blocks which relieve pain by 100% for about a week then completely back to square one, and now I'm awaiting my Ablation appointment.

My question comes down to signs/symptoms! Everyone tells me that swelling of the back of the head isn't a symptom of ON and isn't related. But for me, I have ON pain come in at least twice a day every single day for 3 years (except when the Blocks are being effective). It's bilateral and so the entire back and sides of my head up over my ears feel like they're on electrical fire, it hurts to the touch, my eyes are painful and have to avoid any light, and there is physical swelling present for the first bottom two inches above my hairline on my skull. I can sometimes even tell when an ON episode is coming because the swelling comes connected. The swelling completely goes away alongside  everything else when the Blocks are in full effect. But everyone just shrugs it off and says that's not comnected.

So please, does anyone else also have physical swelling present?",2025-04-13 21:19:44+00:00,1,3

A male relative let me borrow his phone to browse some women's profiles from his account. After that, I began to feel out of place for even thinking of creating a Bumble account of my own. Maybe it was just the handful of profiles I saw, but I just don't think I can compete with them. I'm not willing to wear revealing clothing and post pictures of cleavage or my butt. I also don't have lip filler or any botox in my face and don't believe in using filters or AI. I'm quite athletic and fit so it's not about hiding myself. I do get dressed up and wear makeup sometimes.

Is this just how the online dating scene is? I get that we are all marketing ourselves here but it just seems like an enormous amount of pressure to be absolutely perfect and sexy.

Basically just curious to know if it really left from one day to the next or what? I’ve never had botox before so i’m not sure how it works! ☺️

i’m liking my lip filler now haha! ",2025-04-13 20:21:51+00:00,1,2

1jyg5b9,noburp,Pretty Sure I Have NoBurp but Not R-CPD,"**TL/DR:** Suddenly my burps got blocked at 16 y.o. in 2008, and they've been blocked ever since. Three high doses of botox have had minimal effects, but I got a manemotry reading that seems to suggest my esophagus is contracting (and blocking burps) several centimeters below the UES. I think I have esophageal spasms that are sort of like R-CPD but a little bit further down the esophagus, rather than at the CP muscle.

**Context/How it began:**

I was able to burp normally until one night in 2008, when I was 16. I was eating a sandwich, took a swallow, felt a “locking/clicking” sensation at my suprasternal notch area, and suddenly I couldn’t burp. My burps were blocked, like a lid had been placed at the base of my neck. Ever since then, my burps have been blocked and I’ve had 24/7 bloating and constipation, like everyone here. When I burp comes up and gets blocked, I often do a hiccup and have the ear pressure, like I’ve seen several other people mention.

When I first heard about R-CPD about a year ago, I figured that I finally figured it out—even though it’s unusual that I developed it suddenly, later in life. I also thought it was unusual that I could feel my blockage to be a little bit lower than where the CP muscle is. I always felt my blockage at the very base of my neck, while the CP muscle is several centimeters higher up the neck.

**Three rounds of unsuccessful Botox for R-CPD:**

I met with Dr. Bastian and Dr. Hoesli, they gave me the nasal esophagus evaluation (it was stretched out, like with R-CPD) and I got 100 units of Botox. The Botox seemed to help a tiny bit—I had a couple burps that squeezed out more easily. But I wasn’t fixed—I still had chronic bloating and major food sensitivities, and the main burp blockage was still there. 

But we tried a higher second dose of 150 units, which turned out the same as the first. Then last week, we tried a third dose of 200 units (!) which has also turned out the same—just a minimal boost in burps.

After three high-dose Botox injections that ultimately each failed to fix my blockage, plus the fact that I developed it at 16 years old, it now seems wise to consider that my blocked burps are caused by something besides R-CPD. But based on where I feel the blockage, I still believe it’s an esophagus issue and the blockage occurs probably very close to the CP muscle.

**Current reasoning—I have an esophageal blockage similar to R-CPD but slightly lower in the esophagus:**

I got a manometry done in February (images attached) which unfortunately very few doctors have paid much attention to. I’ve been mostly on my own to interpret it. I sent it to Dr. Bastian and don’t think he looked at it, but I’m having another video meeting with him and Dr. Hoesli in two weeks, so I’ll ask them to closer a closer look.

I think the manometry holds a huge hint to my issue, because, like I posted about in Feb, one of burps got blocked during the test and it showed on the reading—Swallow #4. The horizontal red lines that continue after my swallow show esophageal pressure, and this pressure occurred as I felt a burp get blocked. This blockage point is about 4 cm below my UES, which aligns with where I feel the blockage to be.

I’ve done some research on “diffuse esophageal spasms,” which are contractions along the esophagus that can disrupt swallowing. But I figure, just like CP dysfunction can affect swallowing or burping, why couldn’t diffuse spasms block burps as well? I think you can treat diffuse spasms with a Botox injection—similar to R-CPD—the doctor just injects a different spot in the esophagus.

**Next steps:**

My next step is to meet with Dr. Bastian, Dr. Hoesli, and potentially other ENTs to ask them to take a closer look at my manometry and confirm if the pressure readings on swallow #4 could be blocking my burps. Then, hopefully we can try to inject Botox into that spot.

Over the past few weeks, the bloated feeling seems to have gotten worse. I also sometimes wake up with these sharp, painful stabs in my chest. I’ve had to wait a whole year to finally get my turn, but the treatment is now coming at exactly the right time. I really hope that soon I’ll be able to live my life burping ‘normally’ and without discomfort. I’m so done with the ‘frog burps’ and the constant bloated feeling. I also hope my bowels will start functioning more normally again, because right now I need fiber supplements just to keep things moving.

Lately, I’ve also noticed that I’ve been letting out small, real burps by accident more often. It hardly ever used to happen, but ever since the pressure in my stomach has gotten worse, these little burps have become a daily thing. Unfortunately, they don’t bring much relief, so I’m hoping this will improve after the treatment too.

1jycw2o,MensRights,‘The great feminism recession: the backlash to gender equality is here — but why?’,">Non-existent body diversity on the catwalk.

LMAO. Ozempic did more to kill ""body diversity"" than anti-feminism. See Figure 2 of [this article](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-06/fashion-pushback-against-plus-size-inclusivity/105082292). Notice that in London Fashion Week, plus-sized model percentage exceeded 80% in Sep '23 and '24. Meanwhile the adult overweight (not obese) rate in London is 56%. In Jan 2025, the percentage dropped to 26%, which is still a lot of representation for a population that is clearly unfit to perform on the catwalk.

>Stay at home girlfriends painting a life of financial dependence as aspiration.

Yawn. More stay-at-home hate

>A 21-year-old actress being told she looks 'old' in the media.

The horror! Tabloids known for creating clickbait articles calls young actress old! This is a crushing defeat for FEMINISM!

Also, could it be that those tabloids are [telling the truth](https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/millie-bobby-brown-photos-GettyImages-2202462909.jpg?w=1024)? Could it be that the botox and fillers actually made her look as old as a Kardashian, and that average Janes don't need to be concerned at all?

>So, can feminism really ever go 'too far'? For me, the simple - obvious - answer is 'no'. To me, feminism is a movement to promote equality between different genders. Part of this equality is about eradicating static gender roles; the ones that say that men have to be tough, silent, bread winners, and women have to be soft, submissive caregivers. The norms that suggest any gender fluidity between these poles doesn't exist. **Ultimately it's about giving people the freedom to explore the full spectrum of their humanity, rather than forcing anyone into a predetermined role.**

Ironic, because the author clearly hates it when women choose differently, see this paragraph:

>Ultimately, choice — **supporting women's wrongs** as well as their rights, supporting **women who genuinely want to embrace the stay-at-home life** — is an important aspect of contemporary feminism. But it's also important that we all **scrutinise our choices and beliefs** in order to get closer to our authentic selves. That way, we can know that we made our choices ourselves, rather than **bowing to any cultural pressure**. And while all of this soul-searching and questioning can seem futile in the face of what we're up against, it's worth it.

Do they think that feminism is not a cultural pressure? She thinks that stay-at-home women (and not girlbosses) should be HOUNDED with criticism until the feminists are absolutely sure that the women aren't held hostage or something. THAT, in my mind, is the true cultural pressure.

Feminism has more cultural capital than cultural conservatism, and it's not even close. Even religious apologists are battling each other and calling their own faiths ""the most feminist"" to get others to join their faiths. When the priestly class pays fealty to Feminism, that's when you know that your entire society has been subverted and flipped upside down.",2025-04-13 17:23:44+00:00,66,21
1jycp88,SkincareAddiction,[anti-aging] smile lines and wrinkles deeper,"I feel my under eyes have aged a lot in the past year and would really appreciate advice on skincare or any other tips to help - I’m F26 and not considering Botox!

1jyc20u,breathwork,"I feel like my entire breathing pattern is broken, and I don’t know how to fix it?","Hi everyone,

I’m 29y old and I’ve been struggling with my breathing for as long as I can remember. I feel like something is fundamentally wrong with the way I breathe, but I don’t know what or how to fix it. Here’s a bit of context:

	• I was born premature and have had asthma since birth. It was pretty bad during childhood, but since puberty it’s been under control with medication.
	• I also have chronic sinusitis. I’ve had two surgeries already, but no real long-term relief. I’m still working with an ENT specialist to figure things out.
	• I used to be unable to burp. I recently got a botox injection for this, and now I can burp, which helps a bit with bloating.
	• I haven’t been officially diagnosed with ADHD, but teachers and friends have said for years that I “definitely” have it. I never got tested because it didn’t affect my school performance, and I didn’t want another label.

The breathing issue:

I think I breathe very shallow and irregularly. People who lie next to me have often mentioned how strange and inconsistent my breathing is. I breathe through my mouth a lot, probably because of my sinus issues. I try to avoid it during the day, but I’m almost certain I do it at night.

I’m still often bloated, and since I can now burp, I’ve started wondering if maybe my bloating isn’t (only) digestive, but related to the way I breathe. I think I subconsciously gulp air or hold my breath in. Sometimes I feel like I look pregnant because of how bloated I am, even though I’m not overweight. I’ve started noticing that I unconsciously hold in my stomach all the time, which makes things worse, and I can’t seem to stop doing it.

I’ve tried mindfulness and breathing exercises (like the 4-7-8 technique), but they’re really hard. I feel like I’m running out of air or like my body reacts strangely to them.

Has anyone gone through something similar? Where should I even start? I’d appreciate any advice or shared experiences.

Thanks in advance!

1jybyqd,30PlusSkinCare,How can I look better for my age or look a few years younger,"Hi! I just recently became aware that my skin is really aging and not sure what I could do to make it look better. I do like to keep it as natural as possible and am more into how to look best for my age and maybe look a few years younger, but still not too obsessed with my looks.

I would consider some procedures such as blepharoplasty. I am less afraid of going under the knife vs injecting all sorts of things in my body or doing these new radiofrequency treatments which I don't feel are yet understood well in terms of their side effects on overall health.

I have battled acne almost entire life and used a lot of exfoliating products, did a few lighter chemical peels and hoped that would help with some fine lines. I've also used some retinol pn and off. I tried botox and lip fillers two years ago and did not like it. Felt really unnatural. I am planning another pregnancy soon so would avoid retinol and botox for some time but open to try it again later in life if there are no better solutions. Few days ago I had my first microneedling session and am planning to keep doing it.

I also want to try to lose some weight, as I don't like my underchin fat, but at this point wondering if fat loss would make things look better or worse due to loss of volume.

Here are a few pictures of me today from different angles. Skin is a bit dry post microneedling. I feel good about my appearance when my face is static, but in the pictures where I smile or from some angles, it looks really bad. Especially the crows feet and jawls :(

Also posting a few older pictures with different lighting and different skin hydration levels.

Open to hear some advices or personal experiences with crows feet or under neck fat. Also curious what do you think how old I sm?

5. FaceTune Filters - Kylie FaceTunes and edits her photos, including defining her jaw.

Let's be real: Kylie's face has never-and will never-look the way it does on her Instagram. The girl's out here living in a world where every unpaid paparazzi photo is a jump scare, and she knows it. That's why she practically sprints from cameras unless she hires the photographer, controls the lighting, and edits the pics harder than any other celebrity. 


She doesn't just Facetune-she face engineers. We're talking hours of editing just to keep up the illusion that her heavily modified face is ""just growing up"" and ""maturing gracefully."" Like please-your jawline didn't sharpen itself overnight, and your cheeks didn't just evaporate.

All this effort because her entire brand relies on the only two things she consistently sells: her face and her body, which she then uses to push cheap, private-labeled products with a massive markup.

When I did believe in God, I was interested in writing a book adaptation to the Book of Job in my own way. I wrote ten solid pages and all of a sudden, I couldn't breathe. I developed asthma in an instant and it was scary like I was breathing under water or I even thought I was having a stroke. I didn't even know what asthma was. So, I stopped writing about Job. I overcame the asthma after two years of not breathing the right way. Then two years later, I was playing with a new character in Greek Mythology and my brain lit on fire which was probable inflammation in the brain. Very painful. But, I got Botox injections and beat that too even though it still hurts right now. 

Can my brain be hacked? That's the crazy God Complex question.

I hope it can't. I hope my own ideas for work are mine and not something else's. Something else that I will never see or shake hands with.

I'm new to Atheism. I have Atheism for Dummies and when I read it, it's very relaxing. It takes the Mind Hacking problem away.

1jy4mj9,POTS,Sweating - has anyone figure out how to manage it?,"I start sweating as soon as I stand up. If I'm just laying on the sofa, I usually don't, but if I walk to the bathroom - sweating. Heating food - sweating. Getting out of the shower - there's sweat beneath the water. 

It's mostly cold sweats, and I really don't like it. The creeping feeling beneath my skin makes me wonder if my bp is dropping. When I check it's usually slightly elevated actually, like 130/80 and HR 87, but sometimes I have 90/60 and HR 120, but the feeling is exactly the same (I'm on bisoprolol btw).

Has anyone found anything that helps? I've heard magnesium might work for some people. Some have done botox on the worst places. For me, it's the feeling, not the actual sweat that is my main concern (even though that's bothersome as well).",2025-04-13 10:26:04+00:00,8,4
1jy40cz,noburp,"2-year Botox success update (Ms Hicklin, in-office)","TLDR: 50 units of Botox, one round. Still burping! Didn't totally cure my stomach issues, but helped A LOT and has been life-changing. [You can read my post-op experience here](https://www.reddit.com/r/noburp/comments/vbhtiz/botox_with_ms_hicklin_inoffice_london_1week/) (my old account that I can't find the password to).

I was a lifelong RCPDer, never able to burp but the symptoms only really getting bad in my 20s. Gurgles, bloating, being suuuper gassy! I knew I probably had gut imbalances, but once I found the NoBurp sub I realised a big part of my issues must be due to the no burp. 

Back then, the only doctors I'd heard of doing Botox were in the States, under general anaesthetic, costing thousands of $. I couldn't afford that with the trip over. Then years later, I heard that there was someone here in London, Ms Hicklin, offering it in-office for £850 at the time. After being reassured by a lot of posts in this sub, I went for it. You can read my post-op experience at the link top of this post. It was pretty easy going, both the actual injection itself and the recovery! It took awhile for things to settle, and I was burping a lotttt in the early weeks, but I didn't mind. (I did wonder, am I going to be burping this much forever?! But, it did settle, lol.) 

Now 2 years later, I'm still burping easily, and it's been a godsend. The gassiness has been reduced by A LOT. My stomach symptoms haven't gone away entirely, but as I said I likely have other gut imbalances or dietary intolerances. Still, it's like night and day. Prior to burping, I had constant bubble gut, and was gassy all day long; I struggled sitting in an office all day, even sitting next to friends and family watching a movie or hanging out, because I was constantly holding in gas. It was hell! Now, I can hardly even remember what that felt like. I still have bloating and some gas, but I can socialise, I can be intimate, I can relax, I can function. I'm so grateful for that.

My burps are totally control-able, other than if I drink a whole bunch of fizzy drink and one might slip out right after I swallow! It's never been a problem socially, and my burps sound more like air escaping so they're pretty quiet. When I get nervous, I let up tons of tiny burps. Pre-Botox, those used to be gurglefests, and I'd have to make myself throw up to make it stop. But now it's just a tiny-burpfest. 

One new thing I have to deal with sometimes: heartburn and acid reflux! This is something I never experienced in my life until Botox. I am still figuring out my exact triggers, but generally if I eat healthy and keep my stress low, I don't have a problem with it. And if ever I do get it, a Rennie antacid tablet eases it right away. The one time the reflux caused a real bad issue was when I was on doxycycline for rosacea. One of the side effects can be reflux and esophagitis, and even though I took it with food and made sure I wasn't lying down as long as possible after taking it, I would still wake up with burning in my throat (and sometimes nose). I stopped the doxy pretty soon as it gave me other side effects too. I generally sleep with a couple of pillows so my head is tilting a little upwards, which I think helps. I'm a singer, and thankfully the reflux hasn't screwed up my voice. 

So, I'm still dealing with my stomach issues but I'm glad to have eliminated the NoBurp factor so I can see what I'm dealing with now! That's a whole other can of worms (have seen so many gut specialists and doctors, and always tested negative for SIBO, candida, celiac, etc.). I find things calm down a lot the more I listen to my body and take care of my mental health. 

So grateful for this subreddit and people sharing their experiences.",2025-04-13 09:41:06+00:00,3,3
1jy3syr,chinalife,Fake beauty doctor in Guangzhou on Instagram ads?,"I live in Guangzhou and recently get lots of instagram ads about beauty treatments in China. I sometimes do some facials at salons around my area but these ads are about more invasive medical procedures (botox, surgery, face lift, laser, hair transplant, teeth veneers).
I was curious if this was legit and reacted to one of the ads. A „doctor“ immediately responded to add my wechat and get a free consultation in Guangzhou. I asked about his credentials or any more info like some WeChat Miniprogram, Meituan or Dianping Page but he does not have it. He only shows some before/after photos and videos of consultations with foreigners since he says he is specialiced on procedures for foreigners. His English is suspiciously great compared to other doctors in legit clinics in Guangzhou.

I have never seen his clinic in person but it seemed a bit off to me. I think if my gut tells me something is fishy, it would not be good to give it a try and risk to getting botched.

Have you ever heard of anything similar? Is it a scam with fake doctors and dangerous procedures?

 ## Key Features Analysis

The Truffoire Black Truffle Vitamin C Eye Cream boasts a range of features designed to address multiple concerns associated with aging around the eyes.

**Black Truffle Extract:** This is the signature ingredient, sourced for its rich antioxidant content. Black truffles are believed to help protect the skin from free radical damage, which can contribute to the formation of wrinkles and other signs of aging. It is a rare and luxurious ingredient intended to provide superior antioxidant protection.

**Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid):** Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant known for its skin-brightening and collagen-boosting properties. In this formulation, it helps to reduce the appearance of dark circles, even out skin tone, and stimulate collagen production for firmer, more resilient skin. The concentration and form of Vitamin C used is important for stability and effectiveness.

**Hyaluronic Acid:** This hydrating ingredient acts as a humectant, drawing moisture into the skin and helping to plump up fine lines and wrinkles. Hyaluronic acid helps to maintain the skin's hydration levels, leaving it feeling soft, smooth, and supple. Its molecular weight impacts its ability to penetrate the skin and provide lasting hydration.

**Acetyl Hexapeptide-8 (Argireline):** Often referred to as ""Botox in a jar,"" Argireline is a peptide that helps to reduce the appearance of expression lines and wrinkles by relaxing facial muscles. While not as potent as injectable Botox, it can provide a temporary smoothing effect for a more youthful appearance. The effectiveness varies depending on individual skin and the concentration used.

**Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract:** This soothing ingredient helps to calm and hydrate the delicate skin around the eyes, reducing irritation and inflammation. Aloe vera is known for its healing and anti-inflammatory properties, making it a valuable addition to an eye cream. It can also help to reduce puffiness and redness.

Key features of the Truffoire Black Truffle Vitamin C Eye Cream include:
    * Black truffle extract for antioxidant protection
    * Vitamin C for brightening and collagen boosting
    * Hyaluronic acid for intense hydration
    * Argireline for wrinkle reduction
    * Aloe vera for soothing and calming effects

 ## Core Benefits

The Truffoire Black Truffle Vitamin C Eye Cream aims to provide several key benefits for users concerned about aging around the eyes.

**Reduced Appearance of Wrinkles and Fine Lines:** The combination of Argireline, hyaluronic acid, and black truffle extract works synergistically to smooth out existing wrinkles and prevent the formation of new ones. Users may notice a visible reduction in the depth and appearance of fine lines over time, resulting in a more youthful look.

**Brighter and More Even Skin Tone:** Vitamin C is a potent brightening agent that helps to fade dark circles and even out skin tone around the eyes. Consistent use can lead to a noticeable improvement in the overall radiance and clarity of the skin, making the eyes appear more awake and refreshed.

**Improved Hydration and Elasticity:** Hyaluronic acid provides intense hydration, plumping up the skin and improving its elasticity. This can help to reduce the appearance of crepiness and improve the overall texture of the skin around the eyes, giving it a more supple and resilient feel.

**Reduced Puffiness and Inflammation:** The soothing properties of aloe vera help to calm inflammation and reduce puffiness around the eyes. This can be particularly beneficial for individuals who experience morning puffiness or irritation due to allergies or other sensitivities.

 ## FAQs Section

**Is the Truffoire Black Truffle Vitamin C Eye Cream suitable for sensitive skin?**
  While the formula includes aloe vera to soothe the skin, it's always recommended to perform a patch test before applying any new product to the entire eye area. Ingredients like Vitamin C can sometimes cause irritation in sensitive individuals, so it's best to proceed with caution.

**How long does it take to see results with this eye cream?**
  Results can vary depending on individual skin type and the severity of wrinkles and dark circles. Some users may notice an improvement in hydration and a reduction in puffiness within a few days, while more significant changes in wrinkle depth and skin tone may take several weeks of consistent use.

**Can this eye cream be used in conjunction with other skincare products?**
  Yes, the Truffoire Black Truffle Vitamin C Eye Cream can be incorporated into a regular skincare routine. It's typically applied after cleansing and toning and before heavier moisturizers. It's also safe to use under makeup.

**What is the shelf life of this eye cream?**
  The shelf life is typically printed on the product packaging, often indicated by a ""PAO"" (Period After Opening) symbol. This specifies the number of months the product remains effective after opening. Generally, eye creams have a shelf life of 6-12 months after opening.

1jy2hvr,Advice,Comments on appearance.,"I’m a 31yo female with a pretty average appearance. I don’t care to impress people with makeup or doing my hair in a special way, I often shower & blow dry it and that’s that. Makeup hurts my eyelids and my skin has been better since I stopped using it so I just don’t bother anymore. I think I look pretty basic for 31 with a normal amount of wrinkles for my age. 

What I can’t handle is the amount of women who have been in my life (past and current) who feel the need to tell me I should have work done. I’ve had “friends” tell me how much my work would cost and what it should entail, ask me why I don’t want plastic surgery, ask me if my breasts are real/where I’ve had them done, and even offer to get me discounts with their surgeons or team. It leaves me gobsmacked every time because I would never walk into a room of my friends and start pointing out their appearances in a negative way. Firstly, it is none of my business unless they look like they’ve been stressed or sick, in which case I’ll ask them if they’re okay, not tell them they look like shit. Secondly, not everyone is chasing goals for their body that are unattainable. Some of us are actually okay in the body we were born. Thirdly, when did aging become such a bad thing? The cringiest thing on this earth to me will be to reach 75 and look like a leather boot because my face was poked with god knows how many cc’s of Botox in my 30-60s. 

I would never judge my friends for what they chose to do or not do so long as they’re decent people. I just don’t know if I can handle the judgement anymore. It makes me want to lock myself in my house with my fiance and our pets and never see another soul again. ",2025-04-13 07:49:29+00:00,1,3
1jy1olb,antiMLM,Modere queen of the huns and its downfall,"So I start this off with the pretex of the lady is someone I went to school with and she has been doing MLM since about the age of 24. I’ve watched many of her ventures and she’s tried to recruit me for many of her schemes also. So a good 8-10 years.
She is the queen of any company she joins and is usually somewhere near the top. A parent passed away when she was young, the life insurance money bought her way through the MLM world and makes her very successful in what ever she does. She’s one who’s constantly on the trips with awards all sorts. If you saw her and the life she leads she’d convince you that MLM is absolutely everything they say and more. But when you “know” her properly you see the real side. She specialises in recruiting parents as she has some children and loves the promote the having a job that works around your children and from home. So for me she’s the worst type of MLM hun there is. 

So last night on her socials she does the live but doesn’t give any details on why modere has apparently closed shop. She is very clear in her message that she has no idea why they have stopped what ever they do and she was not told any information even tho she is a leader. I find this suspicious but nonetheless she’s preaching about how she’s been through worse than this and will bounce back because she’s a boss babe blah blah blah. She seems to have a hand in any dodgey MLM there is out there. 

A few years back one company she was with went under very much the same style as this one, leader hun was stationed in her normal country of England when this went down. By the next week she had disappeared off social media and relocated over night to Spain ! Claiming her job allowed her to do this. After a shocked deep dive on the old google I actually found some pretty shocking stuff that she was being looked into by multiple agencies for selling products that had claimed to be something they were not, unregulated completely and also for tax fraud etc. 
She hid in Spain for a good year clearly avoiding what ever was waiting for her at home. Then she was making the shock move home as she had found the “ONE” which was modere. Hawking the products as miracle products and you will look like her all the while she fills her self with Botox, plastic surgery, extensions and fake tan. Her coffee was the reason she lost all her last lot of baby weight what she fails to mention is she actually develops diabetes while pregnant and it drops off naturally once she’s not. You can see the level of deception she achieves with her selling her products. 

She’s been selling the package and life experience of modere since then and to see yet another sink with her being close the top really is no coincidence. I have tried to find any info but so far I’ve come up with nothing. Any information on this one would be fantastic people must know what had actually happened. Still I have a front row seat for this one also so I will you all updated with the trials and tribulations of this queen of MLM world ! Please if you know who this is don’t dox her. I’m just looking for any info on modere and it’s very quick departure.

**My dentist broke my night guard. I said they need to replace it for me, free of charge. AITAH?**



I have been waking up with jaw soreness and stiffness in the mornings for about a year. Since January, I believe this has gotten worse.

I wear my custom night guard religiously every single night. I got this in 2019 for grinding/clenching. I take excellent care of it - cleaning and letting it air dry during the day.

On Monday, I visited the dentist to have a conversation about possible solutions. Botox, new night guard, anything. I just wanted to talk options.

She said do a bunch of jaw exercises, we’ll also adjust your night guard and come back in a few weeks to see how it’s going. I said ok.

Well, the dental assistant adjusted my night guard and grind it down to almost nothing. I said “wow it’s really thin now!?” And she said “if there’s any problems we can just order a new one.” I didn’t think it was that bad. Maybe I would wear it down after a few weeks or months.

Next morning there’s two holes in it. It’s unusable. I can see how THIN she made my night guard.

I called the dentist the next morning (Tuesday) and they said they’ll cover 50% of the cost for a new night guard. I said that’s unacceptable. It’s because of you that my night guard is unusable now?!

The secretary I spoke to was very defensive about the whole thing and it really put me off. She said she’ll talk to the dentist and get back to me. It is now Thursday evening; they haven’t answered me yet and I called them around noon today…

AITAH? How I was raised, if I am responsible for breaking something that does not belong to me, I replace it. It doesn’t matter if I was not the one who broke it. If I borrowed someone’s tool and wore it down so much that it broke during the next use, I am responsible.

I understand the night guard needed adjustment. The problem I have is, should the DA really have ground it SO much?! I am completely open to buying a new night guard. But I never said I wanted to get rid of my old one.

*I would suggest planting your bottom in their waiting room until someone there speaks to you and deals with this. Feel free to chat with other patients while you are waiting.*



**Altruistic-Parsnip33**

*Lifespan of a typical night guard is around 5 years according to my dentist so while they are at fault for causing it to break early, they are probably taking the lifespan into consideration. Dont think theres anything wrong with trying to get more covered but odds are, you wont be very successful*

>OOP: This is probably the most realistic viewpoint. It’s unfortunate but most likely to be true I believe. :(



**Zerah\_Pumpkin7638**

*NTA. They broke it, they replace it. Period. Don’t let them off the hook*

>OOP: How do I not let them off the hook? What leverage do I have?

*Small claims court. gonna have to decide if 50% is enough that you are willing to avoid the hassle/time*

>OOP: Lol an attorney would be so much more than 50%. They quoted me $850/2=$425.00.



**TarzanKitty**

*No lawyers in small claims and you can file your case for like $25.*

>OOP: The problem is that there is a big shortage of dentists where I am. Most are not taking new patients. I need to work with this dentist and my fear is that if I filed a claim against them, I’d essentially be blacklisted.

**Update - 1 day later**



The dentist called me yesterday and said they’d replace my night guard for me free of charge!

Thank you to everyone who commented!

For me, it was never about the cost of replacing it. It is the principle of it all. I’m so glad I stuck up for myself!

I’m so thankful it didn’t last all day and I did have the too much medicine feeling which I normally never get, and I seriously NEVER nap so it’s kinda weird I did but I think it was completely migraine related and due to the migraine hangover.

I’m sure one will be back tomorrow, but for today, I’m happy it felt more classic.

Oh and I don’t get much pain from mine. Thanks to Botox they’re reasonably silent.",2025-04-13 04:41:43+00:00,5,1
1jxyyfz,milwaukee,Botox in Milwaukee recommendations? Fairly priced plastic surgeons/cosmetic dermatologists/experienced RNs preferred.,I almost booked Illume but then read many bad reviews unfortunately. ,2025-04-13 03:49:39+00:00,0,17
1jxyvj7,noburp,How I live with my No- burp Syndrome (16+ years),"First I will start off by saying, I am NOT a doctor. I do not have medical experience in the field related to this Syndrome. I am simply someone who has lived with it and want to note down the things that have helped my every day life, minimalistically painful. 

My diet consists around mainly Chicken, Fish, Venison and certain veggies and fruit. The meat is a personal preference and is to not be taken too literally. I like to avoid beef because of it's high fat content. I've come to realizes most greasy or fat filled foods will turn into more gas. Venison is a leaner version of Beef. For anyone who doesn't know what the term venison means, it's deer meat.

As for my vegetable experience. I have found that the greener a veggy is the more likely it will cause gas. Cabbage, brussel sprouts, lettuce, spinach and many other leaf based veggies may hold a higher gas content. Beans and peppers also hold a higher gas content than other veggies. I stick mainly to a diet of asparagus, carrots, potatoes, tomatoes and peas.

I will still eat a few of the veggies listed but will require gas pills to help relieve the built up pressure.

For fruits I stick to most non acidic fruits, good fruits that I have found are melons, bananas, strawberries, grapes, pears, oranges and certain varieties of apples (honey crisp, pink lady, gala). Fruits I like to avoid are plums, peaches, certain varieties of apples (granny smith, red/golden delicious, Fuji), cherries, lemons, limes, grapefruit and cranberries.

I find that canned fruit are a lot less gassy than fresh fruit from the market.

Sodas I've found are light in gas content are Dr Pepper and Sprite. Most off brand sodas are also light in gas content. I like to stay away from Pepsi, Ginger Ale, Root Beer and other darker sodas. Although the color of sodas is relatively irrelevant I've found that cola based sodas have relatively higher gas content than most other sodas. I personally perfect the Zero sugar version of the sodas I mentioned above because sugar adds more gas buildup. 

Other drinks that are light in the stomach are: Gatorade, Powerade, Tea, tomato soup/juice, and coconut water. I don't recommend drinking high amounts of apple or citrus juices unless you know your stomach can handle it. I perfect the Zero sugar version of the drinks listed above.

Dairy products can cause a lot of gas for some people. I personally don't experience many problems with dairy products. Cheese does have a high gas content but it isn't enough to push me personally over the edge.

I like to avoid eating chips and bread at all cost. Yeast and grease hold high amounts of gas content. I've found the best type of chips to eat are lightly salted tortilla chips and lightly salted potato chips. Flavored chips may have more gas content than the original flavors. Freshly baked breads should be avoided at all cost. Yeast has the highest gas content compared to anything else I've ever had. If I am to eat bread store bought loafs are the best option to have the smallest amount of gas buildup.

These are my personal diet choices and anyone is welcome to add suggestions of their own on what to avoid and what is okay to drink/eat. Thank you if you did view this post and read it to the bottom.

I don't intend to ever get Botox. If I find more food that is soft on the stomach I will update this post :).",2025-04-13 03:44:37+00:00,0,11

1jxyjca,PelvicFloor,How would you feel about diagnostic injections?,"Hi, 

To make it simple I had undiagnosed labral tears and during a urology procedure my muscles in my pelvis spasmed. My nerves got impinged causing pudendal nerve issues but on MRI they are okay. Botox and triggerpoints plus PT have helped. Doing some diagnostic shots with pain management in different muscles around the pelvis to see if that loosens thing up and helps my symptoms. My Dr finds me interesting they noted and it feels so much better than I give up. There is pain at times as it's like real life jenga with my tight muscles and still working on building up my muscles for the labral tears. Multiple Dr's have warned labral tear surgery may not help and there is a small risk of pudendal nerve irritation from those surgeries. Also a long recovery time. 

I know it's not conventional but how would you feel about targeting different muscles with triggerpoints and seeing how the body responds? No clue if this will take months or years. Interested if anyone else has experienced this. ",2025-04-13 03:24:02+00:00,1,1

Many years ago I was shopping with my sister in Sephora for skincare and she was accosted by an associate that in the course of helping her criticized her skin and started wiping off her makeup(did not consent) to apply a product. It was humiliating for her and to this day kind of makes me wary to shop in person there.

I’ve been thinking about this topic though because yesterday I went for Botox and had a new person do it. When I sat down in the private room with this injector I do not know at all - she pulls out my chart and flatly says “you have anxiety and depression.” This came out of NO where. Like I get she needs to check my file, but like no “nice to meet you!” No opening chit chat. Just flatly saying that followed by like 10 seconds of silence. 
I was so taken back and embarrassed I couldn’t speak. I’m not even ashamed of my issues - I would feel comfortable telling people, but I cannot stress enough how weird this felt. Like I’m here to get Botox and she might as well have started with “your uncle was murdered when you were 9 years old.”

I asked my friend if I should do delivery or store pickup and she said store pickup since I know she wanted to see it right away. 😂 As I was about to place the order, I remembered that I had store merchandise cards!

I went Friday after work and I go figured if they did not have it, I have two Ulta’s closer to where I live that I can try and then worse case order it for delivery. I got to the store and there were none. I decided to ask and they got one from the back - even though the girl look annoyed.

I was able to check out and used my store merchandise cards and I paid $0 out of pocket when using girl math! I am so excited!

I am new to the community and I sincerely wanted to ask for some advice for this problem that I have been dealing with for years, to give more context when I was little I had extremely straight hair, inherited from my father, but since I was 15 my hair was practically damaged, I mean it stopped being straight and I started to have a lion's head, my mother tried to accommodate it with products for straight hair, botox and repolarizations.

1jxtxfr,noburp,Finally!!,"I'm so happy I just had to tell someone a bout this.

So, littke backstory: I have rcpd and have only had tiny burps once in a while (so tiny they don't give me any relief at all). And I've never been able to make myself burp. I also have IBS, so these two together have caused me to be bloated and in pain most of my life.

So recently I started doing research on reddit because I can't live like this anymore and with me living in Sweden it's been almost impossible to find help and get botox (no one takes me seriously lol, relatable?) I read about people trying different techniques to help them learn how to burp, but none of them worked. Until that one evening when I drank so mych soda, stood in the bathroom and pushed my tongue down and forward with my toothbrush. I gagged so many times, but then finally came the air vomiting. Just a tiny one, and then I had zero energy to continue. I managed to do this again a few days ago.

Today I was brushing my teeth, and I always brush my tongue at the end. This ALWAYS causes me to gag. Notihng more than that. But today air and what sounden like a burp came out! It was pretty small and didn't give relief, but I feel like this is a sign that my body's getting more and more used to letting air out! This made me so incredibly haopy because I've been in so much pain and tried to fix it for so long. I hooe that in the future I can learn how to burp and be more free och my pain and discomfort.

Context about myself: 
I have lots of friends.
I'm considered a 'leader' of my friends.
I am ahead in my career. 

I am really approachable, super nice,  I am smart but not ridiculously Intelligent, I believe I am ahead in my career due to my  people/relationship building skills.
 
My mantra is that it's nice to be nice, always be nice and understanding and patient with people.

I think that has gotten me far.

Another mantra is to kill my enemies with kindness and be relaxed about life. 

I think that has also gotten me far.

The issue: 
My ego, 
2 girls drove past Mr today, I thought, wow they have a lot of Botox that's crazy, then I thought, wait? What if social standards have driven them to do that? That's sad, THEN I was like, it's none of my business why do I care? And finally, I thought 'maybe not caring after such a troublesome internal battle to be here is ignorance?' 

Not only that,  but I have ego issues, I have a superiority complex, but I can cast my mind outside it to see, I am very much inferior, I have no right to have a superiority complex, but even if I did, that's morally wrong? 

My mum and dad have done everything for me since the day I was born id be dead without them. 

And yet, before I catch the thought and cast it away, I judge them for their career progress.

1jxtcr2,MCAS,Itchy and unsure,"Hi there,

I would love to know if people think it's reasonable to explore MCAS as a possible diagnosis with my symptoms. I have been discussing my symptoms with my GP at length for months and have an appointment with an immunologist for June. I have been prescribed 2 fexofenidine tablets morning and night. These stopped the hives but haven't stopped much else. I tried citrizine too, but they gave the same results. 

My overall symptoms are itchy skin, hives, difficulty breathing (I'm an asthmatic and this feels different), low blood pressure, rapid heart rate, diarrhoea every morning with severe abdominal cramps, dry itchy eyes, bright red face all the time, super dry skin, abdominal bloating. I am also diagnosed with anxiety and c-ptsd but not a day goes by without severe anxiety. I see mental health professionals and it helps a bit but not enough. I am very intolerant to any antidepressants. I am also diagnosed with chronic migraine and still get a migraine about once per week despite botox injections and other prescribed medications. I also have diagnosed GERD which is semi-controlled with Nexium. 

I'm definitely not looking for a diagnosis here, but am looking for some confirmation that asking for support investigating possible MCAS isn't crazy. 

I'm in Australia, so I'm unsure how our treatments stack up to overseas. All I do know is I'm incredibly itchy and fed-up.

Also they pump gas into your stomach & if the burping isn't happening at that point could be awful? l I feel like the medical staff just aren't going to understand about the botox & any complications that it could cause. 
Or should I get the gastroscopy & postpone the botox?

1jxrn0f,Weibsvolk,Bücher/Artikel Thema seinen Körper akzeptieren,"Hallo ihr Lieben,

ich bin letzte Woche 28 (ich weiß!!! Ich bin noch jung aber genau deshalb finde ich es wichtig das auszusprechen) geworden und habe allmählich das Gefühl ein Problem mit dem Altern zu haben. Ich hasse meinen Körper seit dem ich denken kann, habe einen langsamen Stoffwechsel (Unterfunktion), seit dem ich im Büro arbeite weniger Alltagsbewegung und fühle mich einfach grauenvoll. Ich habe ein „normales“ „gesundes“ Gewicht. Ich glaube ich habe einfach massive Körperwahrnehmungsstörungen. 

Angefangen durch Blogposts damals und pr0 ana content, tumblr etc hat sich im Jugendalter eine Esstörung ergeben. Seit dem ich 17 bin habe ich aber Normalgewicht. Ich trainiere aktuell 3-4 Tage die Woche, esse ausgewogen und gesund, tracke überwiegend meine Kalorien und gönne mir aber auch mal was. Ich hatte aber auch Probleme mit binge eating und generell Portionkontrolle. Also einfach alles irgendwie. Ich bin nicht dünn, nicht dick aber sehe auch nicht fit aus, finde meine Arme zu dick und bei allem gibt es was zu „optimieren“.

Aktuell kommt dazu dass ich Botox in meiner Stirnfalte will, da mein „jugendliches“ Aussehen nun gefühlt komplett weg ist und ich generell einen „bösen“ Gesichtsausdruck habe wodurch ich unsympathisch wirke. Ich hätte niemals gedacht dass ich mal solche Gedanken habe und war immer gegen solche Eingriffe, war in der Theorie ein Fan von natürlichem Altern und finde Falten bei anderen Frauen schön. Jetzt wo ich mich quasi langsam in der Situation befinde ist es plötzlich anders. Selbstzweifel, Selbsthass, ich habe das Gefühl ich erkenne mich nicht wieder. Ich bin sehr reflektiert, würde ich behaupten aber ich komme aus diesen negativen Denkmustern nicht raus aktuell. 

Ich weiß auch dass social media einen sehr großen Teil davon beeinflusst. Ich denke ständig daran wie ich wie jemand anders aussehen will, den ich im Internet gesehen habe, immer wieder.  Seit ca 15 Jahren. Den Körper, die Haut, den Style. Ich habe Tiktok gelöscht weil ich mich jedes mal dabei ertappe in diese Falle zu geraten und mein Selbsthass wird nur größer, ich rede mir ein ich gucke die Videos als Inspiration und positive Impulse, unterbewusst kommt aber nur das Gegenteil in meinem Hirn an und dann fangen die Impulskäufe an durch die man denkt man würde es damit bessern. Also genau das, was diese ganzen Medien erreichen wollen. 

Was mir sehr hilft sind Geschichten, Erfahrungen von Frauen die mit ähnlichen Dingen zu kämpfen haben. Radikale Akzeptanz. Frauen die darüber sprechen nicht den gesellschaftlichen Standards zu entsprechen. Ich kann diese ganzen künstlichen Sachen nicht mehr sehen und konsumiere gefühlt nur hohlen Content. Ich könnte noch so vieles mehr schreiben und der Text erreicht nicht ganz was ich alles aussprechen will. 

Fühlt jemand aktuell ähnlich und hat Empfehlungen? Für irgendwas?",2025-04-12 21:16:42+00:00,12,4

She seemed overall uncomfortable when I asked about side effects, and when I told her I have an allergy to something. I ended up getting 10 units into my 11s. Is this normal behavior?

1jxpt8o,PlasticSurgery,10mm sliding genioplasty 3 month update,"I've gotten a few requests for an update, so I figured the three month mark would be a good time to do it!

I ended up having to get a few units of botox in my mentalis muscle to reduce the [minor] remaining strain as it heals. It will occasionally be a little sore in the morning when I wake up, and my bottom lip is still a tad tight, but overall I don't notice it much anymore. My lower lip never lost sensation, and my chin regained it in about two weeks after surgery. My bottom teeth are still numb (though I can feel the sensation starting to come back in random places).

Sometimes I wonder if I should have just bit the bullet and followed through with jaw surgery, but it all seemed like a lot... especially at this point in my life.

All of that being said I feel like I ended up with the absolute best results I could possibly get outside of jaw surgery. I often forget how much of a difference this genioplasty made until I look at side by sides haha. I am super jazzed on how it turned it out and still feel like this is, without a doubt, one of the best decisions I've ever made :)",2025-04-12 19:52:00+00:00,3493,208

1jxou7j,MyastheniaGravis,Looking for advice from other people in my chronic illness niche!,"I am a 25 (almost 26) year old woman, I was diagnosed with MG when I was 3, had a successful thymectomy, I was on mestinon until I was about 12 and have been considered in full remission since then. I have since been diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, arthritis, sarcoidosis and psoriasis. I never know weather or not MG should be something I bring up when it comes to risk factors with other medications? Am I still just considered “in remission”? I am currently taking Skyrizi as a treatment for my Crohn’s, which of course I’m aware is a treatment for autoimmune diseases so technically if I were to have an MG flare I guess it could be masked by my Crohn’s treatment? 

I’m wondering this because my dentist recently suggested I look in to Botox for my TMJ and migraines, but of course upon googling I found there’s some risk factors for those with MG, but does that still apply to me? Am I still at risk all these years later? I hope there’s someone else in a similar situation to me that can shed some light! ",2025-04-12 19:08:41+00:00,6,3
1jxoswl,Hyperhidrosis,Best regular drug store (UK) anti-perspirant? Can't use the super strong stuff.,"I've tried all of the strong anti-perspirants like certain dri, driclor etc. and they all burn me really badly even if I only apply a small amount and follow all instructions. 

I have botox in my armpits which helps a lot but not completely, so I'm still looking for a good antiperspirant to reduce the sweating and keep me smelling fresh. 

I've always been a Mitchum powder fresh girl but I think the formula has changed in recent years and it just isn't as good anymore. 

I've been using the stick kind of anti-perspirant for the past decade or so because I don't like to use too may aerosols but recently I ran out of my usual deodorant and used my partner's spray for a few days and found I feel much dryer with that than the stick kind.

1jxo13h,Sjogrens,Thoughts on Blood Work and Symptoms,"I’m a 29 y.o. male who’s been having a lot of symptoms of Sjogren’s for a while now - possibly a decade or more. I had some concussion problems in high school around age 14-17, they weren’t serious ones but I had several in a couple of years and it took me a while to recover from them. Since then though, I’ve had chronic headaches/migraines, vestibular issues, fatigue, trouble sleeping, neck and upper back pain/tightness, TMJ and jaw tenderness, and sensitivity to light. I get trigger point injections, Botox for migraines, dry needling, and physical therapy to help manage my headaches but they still really affect my life. 

Over the last 5 or so years, I’ve also started to get other symptoms that are worsening every year: dry skin (especially my hands and face), chronic dry lips, dry mouth and increased thirst, dry eyes, and increased and urgent urination. The last one has gotten so bad the last several months that I went to a urologist, who diagnosed me with overactive bladder. 

I’ve always assumed most of these symptoms stemmed from my concussions, but my 1st cousin (23 y.o. female) was recently diagnosed with Sjogren’s, and I realized we have many of the same symptoms. Sjogren’s wouldn’t have even been on my radar if I hadn’t heard about it from her, but I’ve been pretty worried about it since. I went to a rheumatologist and he ordered a bunch of blood work, pictures of my positive results are attached. 

I haven’t followed up with the rheumatologist yet, but I feel like ANA positive with 3 other strong positives for antibodies pretty much confirms that I have some kind of autoimmune disease. What do you all think? Does Sjogren’s seem likely?",2025-04-12 18:32:39+00:00,3,4

1jxlvxl,PlasticSurgery,Can herniated facial fat pad be repositioned or should it be removed and new fat added via fat graft?,"After a horrifying year of stress and burn out and anxiety I've mostly come through to the other side. But sadly my face has not.

Either due to bruxism, weight changes (weight gain and then weight loss back to the same, only this with a higher fat percentage), or most likely with me trying to overcorrect with very strong facial massage and using an EMS device, my facial fat pads have shifted. 

Otherwise I could deal with it, but this area around my mouth and my buccal fat FEELS so strange whenever I emote and all the time I'm awake really. Basically my buccal fat area has emptied out and my perioral area especially on the right side has accumulated fat more than ever.

I really think the worst of it happened after I started trying to manipulate this area physically (from some genius source -- Reddit -- I got the thought that I could relax the muscles around my mouth and thus help the situation). My facial skin sagged and above and below my lips, especially on the right side, there is budging fat and tissue.

https://ibb.co/dwsRjL4c
https://ibb.co/9m4v41d8

The former photo pair shows how differently the skin bunches up when I smile, because there is so much tissue between my lips and the dimple area. And the dimple area is now completely hollowed out.

I am determined to get a facial fat transfer to get more fat on my face but is there a way to deal with the excess tissue also? And would it be to try to reposition it or surgically remove/reduce it?

The current situation can't go on forever because the tissue is effecting my every day facial movements. I've stopped the strong manipulating but it hasn't gotten any better since. I don't know is there hope of natural shift back if the bruxism some time gets under control? So far nothing has helped my tight right jaw, haven't tried Botox cos I'm scared of my face falling down even more.

TL;dr -- please help, can extra perioral fat be reduced at the same time as adding more fat to mid cheek and what's the best way?

1jxh1lb,migraine,Do you see double? Or have blurry focus issues? Are you always dizzy?,"This is more of a  PSA. My ocular occupational therapist said “reporting double vision is an automatic referral to a neurological ophthalmologist to check for a binocular vision dysfunction diagnosis.” 



Hmmm. Not everyone sees double?? This is literally blowing my mind. NO WONDER I’ve always been the dizziest person in whatever situation I’ve ever been in. 


I was shocked this was a thing so I am hoping more people who need this info will read it. Apparently if you feel like you have problems focusing your eyes, or you see double vision- you might have this. 


So next steps are: getting a dx. Some dx will require you to wear prism glasses which will help your eyes stay focused, and it seems like most dx will also benefit from ocular occupational therapy- to retrain your brain to interpret your eyes. 

I did confirm- “if I get this dx, am I just broken or what?” “No! We can teach you how to use binoculars vision!!” (Binocular vision is what we’re all supposed to be doing) 


It blows my mind and I’m frankly kinda pissed if took this long to get to this point. I have complained about being dizzy for years, told so many doctors, no one told me anything about this. Even while working with my vestibular rehabilitation therapist- I would daily complain about how focusing was a huge trigger and it took her 4 months to refer me to an ocular occupational therapist. It was this practitioner that likely changed the course of my life by literally almost immediately being like “oh wow you are complaining about all the things that are automatic referrals for a BVD dx” 


I’ve gone to an optometrist yearly. My mother has a very genetic eye disease and so I’ve also seen several ophthalmologists too- NO ONE has ever screened me for this. 


**For those of you who have gotten a dx- and have gotten glasses and done ocular therapy- please share your experiences!**


I have recently broken up with my manchild boyfriend (dating 2 years) and started eating gluten free and plant based and have gone from 16+ migraines a month to 1 this last month. So I’m really hoping that actually addressing this BVD might be the final nail in the coffin for being chronic for me. 



2023 I was having 25-30 a month (because of medication adaptation headache that none of my doctors told me about and in fact my doctors gave to me via prescription instructions)


All of 2024 I was in MAH recovery. Which was immediately better (10-14) but had some major setbacks with medications causing an increase in migraines (20-25) (thanks emgality and nurtec- I thought you were holy grail status..) 


2025 I started Botox and vestibular rehabilitation therapy and stopped taking any meds. Was feeling way better (8-16). Went gluten free and plant based (I don’t have any “medical sensitivities” FYI) and have had 1 the last 6 weeks. But will hopefully make a lot of gains because of this likely BVD dx. 

I say it’ll make 2026 great because I can’t get into the doc to get a dx until July. And then it will take likely several months of therapy as well. But 2026 here I fucking come! 


And to think, in 2023 when I had MAH, and didn’t realize it because sooo many doctors are so poorly informed about it they are not only giving it to their patients but also not dx or even telling them about the risk or concept of MAH..  I thought the rest of my life I would be severely disabled. I was changing my life plans entirely. And by changing I mean literally scraping every goal I’ve ever had because “how would I ever do anything with daily migraines” (obligatory link to r/reboundmigraine which literally saved my life) ",2025-04-12 13:15:12+00:00,19,32
1jxemqa,SeoulPlasticSurgery,My experience with Marble Plastic Surgery: non-incisional eyelid surgery + ptosis correction,"Hi everyone! Yesterday I shared a photo of my healing progress after non-incisional eyelid surgery. I’d like to share a full review of the clinic and my overall experience as an international patient.

**Booking consults and communication:**

I heard about Marble Plastic Surgery from a Youtube video someone shared about her experience. I really liked her results and that's what made me consider going to them. I reached out through WhatsApp and they responded so fast! It was within minutes. They were so forthcoming with all the details which to me was a good sign. This was my first major surgery and time having any cosmetic work done so I had a ton of questions. The surgeon took a look at my photos that I submitted and gave me a pre-diagnosis with a price estimate for both the incisional and non-incisional method with the ptosis correction.

After having messaged with multiple plastic surgery offices, I really appreciated that they didn’t try to push any unnecessary procedures on me. One clinic had recommended a rhinoplasty along with a whole list of other treatments, which honestly put me off. I was glad to find a place that focused on what I actually needed, without trying to upsell me on anything.

**Consultation with Dr Suh Yong Hoon and pricing:**

First impressions of the office were great. It had a clean, welcoming atmosphere, and I immediately felt comfortable walking in. This might be odd, but when I visit offices for consultations, I always pay attention to how the staff looks. Not to judge in a negative way but I assume that if they’ve had work done, it’s typically by the surgeons I’ll be consulting with, so I like to assess and I feel like it gives me an idea of what to expect. If the results look unnatural or too extreme, it’s a red flag for me. Everyone here looked stunning and natural, which is what I was wanting for myself.

My consultation with Dr. Suh lasted maybe 20 minutes, but I never felt rushed. He really took the time to understand what I wanted, even showing me different eyelid shapes to help me visualize the options. His approach was incredibly thoughtful and patient, which gave me a lot of confidence in his expertise.

Going into the consultation, I had assumed I would need incisional eyelid surgery to address the hooding of my eyes. However, Dr. Suh recommended that I was a good candidate for the non-incisional method instead, which was a huge relief. I had received conflicting advice from other surgeons—two different clinics suggested I also consider a brow lift along with the eyelid surgery. I know it’s common to combine a brow lift with an upper blepharoplasty, but I wasn’t mentally prepared to do anything more than my eyelids, so I was a bit thrown off when the other surgeons mentioned it. I was open to the idea, but I really appreciated that Dr. Suh didn’t push it when I asked about it. He listened carefully to my preference for a subtle, natural change, and focused on just evening out the hooding of my eyes.

In the end we agreed on the non-incisional double eyelid surgery and ptosis correction. I had already secured my surgery date when I initially booked the consultation, three weeks prior. To lock in the date, I had put down 10% of the procedure cost, which was a bit of a gamble since I hadn’t met the surgeon in person yet. I felt good about the clinic though and if things didn’t work out, I was prepared to eat the cost. During the consultation, they went over pricing again, which was consistent with what I had received on WhatsApp—no surprises there. The cost for the non-incisional method, plus ptosis correction, was quoted at 2.5 million won, but with an early-bird discount for booking in advance, I ended up paying only 2.12 million won.

**Surgery day:**

My surgery was scheduled for 11am the next day. All I had to do to prepare for it was fast for 4 hours before surgery. When I arrived at the clinic, they had me change, wash my face, and then I met with the surgeon. He marked out the final design on my face, and this was my last chance to address any concerns before the procedure. It was also the moment to see exactly where the sutures would be placed.

When he marked my eyes the first time, I felt that it wasn’t exactly even. Don’t hesitate to speak up if something doesn’t look or feel right—this is your face! We're not messing around. I expressed to him my feelings and asked him to redo it, and he was more than happy to do so. My friend, who was with me, even took some photos from different angles so I could see it better too. That made a huge difference in helping me feel more confident about the final result.

From here we made our way to the operating room to get prepped for the procedure. I was extremely nervous but having my translator really helped ease my nerves—she had the same procedure with the same surgeon, so hearing about her experience made a huge difference. It was such a comfort to have that personal reference moments before having mine done. She stayed with me in the operating room until I went under the IV sedation, explaining everything they were doing every step of the way. I really appreciated that!

Once the sedation kicked in, I was completely out of it. I was somewhat aware, but I didn’t feel any pain, just some light tugging here and there, nothing unbearable though. It was an odd experience because I was aware of everything happening, but I felt so calm and at ease about it. The surgeon had me open and close my eyes to check for symmetry once he was finished, and I was most nervous about this part. I thought it would hurt or freak me out to see myself in the operating room, but it was actually fine—no pain at all. Luckily, everything looked even, and that was the last step of the procedure. In total, it took about 40 minutes to complete.

As soon as I was fully awake and ready to head to the recovery room, my translator was right there, like she hadn’t left at all. I iced my eyes for about 15 minutes, and then she gave me the green light to get dressed and leave. I felt great—no dizziness or nausea (thankfully!). Before I left, they gave me a goody bag with everything I needed—gauze, an ice pack for my eyes, and my prescriptions. The clinic has a pharmacy downstairs, so it was really convenient to just head right down and pick up all my meds without any hassle.

I felt well enough to walk around, so my friend and I went out to eat and then took the train back to our Airbnb. When I got home I iced my eyes, watched movies, and took micro-naps throughout the day to recover. It was a pretty chill day one.

**Post-surgery care and recovery process:**

Honestly, it was almost too easy. The first 2-3 days, I was the most swollen, but it didn’t stop me from going about my day and even went out to do some sightseeing. I was really consistent with icing for the first 3 days. I did 10-15 minutes every hour. I also made sure to stay hydrated and eat like normal. Your body needs nourishment right now and I wanted a quick recovery so I was set on doing everything I could to make that happen.

I didn’t wash my face completely until day 5. For the first 3-4 days, I gently cleaned the surgical sites using contact solution and a cotton swab. By day 5, I felt comfortable enough to wash my whole face, but I made sure to be extra careful around my eyes and used a gentle cleanser. On days 4 and 5, I also switched to using a warm compress since my bruising seemed more prominent than the swelling. I did this 2-3 times a day.

**Post-Surgery Care at the Clinic:**

I had a follow-up appointment 7 days after my procedure and it went smoothly. I was really happy with how well I was healing, so it was a quick check up. My friend also had some procedures done this same week, so I ended up spending more time at Marble for her consults, surgery day, and check ups. One of the days, they offered me a complimentary 6-minute red light therapy session to help with swelling and healing. I wasn’t expecting that at all!

**Final thoughts:**

The English translators here are exceptional—truly the best of the best! I can't thank them enough. They’re incredible and one of the main reasons I’ll continue coming back for treatments whenever I’m in South Korea. They were so kind, friendly, and relatable. I really appreciated how they shared their own personal surgery experiences with the surgeons there, which helped ease my nerves throughout the process. They genuinely go out of their way to make you feel safe and supported.

It’s been 15 days since my surgery, and my eyes look pretty much the same as they did on day 12—everything has healed so well. I’d be more than happy to share additional photos for anyone who’s curious about the results. Overall, I’m so glad I went through with it and have absolutely zero regrets. If you're considering double eyelid surgery in South Korea, I highly recommend Marble. I plan to come back next year and will be going to them for my Botox and other skincare treatments.

I need some advice to help treat this.

So I’ve showered everyday, washed well, dried well, and even put baby powder on. I’ve tried antidepressants, Botox, and Drysol. None seem to help.

1jxbwuu,hyperacusis,I read the latest research on hyperacusis so you don't have to,"First of all, I am not a clinician, nor a research. I am a public health professional with hyperacusis so this information is of a general nature.

* **Recommended Treatments (Safe to Try or Potentially Beneficial)**
   * **Paracetamol**: May provide some relief ([MedRxiv, 2024](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.19.24309185v1.full)).
   * **TMJ-Specific Treatments** (Splints, Physical Therapy, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and Botox): These may offer some relief **or** no benefit but will not ordinarily worsen symptoms, making them safer options to explore ([MedRxiv, 2024](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.19.24309185v1.full)).
* **Treatments that are a gamble (Ineffective or Potentially Harmful)** 
   * **Sound Exposure Therapies** (Hearing Aids, Sound Therapy, or Tinnitus Retraining Therapy): Research suggests that hearing aid amplification can increase loudness tolerance by reducing auditory gain, with studies showing increased loudness discomfort levels (LDLs) and higher acoustic reflex thresholds after just one week of unilateral hearing aid use (Munro & Merrett, 2013; Munro & Trotter, 2006; Munro et al., 2007). Jastreboff asserts that hyperacusis can often be treated with desensitization, potentially leading to full remission within months (Jastreboff, 2011), and a 2022 review supports that sound therapy can restore LDLs to normal in some cases ([Henry, 2022](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7151-0652)). Additionally, Baguley highlights that gradual desensitization is effective for most patients (Baguley & McFerran, 2011). **However, while they can sometimes improve hyperacusis, they also pose a risk of worsening symptoms**, especially in pain hyperacusis. Case studies like[ Brian’s story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1oXlQQnKHQ&list=WL&index=20&ab_channel=HyperacusisCentral) and[ Sedrob’s story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfGvM9OPFQk&list=WL&index=21&ab_channel=HyperacusisCentral) illustrate these risks. Research suggests that sound therapy may be more beneficial for loudness hyperacusis (22.4% reported improvement) than for pain hyperacusis (only 4.4% improved), but worsening symptoms occurred in 27.5% of pain hyperacusis patients and 18.4% of loudness hyperacusis patients ([PMC8642094](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8642094/)). Not recommended for misophonia either, as it lacks evidence of effectiveness ([Duke Psychiatry](https://psychiatry.duke.edu/sites/default/files/2023-05/treatment_of_misophonia.pdf)).
   * **Benzodiazepines**: While perceived as beneficial across all hyperacusis types, their use remains controversial and they carry risks of dependency and side effects. They should only be considered when conservative treatments and sound therapy have failed ([Jufas & Wood, 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25622905/)).
   * **Gabapentinoids and Opioids**: Reported as beneficial specifically for pain hyperacusis, suggesting they may help with nociceptive symptoms ([PMC8642094](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8642094/)) but their use remains controversial because they carry risks of dependency and side effects
   * **Any other pharmaceutical or non pharmaceutical treatment including the Silverstein Surgery, Cannabis, or Antidepressants**: No consistent evidence of effectiveness ([MedRxiv, 2024](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.19.24309185v1.full)).",2025-04-12 07:33:43+00:00,25,14

1jxb1f3,Esthetics,Unprofessional behavior in the industry is super frustrating,"I’ll preface this by saying I’m an experienced esthetician, and just got my electrology license. Apologies in advance if this seems out of place or if I’m just in the wrong but I feel like I’m going crazy. I’ve been on the job search since then, and have encountered SEVERAL spas and medspas that literally have just ghosted me. 
One place I had an interview at said the team had a very positive reaction to me, asked me to come back for a practical. Not only did I come back for the practical, but once I arrived at the spa, they were completely unprepared for me to do a practical (thankfully I had my own products and supplies) and didn’t have a room available for me to do it in (had to kick out another esti so I could use the room)?! Please anyone let me know if this is normal?
Another place reached out to me after I applied and asked for a video interview and when the video interview didn’t work out, they said they would call instead (not sure why I couldn’t just have the interview in person). Well, not only did they never call but they left all my messages on read when I was trying to reschedule for another interview.
From all of these places, not even a text or a call post interview. I would even be happy if they just sent a text saying we decided to go with someone else but thanks for your time. Am I going crazy or is this insanely unprofessional? And I’m running into it so much. So frustrating and very discouraging. ",2025-04-12 06:31:51+00:00,61,25

1jx8ncy,PlasticSurgery,Cheek filler after weight loss,"I have been STRUGGLING with loss of volume in my face after 72lbs of weight loss and I was really depressed about my nasolabial folds. Everything just looked so droopy and gaunt in my cheeks.
I had three consultations to address my concerns, the first tried to sell me on 7800 dollars worth of Botox and filler and said he didn’t want to touch my cheeks but wanted to inject me everywhere else.
The second also didn’t suggest cheeks but wanted to put two vials of Juvaderm in my folds.

Ultimately I ended up at the most amazing office with a provider who took a very long time talking with me about my options and goals, highlighted all the things we like about my face rather than focused on strictly what I dislike, recommended a slow and conservative approach with minimal Botox as an introduction and we chose to do injections in my cheeks to restore volume with the expectation that the fullness will reduce the severity of my nasolabial folds and that’s what we went with! 
One vial between both cheeks and the results are subtle and natural looking and I am really thrilled.
This photo is during my session, the right side of this photo is the side with filler and left is without. I can’t wait to see how things look over the next week.

One night she drank a lot (not an uncommon occurence), proceded to scream and cuss me out for about 5-6 hours straight, spit on my face a couple times, and punched my shoulder (which did bruise). I lost it after the 6th hour and I slapped her like 3 times, I'll admit it. But I begged her to leave me alone, I don't have a lock on my bedroom door, and the car is hers so I had nowhere to go to be away from her. After the 3rd slap, she told me she was going to st*b me if I hit her again. And I stopped fighting and just put a chair against my door and slept in my room for the night. She leaves that morning to stay with her mom and calls me saying a cop called her saying somebody called a tip in saying she was abusing me and she should be locked up. I didn't tell anyone about this at the time, I think it was likely a neighbor since we live in a condo with very close neighbors who walk their dogs out at odd hours for bathroom times. Now my family is pissed thinking I did it and I'm sabotaging my mother. She says she was just kidding about the st*b thing, and lied to everyone saying I made her face that swollen (she had a botox treatment that very day and it was swelling when she got home already, it wasn't me since I never really hit her that hard, it was just self defense).

She has spent the past year being very embarrassed at school because her throat always made growling sounds, especially after she ate or drank anything. She got botox almost 3 weeks ago and her condition has gone from bad to worse! Not only does her throat still make growling sounds, but she also burps almost every time she opens her mouth! If she yawns, coughs, or laughs, she burps excessively. She plays soccer and when she's running, she burps. She cannot control it and it's affecting her, mentally. Has anyone else experienced this, and if so, did anything help? The Dr says it will just take time for everything to calm down, but we were never told that she might go from no burping to constant burping. She received 50 units of botox.

Looking to buy a larger home and shes just been nasty to me all the time, I cut her off during a discussion not on purpose I thought she was done and she started yelling at me about how I asked for divorce and was suicidal a month ago. I was under a lot of stress and depressed because I work so hard for us, am a present father (I get the kids up and if they run down hall or wake her up she wakes in a sour mood and treats me like shit) I typically make their breakfast before I leave. All these things she has said would make her happy but I think she won't ever be happy she lives in fear and anxiety no matter what I do, I have been seeing a counselor myself and paying 160 a session 4 to 6 times a week for marriage counseling for 6 months. She had never really been accountable for her behavior it's always what I did or my reaction to her condescending talk . Honestly I got to a place where I accepted that I am a good man and father regardless of what sh3 says and now I'm only here because of hope she will see the damage and division she's causing because she won't even acknowledge resentment towards me she says she's forgiven me but I can see that's not the case , anything I do she doesn't like is met with a sigh and disgusted sentiment as if I'm an annoyance. I can't get her to see it and I'm ready to file paperwork and let her see once I'm gone. I'm over 6 ft, attractive, a good dad, and make over 160k a year with a flexible schedule and my own business. I don't want to be with anyone else I want my family together but I'm tired of pouring everything I have into this bottomless pit of negativity and ridicule. The rubbing my face in something personal I shared with her was the eye opener to she doesn't love me at all. I would never tell her something like "" you were ready to commit suicide a month ago"" if I didn't hate her. It's crazy bit I want her to be how she thinks she is but it's obvious it's not true. I'm scared to pull the trigger but since I got out of treatment  in May 22 she hasn't looked at me the same and I've improved in every way, I'm trying to feel good about that and I do but after the work day coming home to the craziness is killing me.

The only thing that helps is just going to sleep and then I wake up and feel fine. Constant bloating, chest pressure, gurgling noises & all the other symptoms that come along with RCPD. 

My job requires me to be on a mic speaking for long periods of time & I am curious if people had a hard time speaking for prolonged periods of time after Botox and if so how long it lasted. It also is something that requires me to move my body a lot so wondering if acid reflux is going to be a hard thing for me post Botox. Any advice would be great or just hearing other people’s experiences. Also super nervous about the uncontrollable burping that happens about 4 weeks in (what I was told from my doctor) and wondering if this is something that really does happen that I need to be cautious of. 

Genuinely hoping this can help me feel better and live what seems like a normal life being able to go to dinners/lunches and not feel horrible stomach and chest pain afterwards. I feel like it just feels normal now after dealing with it the past few years but I don’t want it to be normal so hoping my first round helps me figure it out.

My recovery has been totally horrendous, the first night I got to my accommodation I vomitted the entire night. Then the past 2 days my swelling is incredibly bad. My whole head is blown up into a balloon and feels a bit hard. I'm on Day 5 today, and swelling only started to lessen a bit, but my head is still huge and I'm still puffed up, though my face feels less hard. 
My hairline is still so high up and head feels so numb. 

I visited the clinic everyday, and they dont seem to be worried, or I feel like they're just trying not to make me panic. I feel like they downplayed a lot how the recovery will be :( As from my research, this kind of swelling usually happen more from more intense surgeries like bone shaving or a facelift? 

I'm so worried :(  Has anyone else have this experience during recovery before? Especially with a forehead lift? 

For a long time I wanted to get my deviated septum and my very low eyelids fixed.. And thought I needed a forehead lift, which the clinic convinced me I needed as well. Now I'm really losing my mind about it and thinking what have I done..

I want my skin to look as glowy as possible. I’m looking for product as well as treatment recs. My standard routine is below, with places indicated where I am looking for product recs:

*=looking for alternative product recs 

Morning: cleanse, CeraVe vitamin C serum, The Ordinary natural moisturizing factors + HA*, Krave Beauty sunscreen*

Evening: cleanse, serum varies (*just finished a Kate Somerville retinol so looking for a new product in this realm…also have Lancôme Genefique but just haven’t been in love with it for the price), then usually the same Ordinary moisturizer bc I’ve been trying to kill it

I also use eye cream here and there but admittedly am not great about it…

So in sum I’m in the market for 
-new moisturizer- would love something really rich especially for at night. I like feeling that glazed donut vibe 
-new sunscreen, especially one that doesn’t smell sunscreeny and is gentle on eyes 
-some sort of retinol-type serum 
-would take anti aging eye product recs as well 

I also been wanting to get into some facial treatments on a monthly-ish basis, but have felt overwhelmed at the different options and have no idea where to start. I don’t see myself getting into Botox or filler but am willing to try/pay for things as long as my skin looks reasonably presentable again in ~48 hours (I.e., I wouldn’t want something intense with a long recovery time). I just booked a hydra facial for the first time. I have also thought about dermaplaning because I am sort of fuzzy in that blonde type way but I’m nervous I won’t like it!

1jwz8n5,achalasia,My Achalasia Journey,"Hi everybody! I wanted to post my full Achalasia journey to help anybody now and in the future who might be curious about the timeline from symptoms to diagnosis to surgery. For context, I’m a 25 year old Canadian male.

Around 2021 I noticed I couldn’t swallow starchy foods very well. I stupidly attributed this symptom to the fact that I was undergoing Invisalign treatments at the time and that it changed the way I chewed foods. I pretty much ignored/pushed past the symptoms until November 2024.

At this point I’m already consciously avoiding bread, rice, noodles, chewy meats, pretty much anything that takes more than a few chews to get down. I decided it was time to take these symptoms a bit more seriously and reached out to my family doctor for a referral to a local chewing and swallowing clinic.

From referral to the actual appointment was about 3 weeks. They did a barium swallow but only examined how I chewed foods and how it went past my upper esophagus. My first mistake was that this clinic didn’t examine anything past the upper esophagus. I was able to ask for just one scan of how the food looks at the lower esophageal area for curiosity’s sake and it showed the “birds beak” formation indicative of Achalasia.

My family doctor received the scans later and called me urgently to discuss the results. She said that the birds beak appearance worried her deeply about my condition and sent an urgent referral to a local G.I. For an endoscopy. At this time it’s around the last week of December, so I didn’t expect to get an appointment for another month or so. Luckily, despite being on holiday, the GI receiving my referral called me a few days later to set up an endoscopy. Luckily again, there was a cancellation and I could get an endoscopy a few days later into the New Year.

At this point it’s January 2025, my symptoms are worsening at a rate faster than ever. I struggle to swallow any non-pureed foods and even liquids are starting to feel “stuck” at the bottom of my esophagus. I get my endoscopy done in the first week of January, it was a quick procedure but provided little clarity on my condition. The endoscopist said there was no damage to my esophagus, no widening at the base (typical of Achalasia patients) and no GERD damage. The only abnormal thing was that my esophagus had a large pool of fluid. The endoscopist recommends a Manometry test to confirm Achalasia. The clinic I’m referred to says it’ll be a 3 month wait for a Manometry test which is incredibly disheartening to hear as I can tell my symptoms are getting worse at an unmanageable rate. I asked the receptionist to be put on a cancellation list and luckily, a spot had opened up for the following week (second week of January)

The Manometry test seemed to be the biggest hurdle, since it had to be done while fully conscious. However the results that came out of it were more valuable than ever. I had officially received a Type I Achalasia diagnosis. The test showed zero esophageal motility and increased pressure near my lower esophageal sphincter. Now that I finally received the results I needed, I could finally be recommended for surgery. The results were sent back to my GI as I awaited a follow-up call.

The timeline between mid-January and late-February is the absolute worst of my Achalasia symptoms. I had lost about 35 pounds, and was now only able to reliably keep down liquids (protein shakes) and some congee. I was unable to get an uninterrupted nights sleep without regurgitating fluids/foam/food/stomach acid. One day, at the end of February, I realized I could no longer keep down liquids either, as I’d immediately regurgitate it. I was told by a number of doctors that if I ever reached this point then I should go to the nearest emergency room. After about a 1.5 day long stay at the ER, explaining my symptoms and what would help, I was luckily able to get an emergency Botox injection by the GI team at the hospital. 

The Botox injection helped me get back about 60% of my ability to swallow which I was more than grateful for. By the end of February I had finally received a call from my GI to schedule my POEM, which was to be done on April 9th, 2025. My symptoms up until then were manageable, with a few regurgitation episodes.

I’m writing this post as I await a post-op appointment for something unrelated to the Achalasia. My POEM went smoothly and so far the only issue is some heartburn.

Here are some key takeaways from my experience:

1. The worsening symptoms I described around December 2024 were likely brought on by unrelated to life factors. It’s common for high stressors to worsen Achalasia symptoms. Nevertheless I’m thankful since it pushed me to get an official answer to my swallowing problems

2. I recognize that I had an extremely good streak of luck with my diagnosis and test timeline. Most people take months to get an endoscopy and Manometry test but I was able to have it done within a month. The only thing I can say is to ask (nicely) to be put on a cancellation list for your appointments as that’s how I got all my appointments done.

3. Be transparent about your condition with your friends, family, and colleagues at work. I sincerely believe my struggle would’ve been 10x worse had I not been so open about my diagnosis and struggles. Everybody was very accommodating and helpful and a strong support system can help both physically and mentally. Support I received from this subreddit also helped immensely (hence the reason I’m posting here to help others)


I sincerely hope that the information in this post can provide some clarity to present/future Achalasia patients. I encourage anyone to reach out through Reddit DMs/comments if they have any questions about my journey or Achalasia in general.

I’ve seen a few different medical spas and injectors for consults. One recommend PRP under eye treatments. Another recommended half a syringe of filler in the top part of each cheek. Since the hallows/wrinkles are most noticeable when I smile, she believes this placement will add more volume and keeps me from having to get undereye filler which often migrates. A third med spa recommended the Morpheus8 treatment which is RF/microneedling in one, intended to stimulate collagen and tighten skin.

All of these treatments are costly so I’d like to try one that is inclined to get me the best results. I’m attaching pics where I’ve circled the problem areas and am open to all suggestions - whether you agree with any that have been recommended to me, or if there’s another treatment that would be worth a try. 

For reference, I have already tried crows feet and jelly roll Botox and there was no discernible difference in the area I circled.

1jwumhg,TMJ,How long did your muscle stiffness/spams/pain last after masseter botox? (botox side effect),"I'm on day 5 and the stiffness and spasms are inane. My entire neck front and back is so so stiff. Oral surgeon injected just my masseters. Neck, front and back, cheeks feel weird, chewing and talking makes stiffness worse. Weird feeling as if it's not my face or something. Hard to explain. Dizzyness. Pressure around the eyes. And yesterday I had a fever. I googled and fever after botox seemed to be a common side effect. No fever today. But I didn't experience that with my first 3 rounds before. And same surgeon injected. Same botox being used. 

Last round was in Sept 2024, so it helped me for 6 months. Which I feel is a long time and it's been amazing. It's the only thing that has made my tmjd manageble.

I had soreness and stiffness as well with the other rounds. But this one seems pretty extreme. Including the fever. I've been exhausted the entire month so maybe that's why I respond so heavy.

My masseters grew back to full strength after 6 months and my headaches came back with a vengeance so I really needed another round. And after just 2 days my headaches are gone. 

My neck and jaw muscles seem so tight, I can't even move my face to the right. Also have shoulder tightness and sternum tightness. Overal my reaction to it this time seems intense. Even the back of my skull is tight! I'm constantly massaging the back of my skull. Breathing even feels tight. Although I know it's a muscle thing, my oxygen levels are fine. 

Can anyone relate to these side effects? I must say that with simple dry needling by my PT I also had severe muscle tightness and spasms after jaw dry needling. Which felt similar. That's why I quit them cause they didn't help. And those were just 2 or 3 needles in total. Oral surgeon injected quite a few in my masseters. 60 units in total. 30 each side. He keeps telling me that it won't work if we do less. All I know is that this amount surely worked with the other 3 rounds. 
Every 6 months can't be too much botox? He said wait at least 4. And I've stretched it to 6.

Anyone can relate? Last round the tightness and spasms started right after botox injections and lasted 1.5 weeks. This time I had no spasms and tightness afterwards but they started 2 days later. ",2025-04-11 16:52:06+00:00,3,3

My neuro told me she has never seen that side effect, and I wondered if anyone else has had something similar happen to them. I ask mostly out of curiosity and also because I've been recommended botox for another medical condition and I'm extremely reluctant, based on my bad experience.

1jwt8s0,noburp,8 days post-botox - any advice appreciated,"It has been 8 days since my Botox procedure (75 units) and I’m hoping for a bit of advice/reassurance. 

I’ve had pretty bad slow swallow symptoms for 7 days now and I’m starting to get really disheartened by only being able to handle liquids. I was hoping I’d see some incremental improvements but no luck. I can see from other recent posts I’m not alone there so my thoughts are with everyone who is going through it right now!

Anyone else who had a bad time with slow swallow, did you just have to push through and force food down or did you wait for it to get better? I’m a bit worried about how long I can sustain such a low calorie diet. 

I have this other weird symptom the last two days which is almost like the base of my throat feels like it has been stretched open - it’s really uncomfortable and painful at times. Has anyone else felt this?

My Doctor said as long as I’m not in serious pain there’s nothing to worry about but I’m a pretty anxious person so was hoping to get a bit more insight into other people’s experiences. I know it’ll vary by person but if anyone has had a similar experience or any advice to share I’d really appreciate it - I’m feeling a bit low at the moment not knowing when these symptoms are going to end.

1jwsdu4,TMJ,Trigger point vs Dry Needling - which one helped more?,"I have a relentless knot in my TMJ that nothing seems to get rid of. 

I have done physical therapy for years, regularly do yoga and Pilates, have a mouth guard that I wear, take a muscle relaxer and Motrin, get intra oral and upper body massages every couple months, get Botox for migraines that has been injected into my TMJ several times and got trigger point injections in my upper shoulder on the affected side. The pain specialist I saw does not do trigger point for TMJ. 

The massage therapist I see recommended I get dry needling and I have an appointment coming up in a couple weeks to get the TMJ trigger point injections done under ultrasound by another provider. My insurance will “likely” cover 80%. 

TLDR: For those who have had both trigger point and dry needling which one did you find the most helpful? If you’ve had one versus the other - did you find relief?

1jwf0zu,AITAH,"My dentist broke my night guard. I said they need to replace it for me, free of charge. AITAH?","I have been waking up with jaw soreness and stiffness in the mornings for about a year. Since January, I believe this has gotten worse. 

I wear my custom night guard religiously every single night. I got this in 2019 for grinding/clenching. I take excellent care of it - cleaning and letting it air dry during the day. 

On Monday, I visited the dentist to have a conversation about possible solutions. Botox, new night guard, anything. I just wanted to talk options. 

She said do a bunch of jaw exercises, we’ll also adjust your night guard and come back in a few weeks to see how it’s going. I said ok. 

Well, the dental assistant adjusted my night guard and grind it down to almost nothing. I said “wow it’s really thin now!?” And she said “if there’s any problems we can just order a new one.” I didn’t think it was that bad. Maybe I would wear it down after a few weeks or months.  

Next morning there’s two holes in it. It’s unusable. I can see how THIN she made my night guard. 

I called the dentist the next morning (Tuesday) and they said they’ll cover 50% of the cost for a new night guard. I said that’s unacceptable. It’s because of you that my night guard is unusable now?!

The secretary I spoke to was very defensive about the whole thing and it really put me off. She said she’ll talk to the dentist and get back to me. It is now Thursday evening; they haven’t answered me yet and I called them around noon today…

AITAH? How I was raised, if I am responsible for breaking something that does not belong to me, I replace it. It doesn’t matter if I was not the one who broke it. If I borrowed someone’s tool and wore it down so much that it broke during the next use, I am responsible. 

I understand the night guard needed adjustment. The problem I have is, should the DA really have ground it SO much?! I am completely open to buying a new night guard. But I never said I wanted to get rid of my old one. ",2025-04-11 02:07:46+00:00,15,23
1jwes31,AcneScars,Before and after - 6 months after deep chemical peel and tca cross,"I've been trying to treat my acne scars all my life - in the past I've tried 3x deep C02 ( no results) , 2xsubsicion followed by an RF laser treatment ( some improvement), multiple rounds of Morpheus treatment ( some improvement) and a whole bunch of micro needling sessions at a medspa.

The before photo here is after all this and I still didn't feel good about my skin so I decided to get a deep chemical peel along with tca cross. The after pic is after 6 months from this procedure. I think this had the most significant improvement from all my treatments though I won't lie the downtime was horrible ( more than 5  months of looking severely sunburnt, and I still have some redness), but I think it was worth it. The scars are still there but they're softer somehow. Still not perfect, and I keep debating whether to do more tca cross treatments, I just hate the downtime though. I'm 42, South Asian, my skin generally takes time to recover from hyperpigmentation so that makes the deep peel longer to heal. 
Lighting is unfortunately not exactly the same.. before pics were taken at the doctor's office which is a long drive out for me, the after was at a different clinic which I felt had similar lighting.

1jweddc,asianamercianytsnark,Ellenor Kim,"She’s always complaining about how hard it is being an influencer. She’s whining that IG pushes out reels over stories and how it takes her a day to make a reel. Well.. it is your job, you talk about influencing as a job, so.. shouldn’t it be something comparable to a 9 to 5? Her saying she prefers stories because it’s easier… DUH LMAO she’s always wanting to do the bare minimum yet expects so much growth. 

She’s constantly pushing out the same shitty content (Amazon hauls, weird scalp products) while always looking very Botox-y and irritated.. 

I used to love her content pre-covid but now everything feels so fake, so forced. When will she wake up to realize she’s not meant to be an influencer? ",2025-04-11 01:33:09+00:00,17,5
1jwe5o7,noburp,Anxious about Botox because of Emetephobia,"Idk when I’ll get the Botox, but the main thing that worries me about it is that I’ll be able to vomit. Last time I threw up was about 8 years ago, when I was 14. Since then I’ve gotten food poisoning, drank too much etc and not been able to. I thought it was odd then moved on until last year where for about a month I felt rlly hungry but couldn’t eat much of anything, with random bouts of nausea. Never been able to burp. Did my research, got to this. 

I’m not worried the Botox will cause me to throw up, I’m more worried that when I inevitably catch a bug or eat something wrong, I’ll actually be able to throw stuff up now. Whist it’s been uncomfortable, and I still hate the feeling, I do weirdly get some small comfort when I feel sick knowing that there’s a decent chance nothing will be able to come out. I know that symptoms get worse as I age, but Idk im just worried that I’ll be able to go through it normally again. I’ve always hated it, and I can’t tell if that’s because of RCPD or not. As far as I’m aware I was able to throw up normally when I was a young kid. I still hated it back then. That time when I was 14 was the first time I remember struggling. Is throwing up after Botox easier? Does it still hurt your chest?",2025-04-11 01:21:41+00:00,11,12
1jwdwma,migraine,Debilitating neck pain after migraine,"I’ve seen a lot of people talking about getting neck and shoulder pain before or during their migraines, but has anyone found relief from extreme neck and shoulder pain that occur postdrome? 

I have migraine episodes 1-2 times every month, and for the last 2 years I’ve been experiencing sharp, burning nerve-like pain from behind the top of my ear to the middle of my shoulder. It’s always on the left side, and it comes with stiffness and tension. It lasts anywhere from a few days to weeks, and it’s always after the actual migraine is gone. It completely ruins my life. Even lying down, unmoving, the natural shifts from simple things like breathing are unbelievably painful. I can’t function, cant turn my head or look up/down, talk, etc. without burning pain. Over time, it’s caused chronic muscle tension. I’ve tried regular chiropractic care for months, acupuncture, PT and gentle stretching, and a barrage of muscle relaxers/pain meds/steroids to try and help get rid of it. I’ve had x-rays and MRIs, but they always turn up bupkis. I’m on Rizatriptan for the actual migraines, and it has helped stop them almost as soon as they start 70% of the time. I’ve even tried continuing to take it, thinking maybe the stiffness could be helped by repeat dosages..

I’m at the end of my rope, the pain regularly has me in tears and I feel so useless. I can be fine for a week or two, and then it’s suddenly back. My left shoulder/neck area is so chronically knotted by all these episodes that I’ve had massage therapists tell me “This is too severe and I can’t help you”. I cant find anything that’s made a difference; I’d love to try Botox but I’m having so much trouble getting it approved by insurance. Has anyone dealt with this and found a light at the end of their tunnel? ",2025-04-11 01:08:14+00:00,5,1
1jwdvzg,CerebralPalsy,Any good CP doctors in the SFL Area?,"My boyfriend is 31M and has spastic hemiplegia on his left side. For the last 3 years, he’s had a headache virtually every day, chronic, borderline debilitating pain, and no one here in this area seems to be able to or want to help. We’ve done so many different treatments, from massage therapy, PT, tizanidine, and at home/natural remedies, but nothing seems to take away his pain despite slight improvements to his muscle ability. We recently tried Botox and haven’t seen any results yet, and he’s at his wits end. We do daily stretching and exercise to alleviate the symptoms. 

Does any one here have any recommendations for where we can go to get some actual CP support? This is a Hail Mary for us and I want to be able to help him.

She also shot her face up with filler and Botox which from experience I know cost over $1,000. 

I find it interesting that whenever there are things that she says her kids need she somehow is poor and unable to afford any of it. 
Every. Single. Time. Seems a bit fishy to me. 

And she also has absolutely NO clue what being a successful real estate agent entails. 

She clearly thinks that she will get her license and just instantly sell a bunch of houses and make a bunch of money. A lot of hard work and dedication needs to be put into this career. And it takes a LONG TIME to start making real money. Which is why it is suggested that you have another job or source of income when you first start out. 

I think it’s funny but not shocking that she changed her Instagram bio and wrote “Future real estate agent and investor” in TN. Putting the cart in front of the horse like always. She hasn’t even taken the damn test and is calling herself an agent and just assumes she will be a successful one. I doubt she will pass even the test. ",2025-04-10 23:51:18+00:00,6,1

*   **Beware of ‍""Too Good⁤ to Be True"" Deals:** If a deal seems too good to be ⁢true, it probably⁣ is. Be wary of clinics that offer extremely low prices or unrealistic promises. These clinics may be using outdated technology, unqualified technicians, or unethical practices.

## Preparing for Your Laser Hair Removal Treatment

Once you've ⁤found a clinic and scheduled your appointment, here are some tips to prepare for your laser hair‌ removal treatment:

*   **Avoid Sun Exposure:**⁢ Avoid sun‍ exposure and tanning for at least two weeks ⁢before your⁤ treatment. Sunburned or tanned skin can increase the risk of side effects.

*   **Shave the Treatment Area:** Shave the treatment area 24-48 hours before your appointment. ⁤This allows the laser to target⁣ the hair follicle directly without burning the hair on the surface of the skin.

*   **Avoid Waxing, Plucking, and Electrolysis:** Avoid waxing, plucking, and electrolysis for at​ least ⁤four weeks before your treatment. These methods remove the hair follicle, which is the target ⁢of the laser.*   **Avoid Certain‌ Medications and Products:** Certain medications and skincare products can increase your skin's sensitivity to the laser. Discuss your current medications and skincare routine⁢ with your technician during your consultation.

*   **wear Loose-Fitting Clothing:** Wear loose-fitting clothing to your appointment to avoid irritating the treated area after your treatment.

## Understanding What to Expect During and After⁣ treatment.

Understanding the procedure reduces anxiety. During the ⁤session, expect the technician to cleanse the area.You'll wear protective eyewear. The laser device is then used, which might feel like a rubber band snap. Sessions vary in duration based⁤ on area⁤ size.

Post-treatment redness and slight ⁢swelling are common. Apply a cold compress, avoid sun exposure, and use sunscreen religiously. The skin typically heals in a few days. Expect treated hair to shed over ⁤the ⁤following weeks; consistent sessions produce noticeable long-term results. Before and after pictures are helpful. People search ""laser hair removal before and after⁤ near me"" to understand expectations.

1jw946w,Insurance,Botox for Migraines,"I recently had a doctor’s visit wherein I was given Botox injections to aid with migraines. When looking up the cost ahead of time, I was told that with insurance the cost was typically $200, and without insurance it was about $600. I’ve just received the bill from my health insurance provider, and according to them, they covered approximately $2000 of the procedure which leaves me paying $750. That’s more than even the estimate WITHOUT insurance. I’m not sure how this became such a ludicrously expensive procedure compared to estimates online. Does anybody have experience with this sort of price gouging before? I’ve already called the hospital and they insist that the cost of the procedure is $2000, and then there were additional costs for “processing fees” due to my insurance. What is going on here?

As someone with a medical licence the thought of losing it over a complaint from doing this scares the shit out of me . Equally , the thought of someone doing these things with relatively little training also scares the shit out of me .

1jw8k5p,TrueOffMyChest,Of course they always choose someone else,"Last year this early 50s man was hired as our department boss. Attractive guy, tall, takes care of himself and uses botox.

But after some incident that he messed up, he tried to use me as a scapegoat and he wrote me up. Since then, I don't see him since he always comes to work on a later shift. 

One of our managers is a 23 year old girl and they seemed close. I thought it was just professional but no.. There was more. Some coworkers knew but since she is a manager, they can date. We had a meeting and they made a pregnancy joke about them around employees even. Today I heard her mentioning him with a pet name.

He started flirting/bantering with me and I honestly thought he was into me. He texted me whenever and wished me happy holidays. He would always give me attention. 

But after some incident that he messed up, he tried to use me as a scapegoat and he wrote me up. Since then, I don't see him since he always comes to work on a later shift. 

One of our managers is a 23 year old girl and they seemed close. I thought it was just professional but no.. There was more. Some coworkers knew but since she is a manager, they can date. We had a meeting and they made a pregnancy joke about them around employees even. Today I heard her mentioning him with a pet name. Disgusting enough and I have been feeling depressed that I again I was not chosen.

1jw85fr,Haircare,"Extreme hair loss and breakage, any recommendations?","Hello!

A couple of months ago I bleached my hair at home which caused my hair to *rip* whenever I applied even the smallest pressure on it. I got botox and olaplex treatment which helped a lot for a while, but even after that when I shover and brush my hair with conditioner I can still feel how some parts of my hair rips.  
  
A week ago I was extremely short on money and it just happend that I ran out of shampoo, and only had one shampoo that I never used because I've read reviews after I bought it and people said sometimes it causes hair loss. I didnt had anything else so I thought ah its probably not a big deal if I will use it for only a couple of times. 

It was a big deal. My poor hair had gone through a lot already and it was probably a last straw. Whenever I brush my fingers through my hair I get a handfull of it, and my scalp itches. Its so sad because this is the first time in about 7 years when I decided to finally start growing my hair out, and now I just cant manage to keep it healthy.

Can someone recommend me some products that could help? With hair loss *and* the fact that it rips. Some shampoo brands and conditioners/masks and all of that. I dont think I could afford another trip to a hair salon any time soon. Thank you in advance",2025-04-10 20:38:05+00:00,1,0

1jw65st,AmIOverreacting,AIO: told my girlfriend I've got a weight management clinic appointment and her reaction was... Something.,"As the title states, I sent my doctor a message and asked to get referred to our weight management clinic. I'm (33F) seeking help from a professional since I had bariatric surgery over a decade ago now and I feel like I need outside assistance with losing the weight I've gained back (I'm almost 200lbs now; pre-op I was closer to 300; 5' 1"" for reference) and get that last bit to come off so I'm at a healthy weight. I also have chronic high blood pressure and other weight related health issues.

I told my girlfriend (40sF) that I made the appointment... Her immediate response? ""I don't want you on any of those drugs,"" in a commanding tone. This appointment is a gift to myself (humorously, the first opening they had is on my birthday), and to my health. It's important to me to get my weight down, and diet and exercise together just aren't doing quite enough, so I sought help.

This is coming from a woman who I have done my damnedest to support who is also so severely overweight that I've asked her REPEATDLY to get checked for obstructive sleep apnea (she snores like a chainsaw) and keeps saying she'll get out and exercise eventually. Context, she's 4' 10"" and weighs more than I do currently. I still find her beautiful, give compliments, and support her however I can with her health and well-being.

I monitor what I eat. I try my best to eat healthily, though I admit I'm not perfect, and I sure as hell get my steps in at my jobs (pizza delivery and pharmacy technician). My legs are getting stronger every day I spend more time on them after I got injured on New Year's and was out of the game for a couple of months. I spend 10 hour shifts at the pharmacy on my feet, and I know my joints do NOT appreciate the mass of weight on them. I'm doing what I can for myself, but I honestly don't know how to feel about the response to the situation.

So, strangers of Reddit, AIO here in feeling kind of hurt and offended?? Like, I'm doing this for my health, ma'am. I'm trying to support you in getting yours fixed up too (she has a host of health issues herself)... But she doesn't seem very committed or interested. So I just support her as best I can in the ways I do.

ETA: I'm going through a clinic that's in my medical system, not a medspa or something where they compound themselves. Seems I may not have been clear there!",2025-04-10 19:15:53+00:00,63,71

That’s what many MedSpas are doing on Instagram without realizing it.

They create great content, post consistently — but still get low visibility.

Why?

Because their hashtags aren’t built to *catch* the right audience.

Instead of random tags, you need a **strategic net** — a full cluster of hashtags that cover:

* Direct treatment terms
* Desired results
* Emotional triggers
* Audience slang
* Local discovery tags

This is how people *find* you — and how Instagram *understands* who to show your content to.

And yes, AI can help you build that net in under 60 seconds — if you know how to prompt it.",2025-04-10 10:25:25+00:00,1,0

I’ve have suffered stiff neck and shoulders since I can remember. 


I’ve tried magnesium, it helps but not as effective as this Botox treatment. 

I knew, it was the reason for I grinded my teeth when sleeping. My dentist suggested massetter-Botox. However, I declined and cause my jaws are not tense. They are tense because of my trapezius, which again made me grind my teeth, give me headache/migraine during  meds-crashing. 

And I also didn’t want my jaw, chin to decrease in size. (Vanity reasons) 

It’s been almost 3 weeks since I got it.

1jvszm1,vaginismus,I don’t know how to reason with my husband,"Hi everyone. I’m after a bit of advice as I have been feeling very down. 
I feel horribly guilty and insecure because of my vaginismus, and to be fair my husband has contributed to that feeling within first year of our marriage as he said a lot of not nice words. He since changed a bit, he doesn’t say hurtful things, but I can still tell that he’s disappointed and doesn’t support much with words or actions. 
I had to have hymenoctomy as my opening was pinhole size which I didn’t know about previously. I also had Botox done earlier this year. I was expecting it would be a magical fix, it was not but I can now insert size 6 intimate rose dilator and a bit of size 7, which I never thought I could do. However when it comes to PIV, it’s just different, only the tip can get in, and I need to be fully turned on which now really I struggle with. I am under extreme pressure to get it fixed asap and it really affects me. I would like to be open with my husband and be able to discuss this with him, what we can improve etc but he just doesn’t want to talk about it or says he didn’t expect s*x to be science, he thought it was going to be easy. It makes me feel so guilty. I suggested therapy for us both, but he says he doesn’t need a therapist. 
He took me to my appointments, he is supportive as in he waits for me to sort this problem, but that resentment, even if untold is really getting to me and I   feel stressed, which makes it then so difficult to get turned on and it hinders the progress. He makes it seem as this issue is more difficult for him than me, even if it takes me to the darkest places as I feel so worthless. I love him more than anything and I would appreciate some perspective how to tackle this, especially from a point of view of a partner of a woman with vaginismus.

Severe TMJ despite flexeril, cause an episode of Bell’s palsy in 2020 and I cracked 3 fillings last year. 

Severe neuropathy to my feet and numbness in the lower legs BIL. R>L
MRI showed multiple lumbar herniations with spinal cord communication. 
Two rounds of epidurals did not have effect.
Weekly pt for over a year. 
Another epidural to the cervical area for another herniation. 
Many rounds of trigger point injections for how tight my back muscles are. 
Pt said it’s likely compensatory r/t the instability of my spine 
Nerve conduction study concluded peripheral nerves intact but limited communication with the lumbar region

Upper back issues I learned have to do with how I sleep. I am a side sleeper and when I do my shoulder mildly dislocated and I’m sleeping on my scapula and collar bone. 

I also had an episode of intersection syndrome and in the sheath tendinitis of my non dominant arm. 

Frequent and deep colored bruising. Labs have been inconsistent with normal h/h and one with high rbc/iron levels 

Diagnosed with pcos, labs are borderline but to tip towards the dx but the ultrasound was normal.
Place on the pill to manage symptoms. 
(Skin changes, painful cystic acne I have never experienced despite derm regimen, hair thinning)
I cannot remember the last time I ACTUALLY had my period. I sometimes will get the symptoms (cramps and such) but no blood. Over a year at least


I have become bloated and gained weight but not like I typically would. It’s a low belly and jiggly thighs I usually just get it in my face or belly. But I literally cant eat a meal without getting bloated. Like so bloated that I could throw up, and have. I was tested for celiacs. 

Most recently I got a medial branch block which has helped I can at least turn my head with more range now and Botox for my jaw. I don’t know if the Botox is helping yet but I feel like all these docs are just gonna break up with me soon and I need answers.

1jvsm1a,snarkingwithremi,"Remi, simply another Los Angeles PLASTIC influencer queen.","Focus on her eyebrows throughout the video clip… her eyebrows barely move in 2025, compared to the movement she had in 2023. Her eyebrows in 2025 seem much more raised and appear to have less movement. 

She (and her unwavering fans will say “REMI IS FREE TO DO WHATEVER SHE WANTS WITH HER BODY”) which is a half truth… 

She is an influencer BECAUSE she CHOSE to be an influencer as a career. She should have looked up the definition of “influencer” before she made it a career. 
INFLUENCER: a person or thing that influences another. 

She’s able to have a beautiful home, buy whatever she wants, work from home, go on week long vacations. Bring her family on vacation! Which is honestly so awesome and a dream come true! She puts in the work, she deserves to enjoy the fruits of her hard work.
Where I don’t agree is where she comes in her podcast to talk about her journey with body 
and eating disorders. She talks about how much her relationship with food has improved but it’s obvious her Body dysmorphia (which is a disease that overlaps both with body and eating disorders. 

I have a cousin who loved Remi and looked up to her bc my cousin also went through some eating disorders and body dysmorphia. She connected with Remi  bc she felt like she finally found a girl with a body type like their own, finally saw a face that resembled their own… it’s disappointing to find that your idol has been getting Botox for her jaw, and other parts of her face. It’s hard to hear that the person you connected to, will get on ozempic, a drug you can’t afford. So now you’re hating your body even more bc you can’t change it the way your idol could. My young cousin said she doesn’t mind Remi getting on ozempic, but she did feel disappointed to know that Remi gets Botox and other cosmetically things done bc it spreads the message that we need to inject things to our face and body to feel young and beautiful. 
Remi has influenced my young cousin to feel this way about herself.

1jvp5uy,TwoBestFriendsPlay,Assassin's Creed 2 and using older media in place of newer,"Basically I'm just ruminating on the idea of the irony of looking to the past to fill the void that the present and future is granting us. When Assassin's Creed Shadows came out, my hyperfixation started coming back, and instead of spending $70 on a game I know ain't gonna be truely finished for a decent while, I instead loaded up Playstation+ and got the Ezio collection.

It was an extremely enjoyable experience and I can see how Ubi was able it iterate on this framework and how that framework kind of evolved to it's own detriments.

I also started to recognize Ubi's own pattern for this plot now. A thematically linked trilogy with a sole Present Protagonist. Then that protagonist dies somewhat anticlimactically in the 3rd entry. Then we get a series of disconnected games that may or may not have connections to the present plot, then we start again. Cynical & cyclical. We're bound to get a couple more ""disconnected"" games in the future before they figure out how to make something with thematic resonance again.

Unless everything falls apart, of course, but eh.

But in this time of shit getting so god damn expensive, you are still able to find fulfilling experiences in the past in stuff you've never played or in the shadows (the indie scene). May we all survive these coming years with our places in the world intact.

~~God maybe I'm playing these games at a bad time in present history... might not be good for my mental state. /s~~

Anyways.

AC2: Great time, nice variety of cities and locales. Rough around the edges since they're still finding their footing it feels.

Brotherhood: God DAMN that jump up in graphical fidelity is impressive! They hit the exact sweet spot of everything being properly animated compared to modern games while not being ugly to look at like AC1 & 2. Footing has been found! Summoning fellow Assassins makes you feel like a walking death field and that is just supremely enjoyable to me. Best of the trio.

Revelations: Feels *weirdly* rushed. Ezio looks like he's gotten a bit of bad botox in his old age. Still a great time and that level >!with unlimited assassin summons was a highlight.!< They also started including a lot of ""woahments"" as woolie put it, AKA the Uncharted style setpieces which were impressive and memorable. Still a great time despite a couple rough edges here and there. Really made you feel for Altaïr despite having no ability to play Assassin's Creed 1 (which I'm betting Ubi has a FF7 Remake style ""break in case of emergency button"" for that).

The Short Films: Honestly pretty alright. Not sure what else to say about them other than ""they exist.""",2025-04-10 04:06:00+00:00,10,16

I live in the OKC area and have cervical spine issues, especially in the upper region. I see an upper cervical chiropractor which has helped over the years but my eyes never got back to normal. 

I’ve been getting treated for daily migraines by a neurologist, who did an MRI of my brain. The meds don’t really help. I’m down to Botox as last resort which I’m hesitant of. 

My eyes ache all the time, and the first thing I noticed when I got sick was a change in my vision. I was bedridden, feeling like the room was moving. My bed felt like a raft on the ocean even when I was still. My legs were vibrating, my vision was struggling to track motion, watching tv made me nauseated, driving made me nauseated/sick, and I had sinus congestion and head pressure. Nobody knows what it was—I tested negative for COVID.  A rheumatologist said it sounded “viral”. 

The neurologist sent me to a regular eye doctor, who found nothing wrong. My regular eye doctor prescribed new lenses, but they never helped with the lightheadedness, dizziness, or the feeling of being zoomed in/lacking depth perception. I can see okay most days, but on others, my vision is blurry. My blood pressure and blood sugar are fine. Seems like regular eye docs are a waste of time.  ",2025-04-10 02:19:46+00:00,1,4

1jvmvjr,TMJ,Just realised how bad my tmjd really is. Would braces help?,"It just shocked me. I've been doing 3 rounds of botox over a year. Just had my 4th one yesterday. Last round was last sept. So it's been working for 6 months. Which is a long time. But oral surgeon injects quite a lot of botox (which changes the look of my face) but it works. 

As soon as it wears off I realise again how bad my tmjd really is. It hits me again like there is no tomorrow. Mostly with insane headaches, neck and jaw tensions. Tmjd started after root canal treatments gone wrong and a pulled upper molar. 

He only injects the masseters as he doesn't have experience with the temporalis. I'm being referred to a neurologist who will do temporalis as well. 

I'm one of the lucky few in my country (In Europe currently) that has botox covered fully. Which I'm pleased about. Took me 2 years to get it covered though. And to find a surgeon who is willing to help. I've seen tons of surgeons who sent me to orofacial PT and it didn't help. 

Bittersweet feeling.. Should I be grateful that botox is taking the edges off of my headaches or be worried how the hell I'm going to ever lead a normal life again? I can't do botox for life! 

I've tried everything. So botox has been my last resort. No one ever talked about surgery or braces. But I'm considering braces. Idk what's happened but somehow my teeth shifted over the years. Don't know if dental treatments have done this or the tmj splint I wear at night.. But I've had braces as a teen with an overbite and this overbite is returning and there's gaps in between my teeth. Also my lower jaw is sitting way more backwards than years ago. I have no idea why. 

I've had xrays and cbct scan and nothing was ever mentioned about my jaw joint. But I'm starting to worry that there's something wrong with the joint itself instead of muscular tmjd. I've seen tons of specialsts. You name it, I've seem them.

Reading contradicting stories about braces helping. 

What are you're experiences? Should I see an orthodontist to at least ask for his opinion? My jaw is misaligned, so are my teeth. My lovely bite is changing. I have very narrow face and a very small jaw. Feel as if jaw is getting more narrow. ",2025-04-10 01:59:22+00:00,1,0

Plus some skin treatments like rejuran, skin botox and nasolabial fold fillers.

My recovery has been totally horrendous, the first night I got to my accommodation I vomitted the entire night. Then the past 2 days my swelling is incredibly bad. My whole head is blown up into a balloon and feels a bit hard. I'm on Day 3 today, and swelling seems to just be worse. No sign of improvement. 

I visited the clinic everyday, and they dont seem to be worried, or I feel like they're just trying not to make me panic. As from my research, this kind of swelling usually happen more from more intense surgeries like bone shaving or a facelift? 

I'm so worried :(  Has anyone else have this experience during recovery before? I'm really losing my mind about it and thinking what have I done..

1jvld34,TMJ,Nearly a year in,"Ever since last may I’ve been struggling with face pain that has evolved into so much more. Just this past week I finally went on a trip and did something outside of work or staying at home and I had to cut the vacation in half. I have a persistent pain and pressure that can be anywhere in my front top teeth or immense around my nose or just simply on my jaw and TMJ. This usually leads into a serious tension headache every day as well. Ive had loud tinnitus for a bit longer and I now recently am having terrible pain in my butt (my body clenching? Not sure). My ears pop often when I open my mouth or chew, I also hear a pop or click presumably on my Tmj, more so on one side. I try my best to manage day to day but it’s quite debilitating and just three days into this trip it got to another peak and really set off a near anxiety/panic attack due to pain and discomfort especially being halfway across the country.

I need recommendations for great doctors/specialists or practices around the U.S. if any of you have been to some. I don’t think I can try counting on local practices anymore and I’m really over being handed a medication and told to check in two months later. I live in the NE. 

I’ve been wearing a custom fit night guard for 9 months, had my wisdoms out, chiropractor, two gps, board certified TMJ specialist multiple visits, neurologist, Botox on two different occasions, had ct scan of sinus and head and mris of head and cervical which showed nothing of interest, ENT, acupuncture and electro acupuncture, several rounds of meds like antibiotics, anti depressants, nasal spray, magnesium, cbd, exercises, cervical pillow, maybe more it’s been a lot.

I have had almost exactly zero percent relief from any of those things. I know I grind my teeth and my septum is deviated by 2-3 nm. I’m 25 I’m healthy otherwise and I am active. I work but am limited with my pain and discomfort. I’m really at my wits end mentally and physically and I’m really about to start having trouble with being able to pay for things, It’s already been so much and I have to pay for my MRI monthly lol. Physical therapy is my next plan but I need quite literally anything to help me get through this. I wouldn’t wish any of this on anyone.

1jvk43y,NoStupidQuestions,"Got a job that requires a degree / license and I don’t have either, how do I not feel stupid?","
Hey everyone, I’m 22F. I applied for a front desk job back in March. The role didn’t require a degree, just a few years of experience, which I had. First, I did a phone interview that went well, then a Zoom interview that went amazing. After that, I went in for an in-person interview and I loved the place. It’s a small private OBGYN practice. The manager was super sweet and the rest of the management team is Gen Z. The midwives were also great.

At the end of my tour, I got called back to the manager’s office, and instead of offering me the front desk role, they offered me the Lab Technician/ MA position. It involves drawing blood, giving vaccines, and other medical assistant duties. I told them the closest experience I had was counting needles and Botox bottles for inventory at my last job. They said they’d train me, and the pay was way higher, great benefits, school grant programs that I’ve already applied too, and is located in the wealthy part of my city, so I said yes. I mean, who wouldn’t?

Today was my first day, and all the girls I work with either have nursing degrees or are certified medical assistants. I legit have nothing 😓. I’ve never touched a needle in my life. The head lab tech said she’ll teach me how to draw blood using her own arm. I’m totally down to learn, I pick things up fast, but I can’t help feeling like a dumb bitch. A few of the girls seem confused that I didn’t go to school for this role, and one of them even gave me a look after I faced the needle  upside down 🙃, I now know the correct way. And honestly, I get it. I don’t know how I got this job, I didn’t even apply for it.

This isn’t the first time this has happened to me. I guess I just have a good vibe and make strong first impressions?, if I was offered an astronaut role, I would literally take rn,  as long as I’m getting paid. I’m gonna do the job.. 

So if you’ve been thru this how did you manage? Cuz I’m planning on binge watching YouTube and playing it cool. 


Edit: Just to clarify, I never lied about my education. I told them straight up that I have zero experience but I’m eager to learn. Honestly, I don’t think management cares if I have a license or degree, but technically, the state requires a license at the very least. Oh well, I’m not too concerned about it.

Edit: I’m in school rn for dental hygiene. ",2025-04-09 23:36:19+00:00,2,12

My question is, is this experience normal? I understand the 10 unit minimum as everyone in my city does that, but a 10 unit min every single time - even follow ups? And how many times is normal to go back and get Botox added before it finally works? Is this an injector issue or is this how it usually goes?

## Understanding Laser Hair Removal: What You Need to⁢ Know

Before diving into our top clinic recommendations, let's ⁣cover the basics⁢ of laser hair ⁣removal. The process utilizes ⁣focused light beams to target ⁣the‍ pigment (melanin) in hair follicles. This heat damages the follicle, inhibiting future hair growth. Several factors influence the effectiveness of laser hair removal:

*   **Skin Tone ⁣and Hair Color:** Laser hair removal is most effective on individuals with‍ dark ​hair and light skin. though, advancements⁤ in⁣ technology, such as Nd:YAG lasers, have⁤ made it a viable option for those with darker skin⁤ tones. ‍Finding⁢ a clinic⁣ that specializes in laser hair removal dark skin atlanta is crucial.
*   **Laser Type:** Different lasers are better suited ‍for ​different skin tones and hair⁤ types. Common types include Alexandrite (ideal for light to medium skin tones), Diode (versatile for various skin types), and Nd:YAG (best for darker skin tones).
*   **treatment Area:** Laser hair removal can be performed on virtually any area⁤ of the body,including laser hair removal ⁤brazilian atlanta,laser hair removal legs ‌atlanta,laser hair ⁤removal underarms atlanta,and laser hair removal face atlanta. Full body laser‌ hair removal atlanta is also a popular option.
* ⁢  **Number of Sessions:** Multiple sessions ‌are necessary to achieve ⁣optimal⁤ results. Hair grows in cycles, and​ laser‍ hair removal ⁤is onyl effective on hair follicles in the active growth phase.Typically, ​6-8 sessions spaced ⁣several weeks apart are recommended.
*   **Pain Levels:** While not entirely painless, laser hair removal ⁤is often described as feeling like a rubber band snapping against the ⁤skin. Many clinics⁢ offer numbing creams ⁤to ​minimize⁢ discomfort.‍ If you're concerned about laser hair removal pain, discuss ‍pain ⁣management⁢ options with your chosen ​clinic.
*   **Potential Side Effects:** Side effects‌ are generally mild and temporary, including redness, swelling, and mild ​discomfort. More serious side⁤ effects are rare but ​can include blistering, ⁢scarring, or changes in skin pigmentation. Choosing a reputable⁢ clinic with experienced professionals minimizes the‌ risk of side effects.If you have concerns about ⁢laser hair removal side effects, ‌ask the clinic about their safety⁢ protocols and experience.

## Achieving the Best Results: Pre- and⁣ Post-Treatment Care

To maximize the effectiveness of your laser ‌hair‍ removal treatments ‍and minimize the risk ⁢of side‌ effects,follow these pre- and post-treatment guidelines:

**Pre-treatment:**

*  ‌ **Shave ⁣the Treatment Area:** Shave the area to be treated 24-48 hours⁢ before your appointment.⁣ This allows‍ the laser to target the hair follicle without burning the surface hair.
*   **Avoid Waxing, Plucking, or Electrolysis:** These methods remove the ⁤hair follicle,⁢ making​ laser ​hair removal ineffective.
* ⁣  **Avoid Sun Exposure:** Sun ‍exposure can increase the risk of skin damage during‍ laser⁤ hair‌ removal. Avoid tanning beds and excessive sun exposure for several weeks before⁢ your treatment.
* ⁤  **Discontinue Certain Medications:** Some medications, such as ⁣Accutane, can increase skin​ sensitivity. Discuss your medications with your​ doctor and the laser technician before your treatment.
*  ⁤ **Clean Skin:** Avoid applying lotions, creams, makeup, or deodorant to the treatment area on the day of your appointment.

**Post-Treatment:**

*  ‍ **Apply ⁤Cool Compress:** ⁢Apply a cool compress to the treated area to reduce redness and swelling.
* ‍  **Avoid Sun Exposure:** Protect the⁤ treated area from sun exposure by wearing sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher.
*   **Avoid Hot showers and Saunas:** Hot water can​ irritate the treated ​skin.
*   **Moisturize Regularly:** Keep the treated area moisturized to prevent ‍dryness​ and irritation.
*   **Avoid Scratching or Picking:** Avoid scratching or picking at the ​treated area, as this can⁣ increase the risk of infection or scarring.
*‌  ‍ **Follow ⁤Your Technician's Instructions:** Your laser technician will provide you with specific‌ post-treatment instructions. Follow these instructions carefully to ensure optimal results.

1jvja7g,Concussion,Anyone try botox with post concussion syndrome?,"Debating whether i should try or not. Not great with needles, let alone them being on my neck/head. I also have issues with having a lot of symptoms triggered after people touching/manipulating my head, such as getting a haircut etc.

The doctor today pressed really hard on a few points around the front/back/sides of my head and it was definitely painful so he said botox might help? I feel like of anyone pressed their fingers that hard on their head itwould hurt but what do i know..

My fear is just having 30 needles stuck in my head with someone who is not particularly gentle then having a lot of my symptoms retriggered.

 I already basically told him i would maybe just try it once but now im having second thoughts after having some symptoms triggered today after he was touching my head during assessment",2025-04-09 22:56:13+00:00,1,3

1jviczi,work,"Got a job that requires a degree / license and I don’t have either, how do I not feel stupid?","
Hey everyone, I’m 22F. I applied for a front desk job back in March. The role didn’t require a degree, just a few years of experience, which I had. First, I did a phone interview that went well, then a Zoom interview that went amazing. After that, I went in for an in-person interview and I loved the place. It’s a small private OBGYN practice. The manager was super sweet and the rest of the management team is Gen Z. The midwives were also great.

At the end of my tour, I got called back to the manager’s office, and instead of offering me the front desk role, they offered me the Lab Technician/ MA position. It involves drawing blood, giving vaccines, and other medical assistant duties. I told them the closest experience I had was counting needles and Botox bottles for inventory at my last job. They said they’d train me, and the pay was way higher, so I said yes. I mean, who wouldn’t?

Today was my first day, and all the girls I work with either have nursing degrees or are certified medical assistants. I legit have nothing 😓. I’ve never touched a needle in my life. The head lab tech said she’ll teach me how to draw blood using her own arm. I’m totally down to learn, I pick things up fast, but I can’t help feeling like a dumb bitch. A few of the girls seem confused that I didn’t go to school for this role, and one of them even gave me a look after I faced the needle  upside down 🙃, I now know the correct way. And honestly, I get it. I don’t know how I got this job, I didn’t even apply for it.

This isn’t the first time this has happened to me. I guess I just have a good vibe and make strong first impressions?, if I was offered an astronaut role, I would literally take rn,  as long as I’m getting paid. I’m gonna do the job.. 

So if you’ve been thru this how did you manage? 


EDIT: I nvr lied about my education status, I legit told them I have 0 experience but I’m down to learn 😅",2025-04-09 22:14:04+00:00,20,54

I was so excited at how smooth my entire lower face looked. The next morning I woke up and  that frozen feeling was gone and I have regained movement and smooth and bright look was gone.  I know it takes  Botox  10-14 days to kick in, I’m just curious if it’s normal for the effectiveness to come and go until then? Currently on day 7 and my resting face looks the same as it did before treatment. I’m ready to be patient but I feel like I’ve been teased with a smooth bright face and afraid it won’t come back!

Has anyone experienced this?

1jvfynq,Supernote,Magnetic pens 'research',"Hello everyone! I'm in the process of making a magnetic insert for the manta but have come across a slight problem: Not all magnetic pens re created equal. 

I know the Amazon scribe pro uses 2 magnets in opposing directions, the remarkable also uses 2 magnets in opposing direction however they are opposite to the scribe pro. It seems the botox uses unidirectional magnets. 

Can anyone else tell me what pen they use and how the magnets are oriented? (Uni vs bi directional?) North v south isn't super important but if you confirm how they match or mismatch with a scribe pro or remarkable pen it'd be helpful but again not necessary.

1jvfs2a,CabelosDoBrasil,Considerando progressiva," Oii, bom dia/tarde/noite!!
De início, me perdoem por qualquer erro, é meu primeiro post.

 Vamos lá. Meu cabelo é oque chamo de ""indeciso"": liso na raiz até a orelha, ondulado e ameaça formar cachinhos nas pontas.
 Com muito, muito volume.
Essa é a parte que me afeta. Acho cabelos volumosos lindos, e admiro a dedicação das pessoas para mante-los.
 Mas já estou cansada.
Faz muito tempo que considero o alisamento, entretanto, sempre que eu parecia decidida, alguém me fazia voltar.
  Sempre os comentários ""seu cabelo é lindo"", ""você precisa finalizar"" e tals.
OK, eu CONCORDO. Acho meu cabelo lindo, mas o volume não abaixa.
 Testei desde cremes leves aos mais pesados, várias técnicas, no início ele finaliza bonitinho. Mas é só secar e ele desfaz sozinho :(.
  É como se alisasse sozinho, e não importa oque eu faça, ele faz isso. Aí fica aquele aspecto de não finalizado.

  Minha ""guerra"" com esse cabelo é de tempos. Quando nasci, eu tinha muito cabelo, e duas mechas brancas na frente que sumiram :(.
 Até os 8 anos, sofria demais. Ele fazia nós, eu não deixava minha mãe pentear e já viu né. Teve nós que tivemos que cortar.
 A única coisa que fiz nele foi uma descoloração de duas mechas, apenas, em dez. 2022.
  Hoje em dia tenho 16 anos, e acordo todo dia super cedo para ir ao colégio.
Não tenho tempo de ficar finalizando, faço oque posso, e ele repete o mesmo processo: finaliza, alisa, desmancha.
 Confesso que afeta minha autoestima, que se dá muito pelo meu cabelo. Fora a sensação de tempo perdido.

 Voltei a considerar seriamente a progressiva. Não por beleza, mas sim pela certa praticidade.
 Porém, tenho algumas medos/dúvidas:
1. Medo de detonar meu cabelo todinho.
2. Medo de não combinar com meu rosto (minha colega fez há uns 2 anos, e foi triste. Parece que ela perdeu o charme, a harmonia). Para isso estou considerando fazer um botox pra ver como fica antes de decidir.
3. Se eu fizer, e em algum momento quiser voltar ao natural, a transição será tão evidente?Pergunto porque meu cabelo tem a raiz lisa, então não sei como ficaria em caso de transição.
4. Após transição volta ao natural?

Obs: transição me assombra um pouco.

 Estou realmente em dúvida. Meu cabelo é longo, então pela teimosia e volume, costumo usar muito em coques ou tranças, AMO solto, mas não posso usar pq é tanto cabelo que minha orelha não segura, aí não enxergo oque faço. Fora o calor no verão.
 Só pra ter uma ideia, minha melhor amiga tem o cabelo todo cacheadinho, super lindo, o cabelo inteiro dela não dá um lado do meu 🤡.
 Sim, eu CUIDO MUITO dele. Cronograma, bons produtos, hidratação, óleos e etc.
 Há aquele discurso também de ""tudo que é natural é mais bonito"", foi isso que me fez desistir quando considerei progressiva antes. Porém conheci pessoas este ano que alisar só realçou a beleza, enquanto outras, apagou. Quero me permitir descobrir oque melhor fica em mim, só estou insegura quanto a isso que descrevi aqui.

Obs: me perdoem a falta de fotos, tá difícil aqui com relação a câmeras.
 Desde já, obrigado pelas respostas :)

1jvflrt,rachelbrathensnark,"Recap Episode 5 ""I despise this kind of weakness""","Recap Klaveret podcast Episode 5 ""I despise this kind of weakness"" 

It's a pretty long recap but I wanted to catch all of their stupidity. 🤣 It was quite a lot of it this time. 

------
They are so boringggg. 

I wanted to stop listening after 2 minutes even if I just had it in the background

Olivia didn't like to see the low ratings on Spotify (good job everyone) 

They're talking about what people think about the podcast. People seem to have said that they're vulnerable and genuine.  (🙄🙄). 

Mikaela says she hopes people sit with their friends and have an after-talk after the episodes. Or go to a dinner and mentions something they said and create a discussion. 

Mikaela wants men to listen to their podcast too. She gets activated when they say only women listen to it. 

(I zoned out, they are talking about nothing and giggling and mumbling) 

Mikaela is saying she wants to meet someone but it's pretty much impossible to find a man in her age, as they only want to date younger women. She sounds so bitter. She says all men want young and good looking women. 

Olivia says she doesn't think of her wrinkles and is surprised other people sees her wrinkles and talks about it. Rachel asks who? (Reddit maybe? Hello Olivia 👋) She never answers because they change subject every 10 seconds. 

Rakel says botox freezes up the face and you loose the essence. They sound as if they think they are so much more deeper, smarter and mature than everyone else. 

Rachel talks about Olivias' natural beauty and how she looked better without make up on that cover picture. 

Mikaela despises the weakness of people wanting botox etc. She says we should respect whatever life gives you. She doesn't respect people who can't accept reality of life or and lack values. We need to respect the higher purpose. 

( her voice is so judgemental and holier than thou). 

Mikaela says she looks like a brat with make up (girl, you joke that men are more capable than women,  says other influencer podcasts are so fucking bad, only listens to men's podcast.. And is bitter as fuck about men dating younger women..you have a problem). 

BRachel talks about how women carry so much wisdom and primordial strength. (no Rachel nobody sees you as a wise ancestral old woman with your wrinkles.)

What is the solution to this problem? Mikaela says conversations like this is the solution. Maybe people should get together and decide let's not do botox for a few months.. Then she realises how judgemental she sounds and says everyone are allowed to do whatever they want. Mikaela sounds like their podcast will save the world. 

Blablabla they talk in platitudes. 

I'm glad it's only 10 minutes left now. 

They start saying that they are old in comparison to the younger generations. I think they absolutely hate to feel old. 

Mikaela says people hide their botox from her, and they think she can't see it. She says she does see it and laughs like an old school teacher. She says they're scared of her judgment. She admits she does judge them. She thinks people should talk to her about it anyway (wow who would have thought that the consequence of being judgemental, is that other people don't dare to open up for you?) 

Friends are scared to invite Rachel into these kind of conversations.. because they think she's judgemental too? She feels left out and isolated from the conversations. (🤦). 

Rachel says we don't sit in a circle around a fire anymore and have deep conversations, and share our sorrows. We no longer live in a village as back in the days. 

Rachel says she'd only do botox for other women, so that women don't judge her. She wouldn't do it for men. (we already know you don't care about what Dennis thinks about you lol). 

They sound like they're trying to reach some deep insights but it's thee braincells trying their best.. And it's not reaching a very high level 🤣 Mikaela seems to think she deep, but she sounds like 15 year old. 

They hope this podcast can make people talk about natural beauty more. They sound as if they'll save the world. It also sounds as if they really want people to change, as they don't want to be the only ones without botox. They are so anxious and self obsessed. 

The end. 

Another brain rot of a podcast.

1jvdj54,Esthetics,Is Nursing school the only way?,"Hey guys, 

I am an esthetician with a laser certification - I am having trouble finding a job in a medspa. I'll admit, I need to tweak my resume up a bit and haven't been applying as actively as I probably should - I am in college right now (I use financial aid for paying off personal expenses and plan on getting a bachelor's degree as a fall back plan)  but I am wondering if I should go to nursing school to be more qualified in a med spa. 

I am wondering if my lack of medical background has anything to do with me not landing a job - I heard spas like to hire someone who's an RN as opposed to a person who just went to beauty school and a laser institute because the RN can perform ""cross procedures"" (they can provide someone with botox AND lasers as opposed to a laser tech *only* being qualified enough to perform a laser treatment). The problem is, I'm getting my associate's next month (yay) which means I only have 2 years left to complete my bachelor's in any study I choose.

 If I  try to go for a BSN I'll have to ""start over"" on my schooling because I've only covered a handful of the prerequisites required  for the BSN (same applies for an associate's of science in nursing) - whereas other health majors I have more of a chance of completing in 2 years. I'm a new single mom, and I'm fortunate enough to have my step mom watching my baby boy while I focus on finishing up my degree, but I can't stand school right now - I have so many financial burdens that need to be taken care of and my son will be living with his step granny until he's 5. I just want to get financially stable as soon as possible (don't we all) but, without the stress of school involved. The faster I get school out the way and find a job, the faster I can pay off my debt and focus on creating stability for me and my son. I am passionate about the health and wellness industry - which is why I got into esthetics, and find myself looking towards a health degree now (probably just not nursing - because the schooling would take too long now) 

  
TLDR; I am burnt out from college, but I don't think I could land a job at a medspa without any medical background first. If I go to nursing school - I'll have to ""start over"" on my degree plan. Is completing nursing school and becoming an RN the only way a medspa will hire me?",2025-04-09 18:50:03+00:00,1,11

1jvd7gu,migraine,Antiviral (valacyclovir) hugely reduced my migraines,"I’m not a doctor, but I read about herpesviruses living in the trigeminal nerve being a potential cause of migraines and wondered, after many failed migraine treatments, if that could be what was happening for me. I have always gotten bad cold sores and my doctor ran a blood test that showed that I had mono previously (which is caused by another herpesvirus)—based on this, she prescribed me daily valacyclovir. It has made the most dramatic difference in my migraines of everything I’ve tried. I went from daily, incapacitating migraines to now having just a mild headache every few days. My life is completely different than it used to be. I can’t believe the answer all along was a simple, minimal-side-effect antiviral instead of all these injections and new expensive drugs (which I know can be great for some people of course, but they didn’t work for me). 

I can’t say if valacyclovir will work for other people but I just wanted to share my experience because I was trying all the classic new and old preventative treatments (Botox, Emgality, Ajovy, Topamax [that went very, very badly], Vyepti, Nurtec, gabapentin, amitriptyline) and to be honest none of them really worked in a significant way. Botox even made things worse for me (injection site aggravation and cold-like symptoms that would last at least a week after the injections and worsened my migraines). 

I really wonder if more people out there are in the same situation I seem to have been in: migraines caused by latent HSV-1 or Epstein Barr virus. There’s not a ton of research in this realm (maybe because no one will make a big profit off of people taking valacyclovir…), but I can say from personal experience it’s been life changing.

I use gua sha sometimes on my jawline, would that be a problem after getting filler? Can I still do it or would it cause the filler to move?

Do you have to avoid touching the area completely? And do you have to sleep on your back after?

I’ve never had Botox or anything done before, so I’m just really cautious. I’m nervous about looking overfilled or getting pillow face or the filler migrating.

Any advice or experience would really help, thank you!",2025-04-09 18:24:06+00:00,1,5
1jvcq4o,TMJ,Fatique from Day Splint,"So my dentist has been treating me for TMD. It's unbearable; after a course of naproxen and diazapam she won't give me anymore medicine. I was given a thick guard to wear at night, which has improved the pain to some extent.

However, I went for help from my GP and they have my TMD issues down as 'migraines'. They won't help me beyond migraine treatment (sumatriptan) and the codeine I have is because I'm diagnosed with fibromyalgia/ME.

I won't go into the nightmare of trying to get help but my dentist, a TMJ specialist who has hEDS (as I do) offered me botox. After I read the the horror stories, I opted for the second offer; a day time splint. The day time splint stops me clenching/grinding my teeth, which is great, but wearing it triggers my fatigue severely.

When I have the day splint in, I've become prone to symptoms that look like narcolepsy. There's times I feel the sleep 'wave' coming and I have five minutes to find somewhere to be comfortable (or uncomfortable if I'm unlucky) and then I'm out for hours.

Does anybody else get fatigue with day splints? I'm seeing my dentist tomorrow so I'll ask her, but I'm not sure I trust what she pushes at me. ",2025-04-09 18:17:07+00:00,2,1

1jvbqo8,BFS,"My 2 year health journey - Twitching, Near-Fainting, Visual Disturbances","I’ve been meaning to write this for a while. I’ve read so many stories on here that felt similar to mine, and I guess I’m finally at the point where I just need to vent, share my experience, and hopefully hear from others who’ve been in similar shoes.

My health issues started in early 2023, around February. It started off pretty vague: brain fog, fatigue, and just feeling off. I didn’t have energy, I couldn’t think clearly, and something deep down felt wrong. Then the headaches began deep, aching pain right at the base of my skull where the neck meets the head. I had my first brain MRI in April 2023. It came back normal.

Symptoms kept progressing. I saw my first neurologist, a headache specialist, in July. She thought I was having migraines and wanted to try Botox injections. I planned to start that in September, but around that time, everything changed.

In late summer into fall of 2023, I started experiencing: • Muscle twitching all over my body  
• Visual floaters  
• Muscle jerks  
• Near-fainting episodes with tunnel vision, going pale, and almost passing out

These started in October and have continued ever since.

I was referred to a neuromuscular specialist. They did a full-body EMG and noted fasciculations but no other abnormalities. They suggested muscle relaxers and anxiety meds. I tried to convince myself it was all in my head and pushed through the next few months.

But by January 2024, things became overwhelming. The near-fainting episodes increased. I was exhausted constantly. I lost 30 pounds and looked like skin and bones. I had persistent muscle pain, weakness, and just felt awful all the time. My PCP ordered another EMG and a muscle biopsy. The EMG was normal again, but the biopsy showed slight denervation atrophy in my right quad. I was told it was probably just a pinched nerve.

Since then, I’ve had: • 4 EMG studies  
• 2 brain MRIs  
• 1 full spine MRI  
• A muscle biopsy  
• More bloodwork than I can count

I’ve seen: • 2 primary care doctors  
• 3 neurologists  
• An endocrinologist  
• A rheumatologist  
• A naturopath

All of my blood work has been mostly normal. Nothing has ever come back way out of range. Every doctor either brushes me off or just says “nothing to worry about” and moves on.

I’m now in 2025 and still dealing with all of this daily: • Headaches at the base of my skull  
• Brain fog and memory problems  
• Fatigue and malaise  
• Muscle soreness and stiffness  
• Twitching all over—now constant in my right foot arch and left shoulder/arm  
• Tremors and shakiness  
• Numbness and tingling in random areas  
• Joint pain  
• Buzzing or internal vibration sensations  
• Visual disturbances like floaters, flashes, snow, and orbs  
• Feeling overly nervous and spastic  
• Cold sensations down arms or legs  
• Metallic taste during near-fainting episodes  
• Occasional shocks from the base of my neck downward  
• Purple stretchmark-like lines around my groin

The visual floaters and near-fainting spells are what keep me from being able to enjoy life like I did before 2023. They’ve made it hard to feel normal or safe doing everyday things.

I also have this strange issue with my right foot. It feels weak even though I don’t have clinical weakness. It’s like I have to consciously think about lifting it when I walk. I noticed a dent in my right shin where it feels off, and they ordered another EMG of that leg. That EMG showed radiculopathy in three muscle groups, but once again, they said it’s not indicative of MND.

I’ve never had any major health issues until all of this started in 2023. The last two years have been miserable and have seriously impacted my life",2025-04-09 17:38:05+00:00,3,3

My first trimester this pregnancy, I only had 1 or 2 migraines. I am 15 weeks now and the last couple of weeks I have been getting them daily. They start out as nausea and then shooting pain in either of my temples. Ice, heat, magnesium, Tylenol, excedrine
, caffeine.. they all might help for a little while but eventually I have to end up taking a sumatriptan.

1jv8p6u,DIYCosmeticProcedures,TOX not working. Help?,"Three weeks ago I tried Innotox for the first time and didn’t feel much for results (I went light and used mostly two units everywhere except for 3-4 units in DAO and glabella, 1 unit for lip flip spots). I waited the two weeks and did a “touch up” of an additional two units everywhere. I’m about five days out from the touch up and the only spot I’m really feeling anything is the lip flip. I feel like the innotox isn’t working for me. I ordered Nabota, would it be safe to give this a try in a few weeks, or should I wait the 2-3 months just to decrease risk of developing a resistance to tox? 
Possibly relevant background info: I used to get Botox from an injector with a really heavy hand( I went every 4ish months for a year and a half, but she would regularly use over 100 units on my face which I think was overkill at the time), but I haven’t had anything for over a year. Could the amount of toxin I was exposed to previously have already caused some resistance? Does Innotox just not work well for me? ",2025-04-09 15:33:52+00:00,2,4

Is there anything stronger than gabapentin?

Will Botox help?

1jv6q56,ChronicPain,An actual solution for jaw clenching?,"I’ve had chronic pain on one side of my face for years now, made worse by having had BPPV (vertigo) several times over the last year. It stems from my shoulder into my neck, behind and in front of my ear, my orbital socket, and my jaw. 

I’ve been to PT, TMJ PT, had dry needling, trigger point injections, massage, Advil, muscle relaxers, a TMJ bite guard, orthodontist (she told me to sort out my neck first). Most of my work with my current PT is aimed at strengthening my posture and rotator cuff, but a huge part of my problem is clenching my teeth at night. 

I wake up with an almost gristly feeling like my muscles on that side of my face are crispy and dry and rubbing over each other. I’m in so much pain and cry myself to sleep many a night from the pain I’m in. 

Does anyone have any solutions that really work? I’d be willing to give a different night guard a try; my only concern is that it will help my teeth but not the actual clenching since I’ll still be able to clench. I know the most likely answer is Botox in my jaw but I really don’t want Botox. I used to get it in my forehead for aesthetics but each time I’d have terrible flu like symptoms and I’m super paranoid about iatrogenic botulism and just generally don’t like the way it makes me feel.

1jv6e76,letsbehonestpodcast,Kristin’s break down of “why she looks so good” on the latest pod ep,"Short answer: girl is rolling in $. 

Of everything she listed there’s some one time expenses would be the air filters & water filter : 7k

Ongoing expenses (monthly and weekly) for all organic farmers market food, aesthetic treatments (not counting how much she spends on products) and a trainer 4-5 a week: 105,400.00

So the answer to why she looks this good is because she’s rich in time AND money. She can spend more than the average persons  yearly salary on cosmetic treatments and groceries and working out. Has the time to go workout, someone probably does her shopping for her..Like cool that’s she transparent about what she actually does to her face and to keep her body looking good but this isn’t helpful to the average person 🙄 

she demonizes getting botox but like a botox treatment average is 500 dollars and needs to be done like 3 times a year… so yeah if I wanted a treatment I’m choosing one that’s  1,500 per year instead of 25k. I usually don’t do this much of a deep dive but Just thought this was interesting so needed to calculate the averages when I heard her listing everything. ",2025-04-09 13:56:11+00:00,12,3

1jv60a7,BipolarReddit,Does anyone else experience pain in their dreams? I have been experiencing nightmares twice a night every night for weeks now.,"In my dreams are feeling more and more real.

I have trouble waking up from dreams.

I guess I am lucid dreaming.

I often scream.

I also experience pain in my dream which I heard is very rare.

At first my dreams were trauma related (family, religion), but now they are more about me being afraid of dying or getting killed. (dreams stop being about my personal life basically so maybe my nightmare med is working?)

Scary stuff.

I started taking Prazosin two weeks but my nightmares haven't helped. I even had a really bad intense nightmare today. I woke up feeling tired afterwards. I was half asleep and hallucinated.

I should mention I'm also schizoaffective.

I also have mild sleep apnea and insomnia.

When I think about it, my nightmares started when my unresolved chronic tension headaches got worse. They were happening every day, nonstop, 24/7.

I was so depressed!

I hate pain so much.

It disrupted my life. I had to miss class for 3 weeks. I did no homework during that.

It was hard.

I was depressed before and I always have symptoms of mixed episodes too. (that's another story)

My headaches seems to be due to treatment-resistant TMJ.

I did a botox procedure and I'm doing better now compared to last month but it won't break. I still have constant pain. (pain going across my forehead, the middle basically, classic tension headache symptoms?)

My neurolgoist is trying to see if I can do an Avoyy injection next. 

I wish I knew why I have so many sleep issues and what to do about it.

My sleep apnea symptoms started in 2021 but my insomnia and other sleep issues started in 2020 when I was actually diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

One of my symptoms is me going to bed early (afternoon) and getting up like at 2 am. Every single day!

I can't believe this has been going on almost five years now.

Being up in the morning is super depressing.

Plus my psychiatrist says it's bad that I'm not asleep between the hours of 2 am and 5 am because your body is supposed to release hormones important mood and mental health during that time.

Maybe that's why my depression is treatment-resistant. Why I always have symptoms of mixed episodes everyday.

I plan to talk to my psychiatrist about increasing my dose. I heard some people take 12 mg of Prazosin. 

Was I just suffering for no reason because my dosage is low? ",2025-04-09 13:38:44+00:00,1,0

In this clip, a woman explains how we've been groomed since we were little girls that we have to look good and present ourselves. It got me to thinking..

Not only do I agree but this is exactly what makes dating harder for women! (as the clip is titled) The things we have to do is an endless list. We are expected to learn how to do our make-up

Hair

Lashes

Eyebrows 

nails did 

Skin care regimen

Toes did

Spanx & heels

Botox

Fillers

Fashion 

Lipo

Designer handbags 

Breast augmentation 

Jewelry 

BBLs

etc

We have been groomed to believe that we need to do all of that for ourselves. Meanwhile men weren't groomed to put in anywhere near the same effort.

Therefore, I believe women have it harder.

Is there a surgery for vaginismus? Other than rounds of Botox? (I’ve already tried one round, it helped me get to dilator size 3). I’ve also already completed physical therapy and I’m in talk therapy. 

I’m a cisgender woman (not that that matters, just adding it because of anatomy reasons for surgery options). ",2025-04-09 01:01:17+00:00,3,5

1jutgbi,migraine,Getting off nortriptyline advice & other med thots,"Hello!! This migraine subreddit has been such a solid boon! My gawd, thank you! 

Have been reading how getting off nortriptyline is painful/ bad withdrawal. Would love any advice on any titrating down success stories, suggestions for how long you titrated down etc. I’m only taking 20mg in the evening. Am having lots of break through migraines and the side effects are already trash, so moving to another med. likely Nurtec and maybe Quilpta too. 

Would also love to hear any success stories in getting insurance to cover Botox!? Was initially wanting to shift to Nurtec + Botox. 

Side curiosity: Anyone have body inflammation go up on nortriptyline? 

My history & other meds I tried: 
I went from only having auras since my teens, to using sumatriptan when the headaches started coming in my later 20’s, to moving to a prophylactic in my thirties when they were getting to be throughout every week. I started on Topamax, which was great but when I had to up the dose, all the cognitive fun/ memory fog started. My doc switched me to nortriptyline, the switch was painless but these side effects are horrible. 

Also considering trying Topamax again at the lower dose when I wasn’t experiencing cognitive fuckery.

1juseo1,LaserHairRemoval,Milan vs. Medspa?,I've been doing research and really want to do laser hair removal. I don't have many options in my area but I've called two med spas and they have said that their price (1700-2000) for a package of 6-8 sessions would need to be paid up front. Is this normal to do? I am so worried about paying so much up front and not seeing results or not having a good experience. It's alot of money and I just don't want to regret it later. I do have an appointment with a medspa this weekend (like the only place I found that had weekend hours and is 45 min away) and I also have an appointment with Milan Laser. I know Milan is going to be much more expensive but they are closer to me and I like that they offer lifetime services. Would you do a medspa or a company like Milan?,2025-04-09 00:00:00+00:00,1,2

1jurr3i,vaccinelonghauler,Movement disorder and stiffness in left side of body,"I dont feel like writing too much. I spend night and day thinking about why things are like this. 

I've slowly had symptoms of muscle tightness and neck and body twitching increase gradually since I got the two part moderna mRna vaccines back in Spring of 2021. I was male 23.5 at the time. Within the past two years it's been harder to ignore or brush off so I've seen multiple movement disorder specialists. 

The most annoying symptom is having half my head feel tight with is pulling in my head, jaw, and neck and it continues further below. 

At the time I thought it was Dyskinesia symptoms when it occured to me later on that it could have been the vaccine. The best the movement specialists have come up to treat it are injections of botox every three months and I've been on 40mg of Ingrezza about to go to 80mg. I figure if some benefit occurs this would point to a transmitter issue, but now I'm doubting that's the case.

I'm trying to understand the spike protein theories going around. Doesn't the body lower and filter the amount of spike protein naturally over time? Having been almost four years since vaccination, what spike protein is left to be detoxed? Also, are there any theories as to why my symptoms would have increased over time rather than peaking initially?

I'm planning on committing to Dr. McCullough's Ultimate Spike Detox for a few months if it makes sense to do it. I've done a water fast for a full week over a year ago just to try things. I only broke it one time having a coffee that week. Idk it that ruined the whole fast though. ",2025-04-08 23:27:55+00:00,5,1

I was firstly planning to get the masseter  botox done to help relieve all the painful symptoms i have been getting, however i’ve just been told that it’s a temporary solution to a bigger problem. So when i went in for my consultation my dentist told me i need the following;

1) full jaw examination 
2) discuss options eg lower splint
3) long term apply orthadontics
4) adjust the bite to remove bad contacts

I have been quoted £2700 for this and i am unsure if i should go through with it. He said its a hard splint 3 month therapy. An acrylic splint fits usually over the lower teeth and is worn 24 hrs a day except when cleaning it and eating. Bare in mind that my dentist also mentioned that i may still need aligners or braces after this, which are even more pricey.

1juql0m,multiplesystematrophy,Any success with Interstim Implant?,"Hello! Husband just diagnosed with MSA following a Syn One test, with several years of symptoms including REM sleep disorder, tremors, hunched forward and tilted walking, falls, ED and frequent and urgent urination. Two previous neurologists misdiagnosed. Huge ramp up of urinary symptoms occurred before Christmas. Testing at Mayo clinic showed open bladder neck and kidney and bladder stones. Subsequent visit to neurologist resulted in the Syn One test and MSA diagnosis. Mayo urologist says husband can't have planned ablation surgery due to neurogenic bladder, but suggested the Interstim implant would be good for him, better than botox which must be repeated under anesthesia so often, that the anesthesia would wear him down. Looks like there is a new generation of the implant that is good for 15 years, if the trial period warrants implanting it, and just requires charging once a month for a half hour. This latest generation can also go through an MRI without problem. No incontinence yet, but so many trips to the bathroom constantly, even with Mirabegron (myrbetriq). He hesitates to go anywhere now because he is afraid of having a urine accident, even though he is wearing the Depends when out and about. And, those nights are exhausting. Nobody has recommended catheter yet, as he is apparently somewhat early in the disease and does not want one. Any links are also appreciated.

1juq376,EDAnonymous,"Life long struggles, just need to vent","I have been a binge and restrict eater most of my life, long before I even knew what an ED was. I remember being in elementary school, like 6th grade making myself puke up my breakfast everyday, so much so that the teachers would get sent in to ask what was wrong with me. 

My parents of course, never thought anything of it. They’ve always been overweight people. I know they probably heard me puke when I was younger, I did it all the time. As I got older, that progressed into ditching the puking, (couldn’t do it anymore, throat felt burnt 24/7 and I was starving) 

So I started to avoid eating on certain days. Like I would have eat normal one day, and then the next I wouldn’t eat at all. I don’t mean like I would eat fruits or eat low cal, I mean I wouldn’t eat. Period. I would do that 2/3 days a week. Done that for a year or two. I was very skinny. When I look back this was when I was the happiest with my body. It’s what I wish I looked like now (yes I know this is unhealthy)at the time though, I literally thought I was the ugliest fattest girl to ever exist. 

Into my adult years, I now bounce back and forth between eating normal, binging, or restricting. Last year was hard for me. I went through a period of not eating. I lost a lot of weight quickly. I’m talking 40+ pounds. People commented on how much better I looked. How skinny I was! I was even asked if I used the O medicine (which of course my ED brain took that as a compliment, fucked up I know) 

I visited a med spa for laser treatments occasionally, all the women there were absolutely gorgeous. They were all skinny, blonde, they had work done (I mean they sold Botox) but they looked very naturally pretty. They normally barely spoke to me and acted as if I was an inconvenience when I would come in. But after I lost all that weight quickly they all started being super friendly to me, asking how I did it and telling me I looked amazing. They even offered me free treatments at one point (something I don’t think they would have done when I was bigger) 

Now a year has passed, I’m eating normally. I’ve kept most of the weight off but I’ve gained a few pounds back. I have trouble because since I haven’t lost anymore, no one comments on how I look. There was people that acted concerned about me when I was going through it last year, but they have stopped asking if I’m okay or if I’m eating. 

And now that makes me think I’m my head, ok well I must look really fat now because no one comments on my weight anymore. I struggle with the difference in treatment when I’ve weighed more vs when I’ve lost weight. I swear people treat me completely differently. It’s jarring. 

Maybe I sound crazy for wanting that? I don’t know. Ive never really been complimented much in my life. I’m not conventionally attractive. I’ve never really opened up to anyone about my issues with food before. I got offended last year when my partner commented on my weight loss and accused me of starving myself, I lied and told him that I had been putting in a lot of work being healthy (not proud of that) 

I tried to tell my mom about some of it, particularly the binge eating and she just laughed and will make remarks about me always being a fatty or always loving to eat, and that’s not a disorder. Still to this day she makes negative comments about me eating (like I said despite her being fat) and when I’ve called her out on it she will just say oh you know I’m joking. And if I push and say it’s hurtful she gets angry and flips it on me telling me I’m always so offended by everything. But she’s done this my whole life.

1juplq1,HairRemove,Is Paying Upfront for Laser Hair Removal Normal and Which Option is Better: Medspa or Milan Laser?,"  
Many individuals considering laser hair removal often find themselves asking whether it is common practice to pay for treatment upfront. After all, this is a significant investment, and with several medspas offering packages with prices ranging from $1700 to $2000 for a series of 6-8 sessions, it's understandable that a potential client might feel a bit uneasy. They wonder if it's normal to be asked for full payment in advance, and whether this approach might leave them feeling vulnerable if the results aren't as expected.

When you are new to a treatment like laser hair removal, questions like these are completely natural. You want to ensure you're making a sound financial decision while also investing in something that will deliver lasting results. The upfront payment structure is indeed quite common in many medspas, and there are a few reasons why this is the case. For one, laser hair removal is often sold in packages, since multiple sessions are required to achieve optimal results. This method allows clinics to secure the commitment of clients and helps streamline their booking process. Additionally, laser treatment is a professional service that requires a good deal of expertise and expensive equipment, so a deposit or full upfront payment can provide financial assurance for the business.

However, it's perfectly reasonable to feel concerned about committing a large sum of money before even knowing whether you'll be satisfied with the results. If you're not sure, it may be worth looking for providers that offer more flexible payment plans or even pay-per-session options. Some clinics offer a money-back guarantee or touch-up sessions if you’re not satisfied with the outcome, so make sure you ask about those possibilities.

Now, regarding your options between a medspa and a chain like Milan Laser: this is also a common dilemma. The appeal of Milan Laser lies in its higher cost but the promise of lifetime services, which may alleviate some of your concerns about ongoing treatments. If you anticipate needing follow-up treatments down the road or if you simply value having a long-term commitment to the results, Milan could be a good fit despite the higher price. Medspas, on the other hand, may offer a more budget-friendly option, but it’s crucial to ensure they are reputable and have a strong track record in delivering safe, effective treatments.

Ultimately, it boils down to your personal priorities—whether that’s proximity, cost, or long-term benefits. It's essential to weigh the value of each provider based on factors like convenience, trust in the service, and customer feedback. Don’t hesitate to ask for a consultation and gather as much information as possible before committing to a provider.",2025-04-08 21:49:33+00:00,2,1
1jupkjk,noburp,Here's how I kinda fixed it when botox failed,"I was having this issue since ever but currently I'm way releifed.

I used to stick my finger in my throat to force a burp.
Then I discovered that it's actually an issue and that i'm not the only one who has it.

I tried botox injection twice externaly with no anesthesia. 
Two weeks of hard swolowing food and micro burps were not enough to provide a permenant fix and results faded very shortly.

One day i had a huge burp built up but couldn't release it and i had enough with the finger sticking thing since i was sitting with friends smoking.

One huge hit led to aggressive coughing and guess what.. The burp came out.

I spent months after that replacing finger stucking with forcing my self to cough and recently I noticed a huge diffrence. Burps now come out naturally, not loud and strong as you would expect but enough to not feel bloated.

Now the forced cough I only do it once a week or so, which is something I can live with just like  there are peoole who sometimes need a soda to burp.

Anyways.. I suggest you give it a try 🙏 ",2025-04-08 21:48:09+00:00,6,1

1juonbd,PlasticSurgery,Early 30s marionette lines help,"Hi there, I’m 33 and starting to see my face slowly droop/gain heaviness in the lower half. 

Mostly noticed it this year in some photos and lighting I hadn’t before. I recently went to a jfahsion even and to my disappointment the camera had caught my least favorite feature about myself, these dang lines that have become apparent this year. 

I can’t tell if the lower half heaviness is from gaining weight (15lbs since 2022) or natural aging. It’s not hugely noticeable, but does make me self conscious seeing myself have lines from the corner of my mouth to my chin, and less likely to want to be photographed. 

I’ve never had injectables or work done, but I think it’s about time as I get more into my 30s. I’ve included my face from other angles as well to kind of give a 360. As you can see they aren’t there all the time or in all lighting. 

I was already thinking to treat myself to some Botox for my crows feet, and potentially some radiesse in my chin area/cheeks to help with the shadows. Overall a little facial balancing. 

Do you think that would be an appropriate treatment for this issue? I can’t afford any facial lift or surgical procedure at the moment, but am planning to save for when I’m hitting my 40s. 

I’ve had a consult before for injectables and the injector also suggested masseter Botox, along with Botox, some chin filler and cheek filler. Does this treatment seem appropriate for this concern? 

I personally just wanted to hear other’s opinions and if anyone else had this problem corrected with a similar face shape.

I've noticed the Ajovy reduces the severity, and has reduced the frequency by half. Unfortunately, I'm still having at least 15 migraine days per month, sometimes more; they're also getting harder to break with rescue meds or they break and come right back the next day. Due to some rather embarrassing and unpleasant symptoms, I'm scrambling to get things better managed. I was hoping we could add Botox as part of a more layered treatment approach.
For those of you who are doing or have tried Botox, did it work for you? Was it a stand alone treatment or used in conjunction with other treatments? Was it quickly approved by insurance? Were there any side effects or interactions? Does it hurt? Did you notice a difference immediately or did it take more than one session to see results?

1jumddm,Dystonia,People with CD -- does your back ever hurt more than your neck?,"Got diagnosed with CD in early 2022 after a major flare-up where my neck was fully locked in a twisted position. I was 32 at the time and had had upper back pain for years, but never neck spasms like that. It took a year and a half but we eventually got the neck spasms under control with Botox and neurorehabilitation, so I have full control of my neck now but still have tightness no matter how much I stretch.

I'm a day away from my shots tomorrow, and what's crazy is that I still have control of my neck, but my back hurts SO BAD. It's mostly behind and between both scapula -- the upper middle back. I find myself using a foam roller or lacrosse balls every hour or two, which is the only thing that (temporarily) relieves the pain and makes me feel somewhat loose. Every time I use it, there are crackles and pops (sometimes it's just the fascia, sometimes it's the actual joints popping, often times it's both). The pain flares up most when I'm sitting down (even with good posture).

I'm wondering if the dystonia might be creeping down into my back muscles. Or I guess it could just be certain muscles getting more use as my shots wear off.

Todavía tengo familia allá, y me encanta verlos cuando voy, pero también me gustaría empezar a ser un poco más independiente en mis visitas. No quiero que piensen que los estoy utilizando o que tengo que verlos cada vez que voy — a veces solo quiero ir a pasar unos días tranquilos o de vacaciones.

¿Qué me recomiendan?

Idealmente, me gustaría encontrar algunos lugares de confianza en Guatemala, como:

~ Un lugar para tratamientos faciales (botox, rellenos, faciales, etc.)
~ Lugares donde pueda hacer voluntariado( en Antigua) pero no quiero esos lugares donde solo van extranjeros y les hacen pagar. Me gustaría formar una relación real con una organización y poder aportar de manera genuina.
~ Lugares donde pueda mandar a hacer ropa si lo necesito.
~ Pintores locales que sean profesionales y confiables 

Cualquier consejo o recomendación es bienvenido.",2025-04-08 18:26:43+00:00,5,5
1jukpq0,chinlipo,Botox injection for muscle tightness,"Has anyone done Botox injections into the platysma to relax the muscle? 

I got chin lipo 8 weeks ago and during my 6 week check up was told my muscles are still very swollen and tight and that I can either get Botox injections to help ease the muscle tightness or I can continue with my massages and hope that it helps with it in the long run 

I’m starting to be hyper aware of how tight these muscles are and am highly considering getting the Botox injections 

Has anyone done this before? 
Did you find any relief? Did your results improve from it? Did you continue your massages after the injection? Do you have to go back and do more injections or is it a one and done situation? 

Thank you in advance ",2025-04-08 18:25:28+00:00,4,9
1juknm2,legal,Can I sue? Chiropractor visit resulted in Vertebral Artery Dissection Location: South Carolina,"I was diagnosed with head and neck cancer in 2019, specifically, Oropharyngeal cancer in my tonsils and throat. I underwent chemotherapy and radiation which eliminated the cancer. As a result of radiation treatment to my neck I suffer with radiation induced fibrosis all throughout my neck area. My neck is always stiff and in some sort of pain, often causing spasms. I've tried many things for relief including Botox injections. 

After dealing for so long with pain, against my wife's advice, I  went to a local chiropractor in my community. He conducted diagnostic X-Rays, took my medical history; which included the history about my throat cancer and treatment; and proceeded to layout a plan to help relieve my neck pain and also correct what he identified as an issue with the alignment of my neck and spine. The plan was for deep tissue massages for 15 minutes followed by an adjustment of my neck. I visited him about 4-5 times. On my last visit he attempted to adjust my neck twice and was unable to retrieve a ""pop"" of the neck area to signify an adjustment. The next morning I woke up with a migraine and extremely bad vertigo and nausea.  

I work with patients who have had traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord injuries, and strokes. I'm a program coordinator for a non-profit who assists them in finding resources. 

Because of my exposure to these populations; I worried the worst may come true to me - I thought I may be at risk of having a stroke due to my symptoms. I went to the ER and expressed my concern. I received a CT scan and MRI which revealed I had a Vertebral Artery Dissection. 

  
""A [vertebral artery dissection](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1RXQR_enUS1036US1037&cs=1&sca_esv=fb769e0fcd5d8652&q=vertebral+artery+dissection&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj5o96uhMmMAxWURDABHUbVGM4QxccNegQIAhAB&mstk=AUtExfAwroniCtjAd6SiU36OQfGNfqbMv8k80zhWvjLvZTf1wRSaAjWTWF0ilW3mQMi0XeNPvqRPrwhL6y0uuMaOQ2lLW8QYatBDH3e2ICSgQGZchk82uvZlVsQEeUYPaz1TaTWFGz59UtnprpM6QjxEe1cp7NziTSDVE-2L6ieiq_8mlU0&csui=3) is a type of injury where **a tear occurs in the inner lining of the vertebral artery**, a blood vessel in the neck that supplies blood to the brain, potentially leading to blood clots and stroke""

I was advised to no longer attend the chiropractor, prescribed aspirin to prevent blood clotting (lifelong now) and told not to lift any weights or do any exercising for 6 months to allow it to heal. 

  
Everyone I have shared my story with has asked me if I was going to sue the chiropractor. 

  
I haven't spoken to an attorney but I wanted to get some input to see if this is worth pursuing. 

  
All of my medical bills have been covered as I am a disabled veteran. However, I have had some life difficulties as a result of this injury which include gaining weight, my thyroid is now not operating the same and I am on medical for hypothyroidism, depression, all of the things that come with something you'd expect like this. 

  
Any input about this potential case would be valuable for me. Thank you for taking the time to read.

1jujqng,HealthInsurance,Claim denied & Mayo won’t change their coding,"Hello! I have had impossible to treat migraines for the last 3 years. Most of that time being all day every day. I live in MN so I decided to get a second opinion at Mayo. The neurologist I saw recommended an occipital nerve block and ultrasound of my carotids as my MRI/MRA was only done of my head. I proceeded to get both done—finding out later that they were incorrectly coded  & insurance views them as medically unnecessary. Mayo will no change their codes so I am in the process of filing a dispute with insurance. It also is complicated because Mayo is not required to provide estimates & I had already obtained prior authorization to be seen there so I thought I was good. Any suggestions on ways I can prove my point? At that point I had failed almost every class of meds for migraines, had Botox for two diagnoses, & had all other possible testing done. My aunt also has fibromuscular dysplasia. My dad has young onset Alzheimer’s & chronic migraines as well. 

Edit: typo & I should probably explain a little more & say I shouldn’t have wrote they were incorrectly coded—instead I should have said they were coded in a way that insurance denied coverage. The part that I am having the most difficult time understand is the ordering provider was different than the provider performing the procedures. I can add my EOB—I’m just new-ish to posting so it may take me a second to figure out haha 

Edit: looks like the EOB for the ultrasound is a $500 fee for no prior authorization so I can understand that one. My insurance liaison in charge of my case stated that Mayo refused to drop the fee (which I can understand). I guess I learned my lesson there. The EOB for the procedure states that insurance doesn’t cover procedures that are under study &/or accepted my the medical community. I also learned a lesson there as I had no clue about any of this and should have known more prior to going in. My desperation definitely clouded my judgement there. I’m just curious if I should even attempt to dispute this all or if that’s a waste of time and I should just pay the bill? 

Edit: gah—“not accepted by the medical community.” ",2025-04-08 17:47:10+00:00,0,12
1jujdht,noburp,"Will the burps come naturally after the Botox wears off, or do I have to do something?","First Botox: 100 units. Did not work at all, no burps. 

Second Botox: 120 units. Life changing for ~4-5 months, lots of burps. 

The Botox is long gone now, and my symptoms are back the last 6 months. I am now wondering, should I have done something to learn how to burp? I always thought burps came naturally, so I didn’t think much of it while the Botox did the job. 

I am going in for a third (and final) Botox injection. Should I do something this time? I actually have no idea how to actively burp, but should I?

1juhzrb,AITAH,AITAH for calling out how my partner talked about women aging?,"We finished white lotus. I (35f) and partner (35m) were chatting, and he said that Laurie looked “beaten up” and that Parker Posie “let herself go” and that it’s sooo important to take care of yourself. He’s made these comments before, and his tone just irked me. I don’t like hearing women talked about that way, when it’s not even true!
Secondly, he sparked some fear in me. What if he starts talking to me like that when I’m 56?! Will he dump me if at 44 I look 44? It caused a cold chill.
Well, it turns out, I didn’t have to wait til 44. I told him “hey I don’t like the way you’re talking about them, they don’t look bad” or something along those lines. 
He literally says” you just feel called out because you’ve let yourself go. You relate to those women”.
For once, my big reactive mouth was speechless . I’m 35, 5’8”, 138 pounds. I have a chronic injury, and am going to PT from another injury, but I can’t do much exercise and it kills me mentally. I love fashion, but we work from home so usually my hair is wavy, no makeup, glasses, casual clothes. Still, when we go out, I still think I look good! I have lost the sparkle in my eyes, my face is a little meh (despite the Botox I get in my forehead) and my hair is think and fragile all from stress. He’s constantly picking on me, constantly fighting and yelling and causing drama. I def have aged the last 5 years with him, from the depression and stress.
Anyway, I tried to talk to him last night, as he literally ignored me the whole next day. I said I was genuinely confused why HE was mad at ME?!!! He immediately flew into a rage and said “we’ve talked about this before. I want a partner who tries, who wants to be better. You’re just comfortable.” He baldly lied and said he didn’t say I “let myself go” when he did, clear as day. It got awful, and I think I need to leave.
Am I the AH here? For stating I felt uncomfortable when he made disgusting remarks about women, and then for feeling sad the next day? ",2025-04-08 16:36:26+00:00,1,17

1juhlen,MassageTherapists,Advice for pricing at new location,"Hello! Posting looking for advice for my boyfriend, he's been an LMT for awhile now but not on reddit much.

He was working at a Hand & Stone (chain spa), and was the most requested therapist there for about 5 years before moving into a location that he shared with a classmate. Since moving he's been doing pretty well for himself at his office and doing mobile visits through Soothe. He specialized in deep tissue at H&S, but now tends to do a mix of deep tissue and swedish and has been doing good like that for about 3 yrs. His normal pricing is 135/hr in the northeast San Antonio area in TX.

The office he was sharing with his classmate was cheap at 600/mo, but while he had his room looking fairly plush and nice, there was much to be desired in the building. He was constantly having to sweep up dead bugs in his office. There was no waiting area so clients would have to wait in the car if he had back-to-back so he could reset the room. The outside while not ghetto, was definitely older looking (paint peeling, poorly tended landscape, etc). The bathrooms especially were pretty bad, the lights would flicker,  the plastic/vinyl countertop was stained and had rings, the cleaning supplies were out in the open,  the paper towels would just sit on the counter and get wet, the faucets were coated in lime deposits, there were always spiders in the corners of the stalls, I had ants crawl in a line past my feet once, the doors to the stalls would stick to the point of having to yank or shove, and some of the toilet paper holders were broken. 

He had clients tell him they loved his work, but would not refer him to their friends or family due to the location. 

Recently, he went and took a week long in person certification course in manual lymph drainage,  and then a weekend in person course on post op lymphatic. He plans on getting certified for edema drainage as well, and maybe gua sha. He picked up a course on Brazilian wood body contouring too.

Also recently he found an office to rent at a medspa in shavano park, a nicer area of town with a more bougie clientele. The medspa has a large posh looking lobby, a receptionist to greet the clients, coffee/tea/water/wine for the clients, and the whole space is very clean, well designed/decorated, well lit, has multiple awards scattered around, and a social media manager that he can work with. The bathrooms are also very nice, with fancy soaps and a selfie mirror. There is also a before&after room with a posture grid he can use. The space is a bit smaller but looks absolutely amazing compared to his old one, @1000/mo. He will not be sharing with his classmate as she will have to stop soon for personal reasons.

Because he's not familiar with the area, it's such a big upgrade to the environment, and there aren't many that do lymph drain in town, he's a little unsure of what to price himself at. Other services at the medspa include a $200 facial, fillers for $800, cryotherapy (which will be reffering for lymph drainage) anywhere from $3-8k, and specialty fillers for like $3.2k. There is also a tennis club across the street, a diabetes clinic, and a cosmetic surgical consultant in the same small section of buildings. 

Any suggestions/ideas on pricing? The few prices we have found on lymph drainage around here seem like mostly from chains, at like 130-150/hr. He was hoping to bump it up a bit from that based on the other services in his location, and from the higher end market of the area. He has about 10 yrs experience now and even his instructors for the lymph classes would complement his flow and pressure variation, having him help some of the other students.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, I didn't see anything in the rules for this sub against posting regarding prices so I hope it's okay, sorry if this was a little long!

PS he was also thinking on doing a 'move in' promo for new clients, and letting some of his regulars/long time clients at the lower rate for a few sessions before bumping the price up for them.",2025-04-08 16:19:51+00:00,4,12

I have had 5 cosmetic procedures in the past 4 of them from Colombia and one botched procedure from Canada.

Hey Reddit!

I wanted to share my experience with the Elite Medical Center in Juffair, Bahrain. This place deserves your attention if you're looking for high-quality cosmetic procedures and dental services.

# Cosmetic Procedures They Offer:

# Botox Treatments

Their Botox services are administered by certified professionals who understand facial anatomy. The results look natural, not frozen, and they take time to discuss your goals before proceeding. The effects typically last 3-4 months, and their pricing is competitive for the region. The medical director, Dr Khaled did help me in the discussion, no regrets at all.

# Fillers

They offer various types of dermal fillers, including hyaluronic acid-based options (like Juvederm and Restylane). The staff is skilled at creating subtle enhancements for lips, cheeks, and addressing deep wrinkles. I appreciated that they didn't push for an overdone look but focused on refreshing my appearance.

# Laser Hair Removal

Their state-of-the-art laser technology works effectively on all skin types. The process was much less painful than I expected, and they have cooling systems that make it comfortable. They offer package deals that make the full treatment course more affordable.

# Dental Services

Beyond cosmetic procedures, their dental department is excellent. They provide:

* Professional teeth whitening
* Veneers and bonding
* Invisalign treatments
* Routine cleanings and check-ups

# Why I Recommend Them:

1. **Clean facilities:** The center is immaculate and uses modern equipment.
2. **Professional staff:** Practitioners are board-certified with international training.
3. **Consultation focus:** They spend time understanding your needs before recommending treatments.
4. **Reasonable pricing:** While not the cheapest option, the quality justifies the cost.
5. **Convenient location:** Easy to find in Juffair with parking available.

# Tips for First-Timers:

* Book a consultation first - it's often free
* Ask to see before/after photos of their work
* Don't rush into multiple procedures at once
* They speak excellent English if language is a concern

Has anyone else tried their services? I'd love to hear about your experiences too!",2025-04-08 06:56:48+00:00,1,0

1ju6m0d,migraine,Feeling so hopeless and defeated at 1:30 AM :(,"What is wrong with my head/brain? 

This is going to get lengthy, apologies for that and thank you so much in advance for those who read and share feelings and input here.

I’ve been in this community for quite some time and I still sit here to complain about the same thing over and over again. Ive been suffering from migraines for what feels like centuries now with no real answers and barely any relief and I just don’t know what to do anymore. They’re getting worse and scarier. 

Scarier because they seem to be left side focused. My temple region, my face, my jaw, my neck, my eye socket. I would say 90% of my migraines always start on the left side. Sometimes they travel to my whole head, most time just consistently there with barely any relief at all. I’ve seen numerous neurologists and have roughly about 5 MRIS in my lifetime (I am a month shy of 33 years old.) They’re always clear. It sounds crazy, but I so desperately wish they would show something besides some stupid nasal bullshit and my neck has some issues too. I tried PT and of course… nothing. 

I’ve tried numerous medications, vitamins, supplements, relaxation techniques to massages all to which help barely half the time and not enough to lean on. The only thing I haven’t tried is the injectables (I’m scared) and Botox (also scared however feel it’s my last resort atp.) The vicious cycle Advil and Tylenol cause is gut wrenching, however sometimes I feel like it’s all I got. 

I’m in SUCH a bad flare the past few months on and off. I’ve done everything I can think of. I thought perhaps it was my teeth, but nothing of course is wrong with my teeth or so they say. I personally feel they got worse after a root canal that is STILL bothering me on the left side so much that I’ve decided to get it ripped out. 

Don’t even get me started on what my menstrual cycle does to my head… SHEER agony. Before and after my period and during ovulation is just… there aren’t even words to describe it. The pain is mind minding. 

I’m starting to suspect I’ve developed temporal arthritis. I have all the symptoms so that is going to be my next endeavor to whoever decides to actually listen bc everyone I’ve seen about my migraines is well, completely inattentive and brushes me right off. 

What else can I do? What else is there left to even try? Where do I turn and how do I finally get an answer to my problems here? I’m so fucking frustrated. I can’t continue to live this way. I don’t understand why this is happening to me. I have other issues like anxiety and depression (shocker), IBS and endometriosis (or so I believe) and the migraines always take front seat. It’s so debilitating. I’m so sick of everyone around me patronizing me. Making me feel like I’m fucking crazy and “HEALTHY” and young. I’m a “hypochondriac” bc I’m constantly hyper fixated on my pain. I can’t do it anymore. I’m so desperate for RELIEF. my heath anxiety is at an all time high. I’m not living, I’m just fucking surviving.

Sorry for the rant, I’m just pissed. ",2025-04-08 05:58:02+00:00,5,3

1ju58zw,TattooRemoval,"Tattoo Regret , My First Laser Removal Experience, + Questions about Hypopigmentation","Hi everyone,

I just wanted to share my story because honestly this subreddit has been so helpful, and I know how isolating tattoo regret can feel — especially when you’re young and navigating impulsive decisions.

I’m a 20 y/o woman and I ended up getting a coverup of a tattoo that honestly… wasn’t even bad at all. I was just being indecisive and impulsive, not thinking things all the way through, and unfortunately trusted the wrong artist. I didn’t expect the coverup to have to be so dark, especially on my chest (yeah, not the smartest placement in hindsight). It just happened during a really spacey time in my life — a mix of stress, impulsiveness, and trying to distract myself, I guess.

I didn’t even finish the coverup because I quickly realized how much ink would be needed to make it “work,” and it just didn’t feel right. Now I’m dealing with this heavy feeling — like I’ve devalued my body in some way. I know that sounds dramatic, especially since I already have a few other tattoos and I’m moderately tatted for my age. But this one just impacted me differently. I wish I had slowed down and really thought it through.

After I let the regret linger, I decided to try laser removal. I had a few consults, including one at Removery (which I approached with a bit of bias thanks to this subreddit, sorry not sorry). There, the technician pressured me into an unlimited sessions package and wanted to treat me on the spot—even though I told her my coverup was still fresh and research recommends waiting at least 8 weeks. During that consult, she also mentioned that Q-switched lasers aren’t safe for someone with my skin type (Fitzpatrick 3–4), which confused me since I later learned that the wavelength is key and that anything with a 1064nm wavelength is best suitable for darker skin tones.

Ultimately, I went with a promising Medspa that uses the Astanza Trinity system with the Duality Q-switched YAG laser at 1064nm. The tech there made me feel comfortable by actually listening and not pushing a hard sell. I had my first session on March 26th—everything seemed okay at first (see photo #2, taken a few days after treatment). Then, on April 2nd, I started noticing lighter spots appearing on part of the tattoo (photo #3). Now, as of April 7th, it almost looks like those spots might be enlarging (photo #4). I’m not sure if I’m overthinking it, but I’m really anxious about the possibility of hypopigmentation.

So, what do you guys think? Does this look like the onset of hypopigmentation? Or is this normal for about 2 weeks of healing from treatment. I can’t tell if I’m psyching myself out or if it’s Hypopigmentation. If it is, what should I do? I’ve done some research, but the information is so sparse and conflicting that it’s only making my anxiety worse. I’ve come across suggestions to try vitamin C or niacinamide, though I’m not sure how effective they would be. I’ve been using a scar gel that contains silicone and applying vitamin E oil, but Im not sure if that’s helpful at all. I know I should keep it out of the sun and apply sunscreen, of course, but I feel hopeless now—like I’ve made an even bigger mistake by deciding to laser this tattoo.

I’m planning to email my technician about my concerns, but I figured I’d ask here too, since I practically live on this subreddit these days. I’ve been reading posts about “white ghosts” of tattoos after laser treatments, and that’s got me super nervous. Please be gentle with your advice—I’m really just looking for some guidance and reassurance from all of you who have experienced similar or just wanted to share anything.

Thanks for reading and for any help you can offer!",2025-04-08 04:29:45+00:00,5,5
1ju4nej,PlasticSurgery,nerve damage and banding after neck lift: my surgeon dismissed my concerns and now its too late to intervene?,"i had a neck lift two years ago. on recommendation from a \[different\] plastic surgeon friend, i went to a very well known facelift practice in california, which i traveled for after doing a couple of consults with him and thinking about it for a few years.

i am female and in my 40s. i paid close to $20k because of the reputation of the doctor and my own fear of having a bad outcome.

all i wanted was a tighter jawline, with a little volume reduction under my chin. i have had a full face and jaw 'softness' that translates as mini-jowls for most of my life even when very lean. 

my surgeon said that the way to get what i wanted was a short scar neck lift. one 1-2"" scar under the chin, and incisions from drains at my earlobes. my neck was smooth and nice, with no obvious banding, and i didnt want my actual neck (ie, below my hyoid bone) to look any different after surgery. my surgeon said that was fine. i trusted him to know what procedure would ultimately achieve the aesthetic i wanted.

the very first night after surgery, i could tell i didnt have the result i was hoping for. i also had more pain than was reasonable along my jaw, and the drain incision points under my earlobe were absolutely lighting up the nerve into my lower face. my doctor told me i was overreacting and that i just had surgery, and (basically) to relax and be patient.

i saw him again for drain removal and raised my concerns, especially about my loss of motor function with my mouth, and jaw and chin sensation issues, but also visual problems: there are now vertical ropes and a 'middle seam' in my neck that didnt exist before. (thats the photo, which is recent. it is worse in motion than when still.)

he said again that i had surgery and needed to be patient while my body healed. he said numbness was normal and i needed to give it 12-18 months.

i checked in with him some weeks later, and we had the same conversation. my mouth was still actively pulling down and drooping hard. it was difficult for me to talk and creepy to look at. i questioned whether everything was too tight. my jawline is slightly uneven and my jowls are perhaps worse (in part because of a reduction he did under the center of my chin). my neck looks like hell, and has aged me \*years\*. i work remotely and i am on calls all day. i see what i look like. its awful for me.

he again said i needed to just be patient.

i waited a year (and change) and went to see my surgeon in person. he dismissed my concerns about the way my neck look, and even said he ""never would have promised my neck wouldnt change."" i was FLOORED.

he insisted that i have a good result and that he is happy with the outcome because in profile view there is a small reduction of fat under my chin. i didnt have a lot to begin with, and that wasnt why i was doing surgery.

i pointed out that my mouth doesnt work the same as before surgery, and that in addition to the numbness around and under my chin, my mouth pulls down, hard, in the corners. it has completely messed with my natural smile and i cant even pull my mouth up all the way anymore. i have had to start getting a large amount of botox into my platysma bands to reduce the pulling just to get it closer to neutral. this is expensive and not a thing i needed before.

he tried to tell me that could not be related to the surgery, because he didnt do anything that would go near those nerves. i am furious.

maybe he didnt ding those nerves with the neck/front work, and perhaps hit them with the drain incisions. i dont know. but i KNOW this started with surgery, i could feel it the first night. and i have done literally nothing else in my life to my face except botox in my forehead. i can still poke the tiny scar lump below my earlobe and feel the nerve shoot all along my jaw.

so, here i am, two years after surgery and six months after my last visit where he offered to fill in these gaps with fat transfer or filler. i absolutely do not want my neck to look like this (or my jowls to be uneven, and exacerbated by this cobra-neck-deformity-thing) but i am deeply hesitant to let this same surgeon do anything to me.

everything i have read suggests that anything we might have done to intervene and help with nerve issues should have been done earlier.

im so, so sad about this.

if anyone has advice, or knows what happened here and whether there is anything to help my motor function or my aesthetic concerns, can you please share?

1ju4e1n,migraine,Migraine Medication Choices,"I have chronic migraines (recently started getting auras). I have seen so many neurologists and tried a bunch of medications and we are getting down to a slim few left. I wondered if anyone could give me their experience with any of the following that my neurologist has recommended. I am meeting with my psychiatrist tomorrow since I know some medications can interact with my current ones for my anxiety/depression. 

To give you an idea of what I’ve tried, here is the list and the results:
1. Atenolol - No response
2. Sumatriptan - Caused hallucinations and since my migraines are almost daily it wasn’t plausible to take daily
3. Relpax - I honestly don’t remember its effect but I know I was taken off of it. 
4. Aimovig - Caused unbearable headache
5. Toradol shot in migraine cocktail - No effect 
6. Nurtec - Allergic Reaction (Itchy, swollen throat)
7. Qulipta - Allergic Reaction (Itchy throat and rash)
8. Propranolol - Reduced frequency (Still on but unable to go past 20mg a day due to it dropping my heart rate and blood pressure too much.) 

The first new medication suggested was one of the Tri-Cyclic Antidepressants (Amitriptyline and Nortriptyline). These are honestly the ones I’m more open to because of my bad experiences with other medications and my allergies to CGRP pills. That way if I have a bad reaction, I’m not stuck with it for however long it takes for shots to get out of my body. BUT, I’m on Lexapro 10mg, Buspar 20mg, and Klonopin .5mg daily so I know combining another medication in this class puts me at risk of QT interval issues and serotonin syndrome. So, thats why I plan to talk to my psychiatrist first. 

The next medication the was suggested was Emgality. Given it’s also a CGRP and I’ve had allergic reactions to the CRGP pills, I feel like a CRGP injection would be such a bad choice. I also had the bad response to Aimovig, so it just seems so scary to me. 

The last one is the one I’ve been trying to avoid for YEARS and that’s Botox injections. I have read horror stories and really worry about getting them. But, if I am not given the clear by the psychiatrist or if those don’t work, it may be my best option. 

That being said, ultimately, I’ll be making these decisions with my doctors over the next week, but I’d love some insight into how these medications do for you. ",2025-04-08 03:39:02+00:00,2,21

Not only does it not appear to have done anything (likely due to my purposeful overworking my lip muscle to metabolize the Botox because the side effects were horrid imo), but my incontinent mouth problems are a deal breaker.  I’m not willing to risk being unable to use my mouth normally again.

1ju3scz,migraine,"Anyone with migraine or facial nerve pain get sharp nasal bridge pain? Triggered by alcohol and cold, relieved by cardio?","I’ve had **daily pain in one specific spot on the bridge of my nose** for over 5 years. It feels sharp during flare-ups, and more pressure-like the rest of the time. MRI and sinus exams are normal. I’ve had sinus surgery, and both ENT and neurology are involved, but there’s still no clear diagnosis. Consistently getting worse with terrible flair up for past 5 days.

What’s strange is the consistency of what makes it better or worse:

# 🔥 What makes it worse:

* **Alcohol (any kind)** – brings on sharp pain almost immediately. Feels like vascular dilation might be aggravating something.
* **Cold air or a cold nose** – being outside in winter or sleeping with the furnace on seems to increase pressure and irritation.
* **Lack of sleep** – pain usually flares the next day.
* **Possibly sleeping on my back** – less consistent, but sometimes seems to increase pressure.

# ❄️ What helps:

* **Cardio exercise at night** – consistently reduces pain, even on bad days. Maybe from vasoconstriction or sympathetic activation?
* **Hot showers** – reliably relieve the pressure and relax the area.
* **Getting more sleep** – reduces overall pain levels.
* **I** I think **Emgality** and **Botox** – provide partial relief, but haven’t resolved it.

I’ve also tried **verapamil**, **nortriptyline**, **Nurtec ODT**, and an **indomethacin trial** (which did nothing, so hemicrania continua seems unlikely).

I’m curious if anyone else with **migraine or nerve-related facial pain** has experienced this — especially the combo of **alcohol and cold being strong triggers**, and **exercise + heat helping**.

**Medications:** Emgality (monthly), Nortriptyline 25mg daily, Verapamil ER 120mg daily, Nurtec 75mg ODT as needed  
**Diagnosis history:** Migraine diagnosis, history of chronic sinus inflammation, sinus surgery \~4 years ago  
**MRI:** Normal  
**ENT exam:** Normal  
**Indomethacin trial:** No effect

For the past 6**+ years**, I’ve had **daily pain localized to one specific spot on the bridge of my nose**. It’s **sharp during flare-ups**, more **pressure-like at baseline**, and **never visibly swollen**. It has continue to get worse and latest flair up is terrible and made me miss work. Its daily and never goes away.

# Symptoms & Patterns:

* Pain is always in the same spot; occasionally radiates toward the tip of my nose (oddly feels better when it does).
* No numbness, tearing, nasal discharge, or neurological symptoms otherwise.
* Not congestion-based, and not linked to seasonal allergies.

# Triggers (worsen pain):

* **Alcohol (any type)** – most consistent and severe trigger
* **Cold air / cold nose** – worsens pain noticeably
* **Lack of sleep** – pain often worse the next day
* **Possibly sleeping on back** – inconsistent

# What helps:

* **Cardio exercise (especially at night)** – consistently reduces symptoms
* **Hot showers**
* **Getting more sleep**
* I think **Emgality** and **Botox** have provided **partial relief**

I'm being followed by neurology and ENT, but so far no clear diagnosis. I'm wondering if this could be due to **nasal nerve entrapment**, **contact point headache**, or a **migraine variant** like midface or sinus-area migraine. I haven’t had a nerve block yet but planning on discussing sphenopalatine ganglion or anterior ethmoid nerve block next.

Has anyone experienced **chronic, focal nasal bridge pain with this specific response pattern** — especially the **alcohol and cold triggers, and exercise relief**?

1ju3jh9,PlasticSurgery,Recessed chin/lip incompetence - how much can be fixed with Botox/filler?,"1-3 = very angles of my mouth when relaxed.
4-5 = what happens after a little while of holding my mouth closed. 
6 = side view relaxed.
7 = side view forced.
8 = forced closed more. 
9 = mouth closed smile
10 = full smile. 

31/F. I have about 6-8 months of invisalign left to move my front teeth back some more, but I don't think that is going to solve everything. I got 5 pokes of Botox in my chin a few months ago so it's worn off about 85% but it does help my chin be a tiny bit less recessed looking. I haven't had fillers or anything else before yet. 

I'm planning on getting that refreshed in a couple weeks and am trying to to figure out if I should get Botox elsewhere to further help my lip placement/smile. I'm also planning to get some chin filler for more balance and some in my nasolabial folds because they're pretty prevalent. 

With my smile, I don't like how asymmetrical it is. The extra crease next to the edge of my smile on the left, and how my upper lip pulls up more on the right. It's hard to tell as much in the photo but it's like I'm smiling on one side of my face and scowling on the other sometimes. 

Any ideas on what else I should maybe ask for? I was thinking maybe a lip flip but I heard they can be annoying. The upper chin Botox already makes it so I can't rub my lips together that well. I also don't really want my lips to be much bigger looking than they naturally are necessarily.

1ju2sv2,nursepractitioner,Is it worth it?,"Hi all, 

I am a FNP working in primary care, family practice for about 2 years now in a private clinic in a HCOL state. Our clinic has 2 physicians and 2 APRNs. I am working 3 days per week, 11 hours per shift, seeing about 20-30 patients per shift. My salary is $125k per year, no bonus/RVU. $2k CME and about 15 days PTO and 3 sick days per year. 

The absolute worst part of my job is the large proportion of patients who are wealthy, entitled, and so quick to whine/complain/write a horrible online review if they don’t have all of their 10 needs/wants addressed within their visit time. I am literally at my wits end with their attitude and snobbish behavior. One example is a patient that was seeing me for her broken arm- I referred to ortho, ordered imaging, refilled 5 chronic meds, increased a BP med, reviewed annual labs, did a full physical, ordered mammo, Dexa, and also at her request ordered a vitamin panel. Spent a considerable amount of time with her on diet education for lowering cholesterol. And the next day guess what? A horrible review saying that I was calling her a fat pig (I was not) and upset I didn’t refer her to dermatology for Botox. To be fair she did say she felt like she was looking older, but we just didn’t have time to dive into aesthetics. I just don’t know if this job is worth it.

1ju2rq0,Perimenopause,How do I know if symptoms are Peri or something else?,"I am only 39 so feels very early but last year I did have several months of very heavy periods which was a bit weird for me and cycles have been getting shorter (24-25 days usually) over last few years but always regular. Until last month I had a 21 day cycle followed by 18 day cycle. Around this same time I had extreme breast tenderness and heaviness and have had many days of extreme exhaustion and getting more migraines than I normally do. Also have had acid reflux which I never had before. But mostly just exhaustion and feeling achy some days and then other days feeling fine. I also happened to get Botox around this same time and starting having those symptoms about a week after injections so I don’t know if it’s from that or the weird cycles/ hormones. 

What were the first signs of peri for others?

It feels early, my mom went through menopause at 50 so I wouldn’t expect things to start early for me but maybe they have. ",2025-04-08 02:11:26+00:00,14,13

Unfortunately, I am seeing it wear off 2 months after, on one side more than on the other.

1ju2dzs,SkincareAddictionLux,Lux dupe?,"A friend who I consider very “lux” in her life and her skincare recently recommended the GoPure brand and the TruSkin brand on Amazon to me for the best skincare around. She even said she dropped La Mer for the go pure moisturizer. I’ve never used La mer, and I think these moisturizers have different purposes - ie La mer is for hydration whereas the Amazon brand has glycolic acid. I was hesitant on these recommendations because it was a random Amazon brand but my friend drops thousands at our medspa monthly so I rolled with it. 


But, that being said - I went on a limb and bought the go pure moisturizer (the blue creamy one) and the neck tightener (purple) and holy moly the change on my face!!! Nothing to comment on for the neck but I don’t have much sag yet at 36. Friend is mid 40s and says she sees a change.


The moisturizer is 4% peptide blend, 4.2% glycolic, 2% niacinamide and has a creamy texture, reminds me of Clinique moisture surge moisturizer, maybe a bit thicker - def a winter moisturizer. Anyone know what (if?) this is a dupe for? I’d pay big money for an even more effective version. ",2025-04-08 01:52:28+00:00,4,11

1ju1f7v,Aging,Are dynamic wrinkles normal for a 28 year old white women?,"I’m 28f white, and have dynamic wrinkles under my eyes ALOT when I smile. And I can’t tell if this is normal anymore or if I’m aging at a faster rate than normal?!?

I don’t have Botox or anything and I have a good skincare routine. I can definitely work on my hydration but I can’t help but feel like I’m aging a lot faster than the people around me?!? I can’t tell if I have a warped sense because of social media, if so many people around me have Botox that I just don’t know what’s normal anymore or what.

But it would help to get some perspective on when it’s normal to see this happening age wise 

Edit: okay so majority of people in the comments asked these questions so let me clarify some thing:
1) I wear sunscreen every day double layer before I leave my house and have been doing this for the better half of a decade now
2) when I say dynamic wrinkles I mean wrinkles that appear under my eyes when I smile they don’t stay there but every time I give even a small smile they wrinkle up bad which makes me insecure to even smile anymore. 
2) I have a strict skincare regime including retinol, hypotonic acid, snail mucin for hydration, multi-peptide, even tone and lift cream, triple moisture repair and SUNSCREEN SUNSCREEN SUNSCREEN. I put spf 50 on and then another layer on with my makeup as I don’t buy any makeup without spf in it. So not using sunscreen isn’t the issue for me peeps
3) I probably could do better with my diet as I do eat healthy but not the healthiest. I will definitely take that into consideration as I move forward.
4) I exercise 5 times a week and wear sunscreen protective clothing from head to toe.

1ju1eos,askdentists,Not eligible for a gingivectomy,"Hello, I have a gummy smile and have been researching options to address it. I learned that a gingivectomy might help, but my dentist said I only have about 1 ml of depth, while the procedure typically requires 2-3 ml. They referred me to a specialist for a consultation, which costs $370 AUD ($222 USD). The specialist will evaluate me for ""crown lengthening and a cosmetic gingival reconfiguring."" I'm wondering if anyone knows the costs associated with these procedures or if there are other options available for treating a gummy smile, as I'm looking to enhance my smile without considering Botox, and I also want my teeth to appear larger.

1ju15t0,migraine,Constant Pain/Pressure Between Eyebrows. Tried everything. Help!,"Hey everyone,

Maybe somebody can help, because everything I have done up to this point hasn't helped. For about 9 months now, I have had constant pain/pressure between/across my eyebrows. Also at times, I will feel a little dizzy and feel like I am losing my balance. I have seen **SIX** different doctors - neurologist, ENT, primary, optometrist, ophthalmologist, and dentist. The only thing I've had done is LASIK in July of 2021, but my ophthalmologist and optometrist both indicated that there are no issues with my eyes at all. I've had bloodwork done, eye dilated, brain mri without contrast, CT of my sinuses, and full dental exam and of course, everything came back perfect with no results at all.

I have been prescribed numerous headache/migraine medications - nortriptyline, topiramax (had a bad reaction to this one so I stopped), and ubrelvy. Right now, I've dropped all my pills and I am trying monthly shots of Emgality to see if that will help. I'm almost done with my first month. Other than that, I've been on almost daily/every-other-day Tylenol and motrin to just have some sort of relief. I've started to take daily magnesium to see if that can offer some relief.

I am just starting to lose some hope here about what I can do next. I try to massage the area to get a little bit of relief, but that's about it. If the Emgality shots don't help, my neurologist said the last resort is botox, which I don't really want to do, but I'll do it just to do the final checkmark.

Anyone else experiencing something similar and have a remedy? I'm just kind of in the slumps at this point and try to stay positive every day, but it's getting rough.",2025-04-08 00:49:27+00:00,1,0
1ju152d,ProstateCancer,Botox to treat Bladder Spasm Pain ?,"My 90 y/o father has advanced prostate cancer. He has had a Foley catheter for 9 months, and after many failed attempts to go without it, he has accepted the fact that he will have the foley for the rest of his life. The main issue is he gets frequent painful bladder spasms, and none of the antispasmodic medications seem to help. The spasms seem to be the worst when passing gas or when he needs to have a bowel movement, and also at the end of the month when it’s time to change the catheter. However even when those 2 things aren’t an issue, he is still having frequent painful spasms.  Since he plans to keep the foley, the doctor is looking into weather Botox might help reduce or eliminate these spasms. Does anyone have any experience with this? Did Botox help? Or does anyone have any other thoughts on what could be causing these spasms and how to reduce them? His cancer is reacting well to treatment, but these spasms are so disruptive to his day, he continues to decline in mobility and quality of life. ",2025-04-08 00:48:23+00:00,2,0

1ju0tql,Veterinary,2022 grad needing advice for next career move,"My start to the vet world has unfortunately been horrendous. Ive had to weather many storms breaking me down and beating me up leading to restarts and do overs. I think Im ready to continue in this profession.

Heres kind of my timeline:

Graduated may 2022. Waited 6 months for an epic african safari trip with my dad as a grad gift. Looked for a job for a couple months, had three offers and accepted one. Started mid november or december of 2022. Severe health crisis in january 2023 and hospitalized for three weeks. In recovery for three months. Told them I could go back to work then severe health crisis end of april 2022 before I was working. In recocery for two and a half months. I decided not to go back to work.

 Coping with mental and physical side effects from new diagnosis and working with therapist and psychiatrist. Then went to work for big corporation november of 2023 and lasted 7 months. This was a horrible position. I got extremely burnt out and I had poor mentorship and support. They let me go because they didnt agree with how I handled a case even though I followed what my mentor told me to do via text??? Yeah make it make sense. I also received a board complaint over that same case not because of the care but because it apparently took too long for the pet to get seen even though they were the last drop off of the day. Ugh. I still have that decision hanging over my head. That puts me at end of may 2024.

 Spent a couple months drafting my reply to the board with the lawyers. Then decided to take time off. Had a few months off then had an epic trip to europe. So that puts me to end of August 2024. I start volunteering in september at a therapeutic riding center to get away from vet stuff and I love it, but still super depressed and burnt out. I do some vet stuff like online CE, ive attended two conferences, dental CE videos, read a couple of common cases youll see as new grad books and written notes on them, and became RECOVER certified again. Then kind of get busy with the holidays. I help my mom out with her parents house (her moms a hoarder) and try to clear stuff away. I go on walks but mostly Im fighting depression. I finally got an accurate diagnsosis for something else (a movement disorder), but it impacts my ability to stand still so I worry about surgery and there arent good treatment options. I also have neck spasms in certain positions and Im supposed to get botox for that soon but they didnt do anything in vet school. Also had a trip to mexico in January. 

So that puts us to basically now. I think the burnout has eased. Not really the depression but that will always be an ongoing struggle. Now its just the huge confidence hit I took at corporate and continuing to lose because it feels like Im forgetting everything. 

My therapist thinks maybe I should try being a vet tech first. Or try some volunteer opportunities as a vet but I cant really think of any other than offering spay/neuter services which would stress me out too much. I also saw the person who offered me a job is looking for both a tech and a part time vet so maybe I could approach him as like a starting out as a tech and then transition back to easy cases/ pseudo internship thing or shadow or something. What the heck would I write in my cover letter or do I wait until in person? Thanks so much! ",2025-04-08 00:32:03+00:00,1,0

I have been getting migraines since about 11 years old and unfortunately, most medications have not worked.

I am currently on propranolol which has reduced the frequency of my migraines but I still get at least two per week and I’m considering other options. 

Just incase someone mentions botox, I’m not sure if botox would be a safe option for me given that I have a connective tissue disorder and a bunch of other health issues so I am not considering that option.

Or is Botox the solution to prevent the lines from continuing to grow?,2025-04-07 19:53:01+00:00,1,1
1jttlt0,TMJ,Has anyone done dry needling for TMJ Tension Headaches? (and other concerns),"Some people on this sub suggested it.

I quickly brought it up with my dentist last minute. 

They were fine with it being done on my forehead but below it.

Not the nose, cheek, chin?

Said something how's there's a lot of blood vessels there and irreversible damage.

Now I'm kind of scared.

I been having a big issue with my chronic headaches. Been having them since July 2024 and it progressively got worse.

Migraine helped a little but not anymore.

I tried Flexeril (muscle relaxer) and later Methylprednisolone (steroid taper) and it didn't help.

I did a steroid injection (two weeks ago) then a Botox injection procedure. (last week)

I heard Botox can take a week or two to work.

My headaches have an big impact on my mental health. I missed class for 3 weeks. Had to talk to the disability office about getting extensions on assignments. 

Heat and Ice doesn't help.

NSAIDs don't help.

Perhaps there's something else going on.

I started having neck pain three days ago. Two days after my Botox I found my constant headache to be extremely intense. No clue why.

I'm desperate for pain relief.

I see my neurologist tomorrow fortunately. Hopefully they can help.

Maybe it's more than just TMJ? 

My only symptom is pain across my forehead.

I remember when I used tiger balm for a few days on my jawline it helped a little bit.

But it lost efficacy. Other Topicals have zero effect.

No clue why. No clue what's going on.

My providers are stuck.",2025-04-07 19:14:49+00:00,1,3
1jttl1v,30PlusSkinCare,Considering Botox at 31?,"Hi everyone,

I turned 31 last month, and have recently started to notice more static lines on my forehead - never noticed these before but considering the Botox route.

I’ve been using a pretty regimented skin care routine with retinol for 5 years now - but that doesn’t seem to touch these. 

I had a consultation and looking at £360 for forehead and eyebrows (apparently doing only one area can distort your face?). Thinking about pulling the trigger but interested hear any success stories with these sort of minor lines and whether it’s worth it yet. I’m slightly
OCD about my skin, so I’ve been obsessing over the lines a little too much.

Thanks! ",2025-04-07 19:13:59+00:00,0,61

The center parts of my eyebrows are frozen like I can’t raise them but I still have slight movement at the tails and if I try to furrow them. I like the results of my forehead but I’ve noticed my eyelids are more hooded! I have less eyelid space when I’m doing my makeup and it feels like there’s just a lot of excess upper eyelid skin. I think I look more tired and puffy in the eyes. Am I experiencing a brow droop or is this something else?

1jtrtti,TrustandWill,I’m an assistant to an A-list celebrity and they just asked me to help draft their estate plan—some of their requests are...wild.,"I created a burner account because I need this job and I don't wanna violate my NDA—but I desperately need some advice.  
  
I work for a major celebrity. Often recognized in public, semi-frequent tabloid offender, ""has a fragrance""-level ego. You get the idea. So recently, my boss called me into their office, says I'm ""good at the paperwork stuff"", and asked if I could ""draft her estate plan""?! Is this legal? Apparerntly her last will was just written on a piece of legal paper and buried in a time capsule outside. Before you know it, I’m drafting bullet points for their legacy between scheduling collagen IV drips and reshoots for a streaming show that you might know.  
  
Here are just a few of the things they want included in their psychotic will:  
  
1. Their ashes are to be compressed into diamonds and launched into space… but only during a Mercury retrograde. Honestly, the easiest thing on this list.  
  
2. A life-sized wax figure of them should be installed at the Mel's diner in Hollywood, with pre-recorded phrases like “Good to see you again, darling.” The booth has to be permanently reserved, and the figure needs bi-monthly maintnance (AKA wax Botox).  
  
3. A clause preventing their second ex-spouse (not the first, they “like her now”) from attending the funeral. And I have to break the news to him, of course.  
  
4. An actual PET TRUST FUND for their capybara that includes annual wellness retreats, a raw vegan chef, and a stylist. There’s also a note that the capybara’s wardrobe is to be ""Y2K minimalist—no sequins, no feathers, no exceptions."" You think I'm kidding.  
  
5. If their memoir isn’t a New York Times bestseller within a year of publication, the ghostwriter (me??) will incur legal fees.  
  
I guess my question is...HOW DO I DO THIS?! Are pet trust funds real? Who do I ask about space cremation? Will Mel's diner honor this request?

My neurologist said he thinks it is my hypermobility spectrum disorder, and his best advice is to avoid any large stretches.   
  
He also started to think I had auto-immune perhaps (or it all was more-so autoimmune and incidental timing), which everything he tried tested negative, except for the few notes he made. He said he does not want to send me to rheumatology, because (despite being in an academic setting), the rheumatologists deny his referral into their clinics all the time.

1jti7nr,migraine,Experience with botox for episodic (10 to 12 days) migraines?,"Hi everyone! I wanted to know if anyone has any experience with botox for high frequency episodic migraines, if it works or is it a waste of money. 

I know that it is effective for people with chronic migraines, so over 15 migraine days, and that it doesn't do much for people with less frequent pain. I have around 10 to 12 migraine days a month, just below chronic, but enough to exhaust me. I've tried two preventatives but it's just getting worse and I'm running out of options. I'm overusing sumatriptans and I'm afraid that I'll get immune. I suspect that with the current rate in few years I'll get to chronic migraines, but I don't want to wait. Its already been taking a toll on everything in my life, I'm starting to get desperate. Still, botox is extremely expensive, so I won't try it without knowing that it would help. 

Please, if you know anything about it or have tried it yourself, I really need some help. This community has been invaluable to me. With so many doctors just prescribing me pills and sending me on my way, I knew nothing about actually dealing with the attacks. It's the first place I go when im feeling bad, and your knowledge has been more helpful than most neurologists I've dealt with. Thank you!

I finally realized how bad my eating habits had become and I couldn't seem to break them ( I binged on sugar and carbs after 8Pzm. I'd wake up at 2AM and eat 2 bowls of cereal). I just ate trash /binged after 8 every night. I knew I needed some help to stop. I decided i needed to get on Wegovy and nothing would stop me. 

After getting rejected by two physicians to prescribe a GLP-1, I decided I'd try the telehealth route (I'm 6'3"" amd my BMI didn't reach obese level...so the docs I saw said I wasn't a candidate for Wegovy). When I saw the telehealth doc, he said he would prescribe me something for weight loss but first I needed bloodworm. A few days later the results came back with an abnormal value...my A1-C was 5.8% making me just barely pre-diabetic. I already knew an overweight BMI plus a comorbidity made me a candidate. When I saw the doctor next we talked options and after understanding my challenges the doctor recommended Zepbound over Wegovy (I'd already checked about insurance coverage for weight loss meds from my insurance... weight loss meds not covered so I could take whatever I wanted as I would pat out of pocket)...I said let's do it.

I'm about to start my 4th month of shots (2.5 month one, 5.0 month two, 7.5 month three a day I have 10 mg vials on the way.  I have yet to have appetite suppression, don't really feel satiated quicker but the food noise is gone. I've cleaned my diet up. I don't eat after 8 or in the middle of the night (only a couple hiccups over 3  months). I eat smaller portions. I work out or play tennis 5 days a week. I get 7 hours of sleep a night. No side effects except for constipation (and I've learned how to manage that). Zepbound has put me on the right track. 

I got a compliment on my appearance from an old FWB on Snap today and it made me realize I really starting to  look  like the old me...the me I always was for 40 years. I won't be a buck 40 ever again, I begrudgingly accept that. I can be healthy again however. I will be healthy again.

The only thing is the wrinkles that I see in that pic I took today after gym/tan this morning. I didn't have those heavy. I get my face shot up with botox (actually Dysport the last two years) every 5 months but that won't fix those smile lines. I decided tonight that I'm gonna reward myself with fillers once I reach goal... the wrinkles aren't the end of the world but they are fixable and I'm gonna fix them.

Zep is a miracle drug. Reading people's stories on here make me so happy and motivated. The drug changes lives...I'm so thankful I found it. ",2025-04-07 09:27:03+00:00,72,4

I have since read that it can be common to get tox flu in the days or week following treatment, but can’t find anything on a general susceptibility.

I’ve had 4 sessions now. 

On top of the colds, I’ve had two very bad headaches at the base of my head/neck which I’ve not bad before - well, my migraines stopped happening about 20 years ago in my early 20’s.

1jtf7pc,TMJ,Need a bit of guidance :(,"Hi all,
I’ve had TMJ issues since October 2020(mild popping), and only got severe around the same time in 2021. I wore a mouth guard that made my symptoms worse, then got a splint beginning of 2022 that greatly helped and reduce or got rid of all my symptoms. I was stable from 22-24. Beginning last year my symptoms started to come back and it’s slowly gotten worse and now my splint doesn’t help anymore.

I’ve tried, Botox, PT, dry needling, and they all help but mildly, I recently got a new splint with new scans but I only wore it for 2-3 days since it made my symptoms worse, the last night I wore it I could feel my jaw muscles get so tight, so I stopped and went back to the old one, but my bite if shifting, the appliance makes it so only the front teeth touch, and holds the jaw forward, and It worked great before, but now my back molars are touching even with the splint, when before I had maybe a half a finger of space between the molars. I went to two oral surgeons who said I need a joint replacement(working on that now) but just trying to get stable again until surgery. If anyone has any suggestions, I could try using the splint again but I’m afraid it’ll make it worse. Also oral surgeons said to stop using it and to use a mouth guard, but I’ve tried those before and they didn’t help, so idk, what do y’all think? I’m going next week for a records appt to get started on the TMJ replacement.",2025-04-07 07:00:47+00:00,2,0

1jtamlj,MedSpa,Marketing Lessons Learned from helping my wife grow her injector business and building a medspa directory,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to share some insights I’ve gained from two key experiences: helping my wife (Spanish speaking) grow her business as an injector and building [**Cuidocs.com**](http://Cuidocs.com), a directory connecting Spanish-speaking patients with medspas and injectors.

These experiences have taught me a lot about the challenges local aesthetic businesses face in marketing—and how collaboration and strategy can help overcome them.

# Economies of scale in marketing matter a lot

One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned is how **economies of scale** impact marketing success. Large companies can afford to invest heavily in branding, advertising, and content creation because they operate across multiple markets, spreading costs across a wider audience. For example:

* Big chains can produce professional video content, run nationwide ad campaigns, and hire specialized teams for SEO, social media, and email marketing—all while staying profitable.
* Local medspas, however, often don’t have the resources to compete at this level. Without the ability to scale across multiple markets, it’s hard to justify the same level of investment.

This challenge is one of the reasons I started Cuidocs. I believe that by creating a network of reliable medspas and injectors, we can replicate the benefits of scale for smaller businesses. By working together under one platform, we can pool resources, share knowledge, and collectively reach more patients—especially underserved groups like the Hispanic community.

# Breaking Down Marketing: Acquisition, Retention, and Referrals

From my experience building Cuidocs and helping my wife with her practice, I’ve found that focusing on three key areas—**acquisition**, **retention**, and **referrals**—is essential for growth:

# 1. Acquisition

* **Google My Business (GMB)**: A well-optimized GMB profile is one of the most cost-effective ways to attract local patients. Include professional photos, bilingual descriptions, and encourage reviews from happy clients.
* **Omnichannel Content Strategy**: Start with YouTube-first organic content (great for education) and repurpose it into blog posts, Instagram reels, TikTok videos, and more. This approach stretches your content further without requiring constant new material.
* **Local Partnerships**: Collaborate with complementary businesses like gyms or salons for cross-promotions or co-hosted events. Be cautious about paying for leads—it’s prohibited in some states due to anti-kickback laws. Instead of paying directly for referrals or leads, focus on mutually beneficial partnerships that involve shared promotions or events rather than monetary exchanges tied to patient referrals.
* **Directories**: Listing your business in specialized directories like Cuidocs can help you tap into new audiences without having to invest heavily in ads.

# 2. Retention

* Use personalized communication channels like email, SMS, or WhatsApp to stay connected with your patients. Share exclusive specials or reminders about follow-up treatments to keep them engaged.
* Always ask for feedback after treatments—it not only improves patient satisfaction but also gives you insights into how you can improve your services.

# 3. Referrals

* Word-of-mouth remains one of the most powerful growth channels in aesthetics. Incentivize referrals by offering rewards (like discounts or free add-ons) for both the referrer and the new client—but ensure compliance with state laws around referral programs. Avoid any structure that resembles paying directly for leads or referrals as this could violate anti-kickback laws in healthcare settings. Instead, focus on creating referral programs that reward loyalty without crossing legal boundaries.
* Make the referral process easy by providing patients with referral codes or links they can share via email or social media.

# Agencies vs Freelancers vs In-house teams

One of the decisions any medspa or injector needs to make is how to handle marketing. Here are my thoughts based on experience:

* **In-House Team**: If you can afford it, having an internal team is the best way for building unique market intelligence tailored to your business. However, this requires significant revenue to support multiple specialists across channels. You can't have one single person to do everything, you need specialists to win. The benefit is complete control over your strategy and a deeper understanding of your ICP.
* **Agencies**: Specialized agencies that focus on aesthetics can be a good option, especially if they limit their client base within your geographic area (so you don't have much competition). They bring diverse expertise and can execute campaigns efficiently, but you may lose some flexibility and personalization.
* **Freelancers**: Freelancers can deliver excellent results at lower costs compared to agencies, but finding the right one takes time. Keep in mind that they may not have the same level of commitment as an employee or agency partner.

If you’re considering doing it yourself, I highly recommend reading *Who Not How* by Dan Sullivan and Dr. Benjamin Hardy. The book emphasizes the importance of finding the right “Whos” to help you achieve your goals rather than trying to do everything yourself—a mindset shift that’s been transformative for me.

If you are interested, I can share a set of interview questions, just DM me. There are so many shady agencies trying to get Medspas and doctors money that deliver poor results. Key questions here is referrals from other clients, their retention and experience in each of the different three key areas (acquisition, retention, referrals).

# Lessons from building Cuidocs

When creating Cuidocs, I realized how underserved the Hispanic market is in aesthetics. Many patients are looking for providers who understand their cultural preferences and speak their language but don’t know where to start. By focusing on education and connecting patients with trusted providers, we’re trying to bridge this gap while helping practices grow organically.

At the same time, Cuidocs aims to give smaller medspas access to scale-like benefits by working together as a network. By pooling resources and sharing visibility under one platform, we can help local businesses compete with larger chains while maintaining their independence.

# Final Thoughts

If you’re a local medspa owner or injector wondering how to balance acquisition, retention, and referrals effectively while staying profitable and compliant, collaboration might be your best path forward.

I was thinking some sort of light filler for the mouth lines? But am concerned of migration over time and it changing the shape of my smile...saw some comments about PRP Microneedling? Is one treatment sufficient enough for this?

1jt0wl6,MedSpa,Sign the Petition🚨,"--- Letter to the Public Health Committee Chair ----
Mr. Crownover,
Three bills have recently been referred to your committee that could seriously disrupt, if not entirely shut down, many med spas throughout the state if passed in their current form.
As of 2023, there were approximately 2,000 med spas operating in Texas. We estimate these bills would shut down about 90% of those med spas, many of which are Texas small businesses, and put their employees out of work.
All three bills would also take a great leap backward in established medical practice by severely restricting the ability of physicians to delegate to physician assistants (""PAs"") and nurse practitioners (NPs""). These bills threaten patient access, thousands of businesses, and professional autonomy.

1jrizs3,30PlusSkinCare,Thoughts on HALO laser treatments?,"Has anyone tried the HALO laser treatments? I had a consultation today for treatment of smile lines and just how to overall perk my skin up and look a bit younger (I'm 35, no previous beauty treatments done, occasional smoker at music festivals, and daily sunscreen wearer) and I was recommended either three sessions of microneedling with exosomes or one single HALO laser treatment because the smile lines are very minimal and the nurse at the plastic surgery center said she isn't going to recommend Botox or filler because she doesn't think that I would benefit from that nor would they give me the results that I want. She gave me a bunch of information and pamphlets about the HALO laser but I'm curious to see if anyone has had experience with the HALO laser and how it went for them. How painful was your treatment and how was your healing process? Did it give you the results that you wanted?

1jrgaoc,SkincareAddiction,[misc] Very confused Medspa Newbie! What do I choose?,"Hey everyone!

So I got a gift card to a nice medspa for my birthday last year. Fast forward one year and we're at today...and I have still not used the gift card. Mostly because I've overwhelmed with not knowing anything about what kind of treatments to get, or what they do, or what would be the best skin concern to tackle first.

I've included some pics of my skin.
My main concerns are:

-Deep lines between my eyebrows 
-Deep wrinkles on forehead when I smile or raise my eyebrows (which I do a lot) 
-redness and textured skin with tiny pimples and some enlarged posed on cheeks and chin. These areas often become more enflamed than they appear in these pictures and there will be a definitive much lighter line of skin between the red area and my nose.

-weak jawline/double chin. I was actually originally going to use this gift card for Kybella to get rid of the double chin and went to far as to have a consult with the doc at this medspa about it..however he suggested that Kybella wouldn't fix the problem and instead I should do fillers in my jar to strengthen it's appearance as fat under the jaw isn't actually what's causing it to appear the way it is. 

I have 1000$ gift card to spend and would be able to spend a little more for whatever treatment I decide on, if necessary

Soooooo. If it were you, what would you do? 

Sincerely,
A girlie with year long decision paralysis",2025-04-04 16:36:04+00:00,1,2
1jrfs4u,MedSpa,What are your strategies for “after photos” for marketing?,"We are a well established Medspa with a loyal patient base but have a tremendous issues with our patients allowing us to use photos for marketing even if we make it anonymous.  Do you have any strategies for how to talk to patients about this?

Also, do you have a strategy for taking consistent photos? I feel even though we’ve set up protocols with our staff, the photos are consistently inconsistent quality wise so even if we get after photos with a willing patient, they often aren’t usable for marketing standards. We are using TouchMD  for photos. 

Thank you!! ",2025-04-04 16:14:45+00:00,1,5
1jr5ofp,StocksElevatorPitches,Bet on vanity: Evolus,"Well as the world seem to go down into chaos, I have a few names I wrote about holding up quite well, DSM-Firmenich or Grindr for example.

More recently I spent time on Evolus (USD 777m market cap), a disruptor in aesthetic beauty with their botox competitor Jeuveau. They took 13% market share (\*) in the span of 5 years in the US by targeting younger consumers and being slightly more affordable. They also rode the medical spa opening growth, as those clinics were not already working with sector leaders Abbvie and Galderma.

The company is aiming to grow revenue at least +26% p.a. by 2028 and they are at the inflection point to be cash positive this year. Pretty exciting stuff if they can deliver. Management comes from Abbvie who owns botox, so quite solid and they know the market inside out.

They are mainly going to grow through their new filler offering which they secure from Symatese (the company behind Galderma fillers) and from international expansion in Europe.

As far as I understand tariffs will not be applied on pharmaceuticals products so their importations from Korea and France should not be affected. The company has a 70% gross margin and scale should bring it to be FCF positive this year.

Valuation is difficult given most metrics are negative, but basically if they deliver on their 700m sales by 2028 I model about 77m of EBITDA and looking at mature companies in their space (Galderma+cash pay therapeutics like Align) it should be trading around 15x so USD 1.1bn EV take out 33m of net debt and that gives you a USD 1.0bn market cap or a nice +42% price increase over the next two years.

The main risk of course Consumer softness which would get people to postpone/cancel their treatments, but my understanding is that it shows quite quickly, and people are vain so across the cycle it should be fine.

1jr5l8s,30PlusSkinCare,Botox and muscle tightness in forehead,"I’ve had Botox three times in my forehead, specifically targeting the frontalis, the corrugator supercilii, procerus, and orbicularis oculi muscles.

Each time I end up with a very tight, tense feeling in what I believe to be my right corrugator supercili muscle. The area above the inner eyebrow also seems to be slightly bulkier than it was previous to starting Botox. I’m not sure why this keeps happening and why it is only on the right side. Could it be that my right corrugator muscle is more dominant and therefore, needs more Botox to settle it? 

I’m a little afraid to add more Botox there because I’m worried about the eyebrow drooping or raising or simply that something will go wrong by adding more.

Have you ever experienced this and what was the solution?",2025-04-04 06:45:24+00:00,2,3

1jqs04d,Medicalaesthetics,Aesthetic Clinics Owners  – Building a New Patient Acquisition & Retention Platform Would You Use It?,"I’m looking to connect with Aesthetic Clinic & MedSpa owners to help validate and shape a tech product I’m developing.

An online platform to help generate more high-quality leads and improve patient retention.

Quick Overview of the Platform & Value Proposition:

Patient Acquisition & Retention (Beyond Directories) details go directly to the clinic via email or WhatsApp.

We don’t just list clinics; we create a virtual browsing/shopping experience where patients can research treatments and explore clinics in an engaging way.

Optimizing Clinics’ Existing Content (Without Extra Work)

Clinics spend heavily on social media ads, yet platforms like Instagram/TikTok make discovery difficult.

We reutilize clinics’ paid ads and organic social content—embedding their content in data-rich profiles that are searchable, filterable, and localized.

Smart Lead Nurturing & Retargeting

Consumers who browse but don’t book immediately can be retargeted dynamically with

Introductory discounts, Loyalty-based offers and block treatment booking incentives to drive higher-value appointments.

Automated lead tracking gives clinics insights on inquiries, visits, and conversions.

No need for clinics to create additional content—we optimize their existing marketing to drive bookings.

Allows doctors to simultaneously educate, demonstrate specialist authority and lead capture using a Q&A feature.

Clinics can control their own dynamic pricing & special offers (e.g., flash sales, VIP discounts, seasonal promotions).

Leads are sent directly to the clinic (email, WhatsApp, or a CRM integration).

Consumers can book directly via our platform integrated into existing systems. 

QUESTIONS:

Would this be valuable to your clinic?

Do you already use something similar?

What would be the major questions you would ask to qualify whether this would be interesting to sign up?

What features/services/integrations would be most important?


Happy to go into details (pricing, mechanics, etc.) via DM if you’re interested. Honest feedback welcome—brutal or otherwise!

I’ve always associated tipping with the service industry (salon, restaurants, etc.), and I’m a generous tipper in those settings. But in a medical setting, it feels a little confusing—especially when appointments are super short (mine are usually 5–10 minutes) and I assume the nurses are salaried professionals.

There also seems to be some unspoken pressure to tip at my MedSpa, which adds to the confusion.

If you’re a nurse working in a MedSpa, do you expect tips? Or if you’re a client, what’s your experience been?

So, I dunno, for my situation it seems like injections are going to do more harm to me mentally and financially than they would benefit me. But I'm also (neurotically) worried about the future and what the beauty landscape will look like in the future and it's making me really self conscious. 

Pls tell me I'm crazy and not to go for it! (If you're a ridiculously stunning eternally youthful model or under 30, skip this one. Love you tho, keep on keeping on) ",2025-04-03 01:00:10+00:00,34,122
1jq4zdt,WellnessMarketing,Seal High-Value Deals: Start Winning Big in Aesthetic Medicine,"[A calming consultation unfolds in a high-end Medspa, blending expertise with a soothing vibe.](https://preview.redd.it/nschrnnhpise1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea4afb9026bf8982e698d972a952bcdf86c8cacd)

  
***Let’s cut the noise:*** landing top-tier clients in your wellness business takes more than high-visibility ads. It’s about winning their trust and securing long-term buy-in. Your clients aren’t just booking a session—they’re investing in a lifestyle. How do you make that a no-brainer? Tailored packages, affordable payment options, and a vibe that keeps them coming back. This isn’t fluff—it’s how to turn prospects into loyal followers.

Frame treatments as smart investments. Break costs down into easy chunks. Own free consults. Flex your skills. Nail follow-ups. Create an experience that justifies every dime.

# 1. The Wellness Win: Go Long-Term

Your aesthetic services aren’t quick fixes—they’re life upgrades. Sell them that way. Spotlight the lasting perks, not just a one-off boost. How do you pitch your practice as their beauty and health MVP?

# 2. Crush the Cost Barrier

High prices can freak clients out. Chop them down. Flexible payments aren’t a bonus—they’re a must in aesthetic medicine. Turn a “not now” into a “heck yes” with a plan they can handle. What’s your move to make premium care feel easy?

**Real Deal:** A client hesitates at a $1,500 treatment. You break it into $300 monthly bites. Just like that—they’re sold. Is your clinic knocking this out of the park?

# 3. Free Consults: Your Trust Hack

Consultations aren’t sales traps—they’re your chance to shine. Explain it simply, ease their worries, and prove you’ve got their back. Are you using these to lock in Medspa loyalty?

# 4. Show Your Skills: Proof That Sells

Clients want to know you’re legit. Flash your cred—think jaw-dropping before-and-afters, killer reviews, or that fancy certification. How do you make your aesthetic & wellness business the obvious pick?

# 5. Follow-Up Like a Pro: Keep the Momentum

They leave—don’t let them ghost. Hit them with a custom offer or a “we’ll squeeze you in” fix. It’s not extra—it’s how your practice seals the deal.

**Real Talk:** A client says “maybe later.” You text a personalized plan with a flexible slot. They book. What’s your go-to follow-up play?

# 6. The “Wow” Factor: An Unforgettable Experience

From the first contact to the final touch, every moment matters. It’s more than a sleek space—it’s about making clients feel like VIPs. How do you turn your aesthetic medicine spot into a deal-clinching gem?

# Your Next Victory: Loyalty That Pays

Time to be honest. Are you doing all of the above, every single time, with every lead, and every client. In addition to this, are you keeping your audience not just engaged, but enraptured?

This isn’t about one sale—it’s about a patient base that sticks around. Show your Medspa isn’t just a stop—it’s where they transform. How will you crank up your strategy and land those high-value wins?

First-time poster! I work in corporate sales and want to start a side hustle where I manage in-home injectables (Botox, filler). My corporate manager said her friend does this in SF. I’m located in another major metro city.

1jpw5rr,FacebookAds,How TF did i manage to 10x ROAS out of nowhere???,"Mainly just posting this to vent.

Last year i started advertising for our local medspa service, specifically Facials.

Running grand opening offer for 50% off all facials

Was costing $120-150 to get each purchase (sale goal, optimized for online purch/booking)

This was pretty bad, as the facial at 50% off was leaving us with around $50-90 gross profit. (so losing money for new clients)

Which wouldn't be so bad if these clients returned for another facial more than once, which they didn't (completely separate issue)

Couple months later, ran black friday ads with the same offer. same results, $120-150/purchase

**Then a few months go by, with different offers (30% off new clients, free x when you book y, etc)**

Costing astronomical amounts for these campaigns, losing wayyy too much money($200-250/purch)

**FAST FORWARD 2 MONTHS OF NO ADVERTISING**

Present day, 2 days ago i copied the original campaigns from the grand opening, with a VERY similar yet slightly better creative

ONLY changes:

\-Slightly different creative

\-15 Year anniversary offer, rather than grand opening (same 50% off)

I have literally gotten 12 new bookings within 2 days, **now costing \~$13 PER PURCHASE**

Somehow we are now profitable on the acquisition of a 50% off offer

Also i made a another copy of the campaign which had slightly different targeting, and a cost per purchase goal (of $80/purch) **WHICH IS GETTING 4$/PURCHASE**

I understand that there is way too many changes to know what caused the results, not only changes in our business but also meta.

not complaining, but HOW AND WHY DID THIS HAPPEN?????

TDLR; Over a few months. Cost per purchase went from $150 to $15 , in the same adset with very minor changes. out of nowhere. wtf",2025-04-02 18:36:33+00:00,10,8

The plastic surgeon I was seeing in DC (before I moved) participated in Allē which is basically what I would equate to a punchcard but for fillers and botox 💀. 

I’m super hesitant to leave my tried and true provider because she is brutally honest and tells me what I should do to maintain and enhance my natural beauty as opposed to doing what I tell her. 

However, I cannot justify running to DC and taking days off whenever I feel like my forehead botox is wearing off. I want to find another provider that will be real with me and uphold my request to keep me looking like ME.  

Anyone have any recommendations?

1jpg3xi,30PlusSkinCare,"Paid $700 for Botox, Did Not Get Anywhere Close to What I Wanted","I visited SkinSpirit in California for Botox, my first experience, back in October. It was expensive, about $650, but the results were good, I can't remember exact units, maybe 40ish. The injector had to touch it up a couple weeks later due to ""Spock brows"" ($130, with some free units), but after that, it looked great. I was happy with the results, despite a frozen forehead, as it made me look 5 years younger.

I returned for a re-treatment 5 months later, as the Botox was fading, though not entirely gone. I asked for more brow movement this time but to target the horizontal forehead lines, the 11s, the line above my right eyebrow, and the crows feet... Ended up paying $660, so a little more than my first visit. However, a couple weeks later, I noticed problem lines that I thought she was going to target, including horizontal lines and 11s. I specifically asked the nurse to address these, but the results were not as expected. It's been about 16 days (ie over 2 weeks)...

At this point, I’m out $700 and can't afford another touch-up. I don’t plan on returning to SkinSpirit because the cost is too high, but I’m unsure how to approach them about the unsatisfactory result. I expected a nurse to manage a bit of brow movement while addressing the lines I pointed out. The nurse was delightful, but the pricing and outcome don’t align. Botox shouldn't cost almost $1,000 right? Any advice on how to reach out to them?

Thanks. Photos

1jp00g4,Esthetics,Mud slinging in the industry,"Does anyone else here think the mud slinging between the invasive, science-based medspa world and the holistic organic world is getting completely ridiculous???

I personally think there is a lucrative market for both and the attempt to convert one or the other is useless. I personally prefer the organic holistic methods but that is simply my preference because I love it and I have health conditions that contraindicate me for many advanced procedures and modalities. However, I strongly dislike the whole green-washing and ""clean skincare"" movement. It's not authentic and I think that it's the fluff people are talking about that makes our side of the industry look phony. The demonization of science backed procedures, skincare, and technology is ridiculous. First off, everything is a chemical. Second, natural ingredients contain allergens and sensitizers too and can still cause reactions if there is overexposure and misuse. Also, organic is not as ""clean"" and ""cruelty-free"" as people think, but that's a story for another day.

On the other hand, the other side of the industry shits on holistic organic in some pretty stupid ways too and make people believe that it's not efficacious, which is not true. Many people are misinformed about this side of the industry. Holistic care is a longer journey that can produce the same clinical results, but it's gradual and gentler. It also uses methods that can address other contributers to skin conditions and also supports preventative measures. I don't think it's for anyone who wants immediate, drastic, clinical results in one or a few sessions. I think there's nothing wrong with either, just 2 completely different target customers. 

Also, many organic brands ARE science backed. There is simply not a very good understanding or education about it. I had a guy at the conference try to sell me on a brand and was trying to convince me that there's no such thing as truly organic skincare because truly organic shelf life is about 2 weeks. Little did he know that I'm a formulator and organic is not determined by shelf life. Organic means that at least 98% of the ingredients and formula are naturally derived from ingredients that are not preserved on the farm with pesticides. That's all it means.(it does not mean COMPLETELY pesticide-free) Also, there are 2 ways to preserve organic products: (1) synthetic preservatives containing parabens because it's the only way to extend the shelf life to 2 years for mass production (that's the 2% that isn't organic) or (2) natural preservative that are pesticide-free but only extend shelf life to 6 months.(that's what brands who produce small batches use). I also had someone tell me that organic means you can't use water in your formulas 😂 absolutely nonsense. Again, that is not the definition of organic and you absolutely can use water. Most organic products are emulsions and you can't make emulsions without both oil and water. I think people just say anything 🙄 but I also love microdermabrasion, laser, dermaplaning, etc, (I just don't prefer invasive for myself) but all of these methods are absolutely amazing.

I definitely think there is a market segment of consumers who are undeserved because holistic organic is doing it wrong, however, that's a broader problem in the industry as a whole. The gimmicks and marketing fluff are cringey. Brands are out here miseducating people or exaggerating things, using buzz words and ridiculous influencer trends. Who tf came up with the beef tallow shit??? 🤦🏽‍♀️

1joimmt,u_UsedConnection4428,Mindset is Everything,"In a world filled with countless people, what truly makes us different? I believe it’s the mindset we choose to adopt. We all navigate a terrain of triumphs and adversities. How we interpret and respond to these experiences carves out our individuality.

This concept of unique perspective is particularly relevant in the aesthetics industry. We’re not simply promoting treatments; we’re crafting narratives that resonate with those seeking confidence, well-being, and a sense of self. Originality is paramount.

Consider each patient who walks through your medspa doors. They bring with them distinctive backgrounds, insecurities, and aspirations. They’ve faced their own challenges, and their worldview shapes how they see beauty and self-care.

As marketers, our role isn’t to impose a singular definition of desirability. It’s to understand and respect the diversity that our clients bring. We must create content that acknowledges their singular journeys and celebrates their exclusive viewpoints.

This means moving beyond surface-level messaging and delving into their emotional landscape. It means writing stories that echo their personal experiences.

Rather than concentrating only on physical changes, we can emphasize emotional resilience and self-discovery that often accompanies aesthetic treatments. We can showcase the transformations of those who have overcome adversity and found empowerment.

By embracing different outlooks, we create a more inclusive and authentic brand. We build trust, demonstrating that we understand and value each person’s journey.

Moreover, our own standpoints as marketers can shape the way we approach our work. We can view challenges as opportunities for growth and setbacks as lessons learned. We can see client interactions as opportunities for real connection.

By cultivating a positive and empathetic frame of mind, we create a more fulfilling and impactful marketing experience. We build a brand that resonates with authenticity and fosters true connections.

Ultimately, it’s our chosen vantage point that sets us apart. It’s the lens through which we view the world, the stories we tell, and the connections we forge. In the wellness industry, this can be a powerful tool. It helps build a business that is genuine and life-changing.",2025-04-01 00:24:40+00:00,1,0

1jo9pj9,Melasmaskincare,"After spending $4k on treatments, my skin is a disaster. SOS!","Sorry for the weird emojis, wanted to conceal my identity a little bit!

I’ve posted before and was told my skin wasn’t “that bad” — I think it’s bad considering I’ve spent $4k (not counting “medical grade skincare) within a couple months to address the pigment under my eyes. Not to mention, my skin tone, pores and discoloration has never been worse. 

**I’ve never been diagnosed with melasma. I’ve ASKED my derm and medspa licensed doctors and nurses if it was melasma. Some said yes, some said no. I’m wondering if this is hyperpigmentation caused by laser treatments or is this actual melasma??

I had four MOXI treatments followed by one HALO treatment and this is what my skin looks like. The last treatment was three months ago, so it should be healed.

Previous to that, I was prescribed HQ and followed directions religiously. It destroyed my skin. I was told I got a chemical burn. 

Any suggestions or information would be helpful. I’m at a loss after all the money I’ve spent and my face looks far far worse than it ever has. And I always wear spf and a hat. ",2025-03-31 18:04:36+00:00,28,82

We offer Aquagold at our clinic but am hoping for any tips that other providers may have in terms of best combination of products to put in the treatment vial.  This seems like a great opportunity to customize treatment for patients and so I understand if it varies a bit per patient, but is there any specific products (or dose) you use that reliably gives great results?

On a related note, what are your expectations for duration of effect?  Their marketing claims 3-4 months and I presume this is because toxin is included in the vial but in practice we don’t typically see patients get this duration.

1jo44ee,Rosacea,Derm visit this week - how to get the most out of it,"Hi - relative newbie here, and I appreciate all I've learned from you! So glad this community is here. 

I've been struggling with redness/pustules/bumps for about 18 months. When I saw my derm last year, she diagnosed Type 1/2 rosacea, but didn't really prescribe anything for it. I had a bunch of other body part issues going on, so didn't have much time in the appt to pursue. I'm seeing her this week for my annual skin scan, and REALLY want to get more info on my rosacea, which has gotten mildly worse since I saw her last. 

(Feeling low about my increased rosacea and other skin aging aspects, I recently went to a ""medspa"" and can't believe I let myself get taken in by their promises of their treatment and the ZO line - what a big, costly lesson learned that I will write about in another post.)

Maybe I need a new derm - someone who specializes more in rosacea - but this current doc has been so good for addressing and resolving other things over the years. She has a terrific demeanor, good listener etc, that I want to give this another shot w/ her. 

What questions to ask her? If it's possible, I want to address root cause(s) as well as symptoms.

I want to be more proactive about the rosacea and advocate for myself.  Your suggestions for how to get the most out of my appointment would be so helpful.

Thanks!!",2025-03-31 14:11:18+00:00,14,5

1jns91x,30PlusSkinCare,Skin getting red for no reason?,"Hi!  I (32F) have always had pretty good skin.  

Part of this is due to the fact that since I was about 14, I've carried and worn sunscreen due to a family history of skin cancer.  I also have had a pretty intensive skin care routine that's worked for me and included retin-A, and have gotten botox since I was 24.  I also get bi-monthly facials at Silver Mirror.  

This is not meant as a humble brag but to show how good my skin has been.  I've gotten free or reduced price injections and procedures due to how my skin looked, which was often before my procedures, so that places I've gone to could use my photos in before/afters.  I also get constantly asked how much younger I am than my actual twin sister, who has not used retin or sunscreen and who has smoked/drank for over 10 years.  

Over night, my skin suddenly changed.  I have had no diet changes, no skin care changes, no external stressors but starting in early Jan, my skin has been noticeably red and inflamed from my entire face to a line down my neck.  

I tried doing a skin care elimination and stopped the stronger products but I still had the same issues.  I went to two dermatologists and a regular doctor and did patch testing and went on what I think was a steroid but nothing has changed.  I am now really worried that I've somehow ruined my skin after being so careful with it for years.  

Has anyone had anything like this in their 30s?  Weird red rough skin out of nowhere?  I'm happy to update with before and afters since the difference is so extreme.  ",2025-03-31 01:42:07+00:00,1,0

1jn1lph,30PlusSkinCare,My cheek filler led to painful and serious complications - a review 4 years later.,"Almost four years ago, I had filler placed in my cheek that ended up turning into multiple, painful complications. I finally wrote a negative review for the injector and clinic who performed the injections, and decided I would share it here with names/details removed in case this story is helpful for anyone (if you want the details, though, please message me). If you are going through similar filler complications, feel free to message me for help or support. The edited review starts below:

As patients, we all inherently assume some level of risk whenever we decide to undergo any cosmetic procedure, whether surgical or nonsurgical. Ideally, in such cases, where the risks become the reality, providers are able to handle complications with timely, capable, and compassionate care. Unfortunately, that was not my experience when I developed painful complications after receiving dermal fillers with [clinic name removed]. I am writing this review almost 4 years after the event to share my story, and to hopefully serve as a reminder to be cautious when choosing where to entrust your wellbeing.

In late August of 2021, I had Restylane Lyft with Lidocaine injected into my right zygomatic (cheek) area in efforts of achieving a more balanced facial appearance. Immediately afterwards, I developed extreme pain in the injected area and the chronic inability to fully open my mouth (trismus). My right jaw joint began popping in and out of place and, within a day, it could no longer open to its normal maximum opening. The pain in the injected area became more intense with chewing, talking, and smiling, and eventually became so debilitating that I could no longer talk for extended periods of time or eat solid foods.

About three weeks after the injection, in September of 2021, I sought help from my original injector, but was informed that he was on a medical trip outside of the country until October. In the meantime, I was deferred to other injectors and surgeons at the clinic. One surgeon insisted that it couldn’t be the filler and advised me to take a therapeutic (high and extended) dose of ibuprofen. He suggested that it must be a separate TMJ issue, despite the fact that I had never experienced TMJ issues before and that the symptoms had come on suddenly and acutely immediately following the filler injection. I saw one of their head injectors twice - the first time she suggested taking prednisone to resolve any lingering inflammation, but I declined. The second time I saw her, I was so desperate for relief that I decided to take the prednisone, only to experience extreme insomnia and no long-term relief from symptoms. I also reached out to another injector via her Instagram account for advice (one who had previously injected my lips), but she insisted that I work with my original injector. I later discovered that she refuses to book me for any further appointments.

When I was finally able to meet with my original injector in October of 2021, he said that he could try dissolving the filler, but then said that he could not remember where he had injected it. And that his notes only said “cheek”. Feeling totally failed by [clinic name removed], and in debilitating pain, I decided to seek help from an outside injector, who specialized in ultrasound-guided filler dissolving. I also sought help from an ENT, who ordered an ultrasound of the area, which showed that filler had been injected directly in/surrounding a facial nerve. After two ultrasound-guided dissolving sessions with the outside injector, the filler was dissolved and the pain in the injected area dissipated.

At this point, though the nerve pain in the injected area was resolved thanks to the outside injector, the jaw joint issues (trismus, pain) had persisted and worsened. In November 2021, I returned to my original injector and reported the continuing symptoms to him. I asked him for help, and he performed additional dissolving sessions. This led to periods of temporary muscular relief following each dissolving session, potentially due to the dry-needling effects of the injections or potentially due to the anti-inflammatory effects of the dissolving agent. Regardless, the issues remained unresolved, and I made the decision to seek professional medical help from an Oral & Maxillofacial surgeon. In early 2022, I travelled out of state to undergo bilateral TMJ arthroscopic surgery with a specialist. The surgery was partially successful, but, in late 2024, the joint condition worsened and developed osteoarthritis, to the point of needing complete jaw joint replacement with a prosthetic joint.

In reflecting upon the facts of what took place in 2021, I am dissatisfied and disappointed with the poor level of aftercare that I experienced at [clinic name removed]. Until just recently, I had continued to visit my original injector for forehead Botox treatments. However, in contemplating how I was and have been treated at [clinic name removed], I finally decided it would be best to take my business elsewhere and write a review.

My story is an extreme one, but if you take anything from it, let it be to please be careful in deciding who you let inject you. I found out the hard way that, when something goes wrong, there is very little support available outside of your original injector. In my experience, few medical professionals are willing to take on the liability of trying to help, and those that are willing are very expensive. Make sure that whoever injects you has proven that they are equipped to help you deal with complications in a timely, capable, and compassionate manner.",2025-03-30 01:26:48+00:00,298,38
1jn1iej,30PlusSkinCare,Undereye Botox made my eyes emotionless!,"Hi all,

I've been getting botox for about 1.5 years now with the same injector. I always get the same thing, 11s and forehead. 

This most recent appointment, I decided to ask for recommendations for undereye wrinkles since I've noticed them getting more pronounced. She suggested a small amount of botox right under my eyes. I can't remember how many units she said, I was just happy to hear that there was a solution! Or so I thought. 

I'm almost 2 weeks post treatment, and my eyes look completely void of emotion. When I smile, they don't move at all! The under eye area is also more hollow. I look like an emotionless robot that's aged 10 years. 

Had this happened to anyone? If so, how long did it take to go back to normal? Should I consider additional botox in a different area to fix it somehow?

1jn1b1g,tirzepatidecompound,Advice Needed!,"I started my journey in early December. I spent 3 months on Semaglutide and gained 5lbs. Never had any appetite suppression. I then switched to 5mg tirzepatide (2 weeks). Last Sunday, I upped my shot to 6mg. Within 3-4 hours, I had immediate appetite suppression. The food noise quieted and even small meals left me feeling like I had eaten Thanksgiving dinner for two. I’m due to give myself another shot tomorrow but now I’m wondering if I should A. go back down to 5mg or B. Space out my dosing and maybe go every 10 days? I had 2 protein shakes and a small salad today. Soon after I ate the salad, I began to feel like I had again, eaten a gigantic meal. I’m ok with this feeling, in fact, I’m still reeling that after all these months, I have finally experienced what others have talked about… appetite suppression. I was beginning to feel like a non responder. It feels good. My concern is, if I’m 20 hours away from my next scheduled dose and I still feel this much suppression, do I really need to dose again tomorrow? Shotsy says I have about 2.83mg in my system at the moment.

Three things that changed this week from previous injections are:
I switched from a MedSpa to BPI. Perhaps BPI is stronger than what I’ve been injecting?
I injected in my arm for the first time, I’ve always done my belly.
Lastly, as I stated, I went up 1mg this week.

Otherwise no notable side effects. Zero constipation, no heartburn (had a lot of that on sema).

Now, my smile is pretty much back to normal, but I still feel an odd, almost numb sensation on the left side of my face (cheek area) and mouth daily.

1jmpxi0,freelance_forhire,[Hiring] I'm looking for a Software Developer ($125-250/hr per client - Commission based),"We’re a New York–based AI startup currently hiring a full-stack developer to build a lead-generation and ad automation agent designed for service-based businesses (medspas, law firms, dental clinics, etc.).

Developers who successfully build and maintain our agent systems earn $1,000–$2,000+ per client, per month, with minimal ongoing work required. Just one client can earn you $12,000–$24,000 per year in passive income — we’ll handle the sales and delivery. You just need to build and keep the system running.

This translates to $125–$250/hour, assuming \~8 hours of development and light monthly maintenance — and that’s for *just one* client. If your system is used by multiple clients, this can grow exponentially. This is a real chance to double or triple your yearly income with one successful build.

Base compensation available: $250–$500 milestone-based, depending on project scope. Higher earnings available via performance-based revenue share ($1K–$2K/month per client system used)

What You’ll Build:

* A free-to-run AI agent that:
   * Sources warm B2B leads from platforms like LinkedIn, Reddit, and Google Maps.
   * Uses AI to initiate and qualify conversations (no paid API use).
   * Automatically generates ad copy and organic posts (not PPC).
   * Pushes leads into a CRM or Google Sheet for handoff.
   * Can scale across niches (e.g., realtors, medspas, law firms).

Tech Stack (Suggested):

* Python / Node.js
* Puppeteer or Playwright
* Ollama / Local LLMs (no OpenAI key)
* LangChain, vector DBs, free CRM APIs

You’ll Get:

* $1,000–$2,000 commission per client using your system
* Optional: 20% for keeping systems running
* Warm leads handed to you by our team
* Official NY-based business backing the product
* Zero cost to deploy — we only use free stacks, no hidden fees

*Important Note: To earn the full 30% commission, you must close the deal with the client. If you are unable to close the deal, we will split the commission 15%/15% between you and a sales closer. This means that you will still earn a significant amount for your work, but the sales closer will also receive a portion of the commission for their efforts in closing the deal.*

*Additionally, you will have the option to run the client-facing system that we will sell to our clients, which is separate from the lead generation and ad automation agent you will build. By choosing to run this system, you will be eligible to earn an extra 20% commission on top of your existing commission structure. This provides an opportunity for you to increase your earnings and further monetize your skills and expertise.*

Commission is paid monthly, per client assigned:

* If you are maintaining our agent and resolving any issues only:
   * *Starter Plan ($2,997/mo)* — $599.40/month (\~$75/hr estimate)
   * *Professional Plan ($3,997/mo)* — $799.40/month (\~$100/hr estimate)
   * *Premium Plan ($4,997/mo)* — $999.40/month (\~$125/hr estimate)
* If you are also demoing the agent and closing the deal:
   * *Starter Plan* — $1,498.50/month (\~$187/hr estimate)
   * *Professional Plan* — $1,998.50/month (\~$250/hr estimate)
   * *Premium Plan* — $2,498.50/month (\~$312/hr estimate)

Ideal For:

* Builders who like solving technical problems independently
* Anyone looking for a no-cap, commission-based structure that rewards performance and ownership

Interested? Message me directly with:

* Your portfolio or past work
* Links to GitHub (if applicable)
* A short message on why this is exciting for you

1jmcvav,jennandsasha,Recap of Jenn’s Stir The Pot episode,"There was kind of a lot in the episode and it went a little bit back and forth between subjects but I tried to keep it a little organized.

They are eating hot pot and going up spice levels throughout the episode. 

- [ ] Started off talking about Jenn’s background a little bit. She has lived in New Jersey, Boston, Wisconsin, Miami, and now LA

- [ ] They talked a little bit about her trip to Vietnam and spending time with all of her family. Says her whole family flew in to celebrate from all over.

- [ ] She said her family didn’t really get to watch the bachelor/bachelorette but her grandparents would watch her dances from DWTS on YouTube when they got uploaded.

- [ ] They talked a bit about the difference between dating in real life vs on reality tv. The main thing being you are getting judged by everyone when you are dating on tv.

- [ ] Also mentioned how it’s validating to have people who are watching the show back you up when it comes to toxic situations. 

- [ ] Jenn says she tries to remain humble and not read too much into comments whether they are good or bad.

- [ ] Says her TT comments are way nicer than IG comments.

- [ ] DWTS SECTION: They have the spicy finale rumba rehearsal clips playing in the background during this ✨

- [ ] Jenn says she had never danced before and has no rhythm but luckily she had a really good teacher 🥰

- [ ] She says it was one of the best experiences she had in her life especially after coming off the bachelorette. It helped build up her confidence.

- [ ] The rehearsals were 4 hours long but Jenn said she needed extra practice so her and Sasha did a lot of extra rehearsals. She said it was usually 8 hour days.

- [ ] She didn’t mind the rehearsals though because she was having so much fun. (I’m sure they were 😉)

- [ ] Brief little talk about astrology and their signs. 

- [ ] Jenn was asked about being the bachelorette a few weeks into Joey’s season airing. 

- [ ] She said it took her a bit to decide if she should do it or not. She talked to a lot of former bachelorettes and watched seasons of the show before deciding.

- [ ] She says she enjoyed filming the show and felt like she was level headed throughout the process.

- [ ] The stressful part was actually watching the show while it was airing and seeing everyone’s opinions.

- [ ] Her family was worried she was getting trafficked when she got casted for the bachelor 

- [ ] Says her mom was worried where her head was at when she decided to do the bachelorette.

- [ ] Ultimately her family was super happy for the representation Jenn brought to her community through being the bachelorette.

- [ ] Jenn said her mom would watch the show and text her about the episodes asking her sometimes “What were you doing with those guys” 😂

- [ ] She said her mom was really nervous to be filmed for the show so she memorized lines in English. Jenn wanted to speak in Vietnamese though and said her mom got so nervous that she forgot Vietnamese for a minute.

- [ ] She also said her mom and aunt definitely intimidated the guys on the show 🤣

- [ ] Kelli was talking about her daughter and asked Jenn where she would want to raise kids. Jenn says she changes her mind all the time but she loves LA and thinks she would raise kids there. 😏

- [ ] Jenn says she’s nervous people are gonna recognize her during her clinicals and ask for a picture lmao.

- [ ] She talks about having a lot of goals that she wants to accomplish and PA school is one of those.

- [ ] She worked really hard to get in and would have felt unfulfilled if she didn’t go back and finish school.

- [ ] She mentioned that her mom was in medical school but didn’t get to finish because she had to move to the US within a certain time frame. But actually her mom didn’t want her to go into the medical field 

- [ ] Says she loves helping people and she loves learning about medicine so that’s why she thinks she was drawn to the medical field.

- [ ] She mentions that there are a lot of opinions from people on what she should do with her future but she does what’s best for her. 

- [ ] She says that that she feels like she works really hard to fulfill her dreams as a way to give back to her mom for all the sacrifices she made for their family.

- [ ] Her and Kelli both mention that they feel much more similar to their moms now than they did when they were younger.

- [ ] Jenn made tiramisu for her and Kelli (it looked really good) 

- [ ] Jenn talks about how playing the piano relaxes her and mentions Sasha bought the piano for her 🩷

- [ ] She says she’s been teaching him how to play and he really likes it. She says she teaches him piano and he teaches her how to dance.

- [ ] Future plans: Jenn mentions she would like her own skincare line and would maybe want to open a medspa. (As an esthetician I would like to pitch myself for a job if she opens a medspa 😂)

And that is pretty much it! This is my first time doing one of these so I hope it was okay 🫶🏼

1jma2cs,WellnessMarketing,From Childhood Compliance to Medspa Marketing Mastery,"When I was five, my dreams weren’t about soaring among the stars or healing animals. Instead, my aspirations were a mirror of my parents’ desires. I didn’t have a distinct vision of my own. Yet, I had an innate ability to be outstanding in tasks that aligned with their expectations. This early acquiescence, though seemingly passive, laid the groundwork for my future success in business development.  
  
What’s fascinating is that whenever sales or marketing elements were shown in any activity, I naturally excelled. It wasn’t a conscious effort; I didn’t strategize or analyze. It was an intuitive understanding, a native ability to relate and persuade. This unconscious skill, honed through years working to please people, became the foundation of [my professional success](https://gianosagency.com/transforming-wellness-brands-proven-marketing-strategies/).  
  
This experience highlights a crucial aspect of effective marketing: genuine connection. It’s not always about aggressive tactics or manipulative techniques. It’s about corresponding with the needs and desires of others. In the medspa industry, this translates to empathizing with clients’ aspirations for self-care and confidence.  
  
My childhood experience taught me that an authentic bond is more powerful than any sales pitch. It’s about building trust, understanding unspoken wishes, and creating an experience that resonates on a deeper level. This approach is particularly relevant in the wellness industry. Patients seek not just treatments, but emotional validation and a sense of security.  
  
As I’ve transitioned into medical aesthetics marketing, I’ve realized something important. My unconscious sales ability helps with creating strategies that are both effective and authentic. I focus on building genuine relationships with clients, understanding their sentiments, and creating content that speaks to their aspirations.   
  
This approach allows me to create marketing campaigns that are not only successful but also deeply fulfilling. It’s about leveraging my innate ability to coalesce, and making a positive impact.  
  
In acknowledging my unique journey, I’ve learned to appreciate the power of authenticity and real relationships. It’s a reminder that our past experiences can shape our approach to everything. Even those seemingly unrelated events find their way into our current professions and contribute to our success.",2025-03-29 00:29:31+00:00,1,0
1jm9y2q,MedSpa,RN Medspa Compliance in California- MSO/PC Model?,"My mom is an RN who recently got her Botox and filler certification and is looking to open a medspa in California. We know that she would not be able to own more than 49 percent of the spa without the MSO/PC loophole. There is an MD we know who is willing to provide a lot of help with the setup, space, and the good faith exams, but he just wants to be paid a flat monthly fee for his services while my mom would be the one doing the injections (he would be on site since he has his own clinic that he is offering to rent us a few rooms in). 

My question is will we be legally compliant if we set up an MSO and divert money for expenses from the PC/MD account to the MSO account while just leaving the PC with a flat monthly fee? We've had consultations with Moxie, Patient Care, and even a law firm and they've implied that there's no legal issue with this setup. It just feels like a grey area, especially since we would not only be taking care of the non-clinical aspects of the Medspa, but she would also be doing the injections.

## Understanding Laser Hair Removal: How it Works

Before diving into specific clinics and prices, it’s essential to understand the science behind laser hair removal. The procedure uses concentrated beams of light to target hair follicles.The pigment in the hair follicle absorbs the light, which is then converted into heat. This heat damages the follicle, inhibiting future hair growth.

Several factors influence the effectiveness of laser hair removal, including skin tone, hair color, and the type of laser used.  Individuals with darker hair and lighter skin generally experience the best results. However, advancements in laser technology have made it possible to treat a wider range of skin types and hair colors effectively.

It's crucial to note that ""permanent hair removal"" is often a misnomer. Laser hair removal typically results in long-term hair reduction, meaning that while the hair may not completely disappear, it will become significantly thinner and lighter, and grow much more slowly.  Maintenance treatments may be required periodically to maintain optimal results. Don't confuse laser hair removal with electrolysis -- which is actually the only FDA-approved permanent hair removal method.

## Understanding Laser Hair Removal: How it effectively works

Before diving into the best laser hair removal orlando has to offer, it's crucial to understand how the process works. Laser hair removal uses concentrated beams of light to target the pigment (melanin) in hair follicles. The light energy is converted into heat, damaging the follicle and inhibiting future hair growth.

It's important to note that laser hair removal works best on dark hair and light skin. The contrast between the hair and skin allows the laser to effectively target the follicle without damaging the surrounding skin. However,advancements in laser technology have made it possible to treat a wider range of skin tones and hair colors. During your consultation, a skilled technician will assess your skin and hair type to determine the most appropriate laser technology and treatment plan for you.

Results aren't immediate. Multiple sessions are required to achieve optimal hair reduction, typically spaced several weeks apart. This is because hair grows in cycles, and laser hair removal is most effective during the active growth phase. Each session targets hair follicles in this phase, gradually reducing the overall amount of hair growth.

## Preparing for Your Laser Hair Removal Treatment

Proper readiness is crucial for maximizing results and minimizing the risk of side effects. Here are some critically important steps to take before your laser hair removal appointment:

*   **Avoid Sun Exposure:** Stay out of the sun for at least two weeks before your treatment. Sun exposure can increase the risk of skin discoloration and burns.
*   **Shave the Treatment Area:** Shave the treatment area 24-48 hours before your appointment. This allows the laser to target the hair follicles without burning the hair on the surface of the skin. Do not wax or pluck the hair, as these methods remove the hair follicle, wich is necessary for the laser to target.
*   **Avoid Certain Products:** Avoid using lotions, creams, makeup, or deodorant on the treatment area on the day of your appointment.*   **inform Your Technician:** inform your technician about any medications you are taking or any medical conditions you have. Some medications can increase your skin's sensitivity to light.

1jko4gj,JoinMochiHealth,Another update on Mochi,"So I wanted to give an update on my order from March 7. So Mochi sent me a tracking number last week and it said it was delivered yesterday. I didn’t receive it yesterday so waited to see if it would come today. It did not come today so I tried to contact Mochi where I was hung up on. I called both Empower pharmacy and USPS and they both said that the medication had not even been shipped yet. USPS was able to send me an email stating that so I can use it as proof for a refund. I will be trying to use a medspa instead since Mochi still won’t send my prescription. I had also emailed Mochi stating the issue and they responded and said they won’t be giving anyone refunds and that I should not email them about it again. That will work well as proof for my bank chargeback. I will also be calling my lawyer tomorrow to move forward on a lawsuit, he emailed me and said the email I got from Mochi is great proof as well. 

Update again: on the phone with them and empower at the same time right now. Empower said they could just merge the call and get the missing information from Mochi right now and the lady at Mochi said “I’m afraid that won’t be possible” I asked why and she said that it’s not possible to merge calls even though both me and the Empower agent offered to do it for her. After I asked again she refused and said she can email Empower instead. I asked if I can have a screenshot proof of that email or be CC’d on that and she said no because she doesn’t know how to do that. It is illegal for her to withhold my healthcare information from me and a violation of HIPPA. It seems like Mochi is purposely hiding this information from us. I am honestly disgusted by the actions of both the company and the customer service employees. ",2025-03-26 22:06:16+00:00,22,88

1jklli1,30PlusSkinCare,Spider veins under eyes after Botox,"Hey everyone, I got some Botox done for crow feet two days ago and I noticed that I got some spider veins under one of my eyes today 🥹. Is this permanent? Any ideas how to fix that? Never had that happen before ",2025-03-26 20:19:48+00:00,1,0
1jkl6n3,CompoundedSemaglutide,Scared,"I don't know what I'm looking for here exactly... But here it goes. I am on day 13 of my journey. I have lost about 7 lbs. I do not have much to lose SW:175, CW: 168, GW:140-145. I know that it's not popular to use at my SW, but I have gained a significant amount of weight in the last year with every test ran by my PCP coming back ""normal"". I eat well, I move a lot. I don't want my weight to creep up anymore as I don't feel comfortable and running (I've always been a runner) hurts my body. So I turned to a medspa and got compounded semaglutide. 

 I have not had any crazy or super intense side effects. A headache twice and slight nausea that comes and goes, but all manageable. I also had one incident where I felt really ""out of it"" but after exploring low blood sugar symptoms, I am thinkingnthatbthis is what I experienced. I am supposed to double the amount I take in a shot this Friday and I am terrified. Mostly of the side effects that could be immediate, but also of the things I've read about compounded semaglutide in general: how it's not FDA approved, how apparently 10 people have died from it, etc. I hate that I'm asking a bunch of internet strangers for advice and support, but where I am. Have any of you had so much anxiety over taking the meds that you just stop taking it? I'm debating what to do...",2025-03-26 20:03:04+00:00,1,15
1jkjkoy,glp1jerk,PLEASE REDDIT break me out of this stall,"Like many of you, I started with Zepbound and saw immediate appetite suppression. But I plateaued at 15 mg before reaching GW (so close yet so far, story of my life grrrrrrr). I got advice to gradually titrate semaglutide alongside the Zepbound. But since I was already at 15 on tirz, I started with 2.4 sema. This was rough with the sides, but it was worth it because I progressed... but only temporarily because I guess I'm a slow responder. Several people here suggested retatrutide, which is new? But I love the science behind it, so I added in 4 milligrams and then 8, and wow, yes, amazing belly fat reduction. Unfortunately, the tirz/sema/reta stack caused increased RHR as well as migraines and a new facial tic, which seem to be settling after adding daily Lipo-C.

While all this is going on, two evenings ago on the way home from the medspa, I fell off a sidewalk, rolling both ankles, badly bruising a wrist, and somehow scraping the hell out of my right ear. To deal with all that, I've worked in AOD-9604, BPC-157, TB-4, Ipamorelin, and Sermorelin, which I've read work synergistically to accelerate healing. Good thing, too, because it's getting pretty annoying typing all this with just one hand and blurry/striped vision.

I have a lot of faith in these peptides to help me reach my goals, but I admit I'm getting a little impatient. I filled my first Zepbound prescription last Wednesday. It's already been a week on this peptide journey, and that's including the 18 hours when I seem to have blacked out and woke up at the bottom of my stairs. How time flies!

Help me break out of my tirz/sema/reta stall! Anyone tried stacking UBT251? What's this Dexatrim I've been hearing about? My medspa is so funny, yesterday they joked I'm such a great customer that they're going to need a restraining order against me, but actually I'm literally standing outside their entrance right now. As soon as they open in 90 minutes, I'll pass on your suggestions. Thanks (but please hurry)!",2025-03-26 18:57:22+00:00,43,23

We're definitely planning to shut down Account A due to the damage and low engagement. My question is:

1jjogxm,30PlusSkinCare,"Thinking about biostimulators (Profhilo, Sculptra etc.)","Hi!

I’m 35 and starting to notice some changes in my skin—mainly loss of firmness, especially around my jawline and cheeks. It’s not terrible yet, but I can tell things are heading that way, and I want to stay ahead of it.

I’ve been looking into non-invasive treatments and came across biostimulators like Profhilo, Sculptra, and Sunekos. The idea of boosting my skin’s own collagen sounds way more appealing than fillers or Botox, but I don’t know anyone personally who’s done it.

If you’ve tried any of these treatments:  
– What made you choose them?  
– How was the actual procedure and aftercare?  
– Did you see real improvements?  
– Would you do it again, or try something else instead?

I’m also wondering how you chose your practitioner—was it based on reviews, a recommendation, or something else?

I’m not looking for a miracle, just something that helps me look fresher and age a little more gracefully.

1jix9bh,weddingplanning,4 month skincare routine - my experience so far + looking for advice!,"My wedding is at the end of July; I am so excited! I went to a MedSpa this weekend to start my skincare prep. I booked a HydraFacial and I am so happy with the results. My service was Saturday morning; today is Monday and my skin is just glowing. I'm attaching a before/after. My skin is visibly brighter, tighter and happier! 

I am in a fortunate position to be able to commit to one service/month leading up to my big day. I am already planning to do another HydraFacial the week before my wedding. We also discussed incorporating microneedling into my pamper plan to address some of my personal insecurities (pore size and some fine lines). I'm wondering if I should plan to microneedle in April/May/June or if I should plan to just do 1 or 2 microneedling sessions and stick to HydraFacials for maintenance. Any ideas? I'm hesitant to ask the MedSpa for guidance because I'm always worried they'll just push for the pricier treatment haha. 

ALSO - friendly reminder that any pampering before your wedding day should be for YOU and ONLY YOU! You deserve to feel your best, and if that means investing in some skincare in the months leading up to it, cool! If that means sticking to your usual routine and embracing the skin you're in, also cool! We are all beautiful! ",2025-03-24 18:02:37+00:00,1,0
1jix2sa,30PlusSkinCare,PRF under eyes would it work for sunkenness under the eye and tear troughs?,"So I initially planned to get this done today by a PA at a MedSpa in northern VA. The cost would be $750 for the first session and a free consultation. For some reason I'm having a very hard time finding someone who does this in this area and I checked out two other plastic surgeons one is an oculoplastic surgeon and they offer it for $1,250 for the first session with a separate fee for the consultation of $200. Another regular plastic surgery offers it for $1,450 for the first session and consultation of 150. This prices seem crazy for something that might not even take for work for the under eye. But my under eye area has been an issue for a while and I don't really want to resort to fillers that might migrate around my face. I never had surgery before and I am a little hesitant to try this but because it is natural I am more willing to try it. The PA has a lot of in injectables experience so I am a little confident but not totally I'm not even sure if it would work for me. I have had under eye sunkenness since I was 23 after crying a bunch and after a bad facial that inflamed my skin. So I have had this issue for a long time and I have been waiting until advancements have been made and I waited until natural fillers were available because I didn't want to use the fillers available at that time. Suggestions please? I also have an interest in micro needling as a way to reduce sunkenness around my tear troughs but I am a bit iffy about this. To be transparent I mean the under eye skin and the skin between the nose and the inner eye.",2025-03-24 17:55:47+00:00,2,0

I am mid thirties now and decided to do it again. There is an influencer from my area who goes to a nurse to have her Botox done and she came highly recommended. Apparently she is ‘award winning’ and seemed very competent.
Anyway, had the procedure done and oh wow, it hurt more than I remembered, I bruised in 3 spots. I felt dizzy immediately afterwards and had the WORST headache for 5 days, I even had to pull over on my way home because my head was hurting and I felt spacey. I had a panic attack on the 4th day because I was in so much pain and was worried the headache wouldn’t go away.
It did but now I have dropping in my left eyelid which looks terrible. 😞 
So now I’m not sure if the injector was at fault or if it’s just my anatomy and it would have happened regardless of where I went. Anyone had a similar issue? I’m reluctant to go back to her but also worried about going somewhere even worse.

With the photos, my main thing is the crater line between my eyebrows. Obviously pronounce when I scrunch my forehead, but you can see a visible indented line even when my face is relaxed. The lowest forehead line (right above eye brows) is becoming more noticeable in general as well.

And if you didn't notice, one of my labial folds is worse than the other. That one honestly doesn't bug me so much. 

I use a lot of facial massages to help, but I can't lie, seeing all my friends doing it, and seeing younger women doing it...makes me nervous. I wish I had complete confidence in this situation, but I. In therapy and it hasn't been worked through yet 😅",2025-03-24 00:20:56+00:00,1,0

Long story not so short, 34, male, lost 100lbs in my late teens (4 months, very unhealthy, could this be the culprit) and by the age of 27 I started getting botox for forehead wrinkles as I was too expressive.

Followed a very consistent routine for ages consisting of tretinoin 0,05% (double cleans, often AHA peels, Niacinamide serum, Korean skincare etc.).

Then in 2021 I lost my father, followed by heavy depression and some abnormal changes in my face. I lost facial fat, while my body remained the same (fat wise).

I got my first cheek filler (Radiesse 3ml in total). The followed some Mesotherapy and overall filler here and there.

In 2023 I got a lower blepharoplasty, the surgeon is very noted here and he performed also a face lift on my mom.

Fast forward till today, I continue getting filler for the midface (Restylane, I’m in Europe and Juvederm is not widely available) and recently I noticed a huge dent in the middle of the cheeks that is basically following the tear through down to the middle cheek. Making the nasolabilal folds even more prominent.

I spent thousands of dollars in order to look refreshed and keep face sculpted and now I can’t even look myself in the mirror.

I felt like sharing if someone is facing the same outcomes, whether anyone found a ‘solution’ or a direction.

Sorry about the very long text :) if anyone has any questions, do not hesitate to ask.

1ji756t,30PlusSkinCare,Facial balancing photos & skin tint spf question,"I posted a side profile before & after a week ago about getting filler & Botox done with my emphasis being on facial balancing related to my chin/jawline. A few people asked about photos from the front, so here are 2 before & afters. 
The Botox really did help with my eyelid ptosis & give a more refreshed look in my opinion. I only 1.5 syringes of chin filler but I think it did make a nice improvement so far. The rest of the filler (3 syringes total) was in my midface / cheeks & less than half a syringe in just the upper lip to restore some volume. 
These photos are no makeup, besides fake lashes & in the second before, I had just gotten my brows tinted and cleaned up. Note that in the second after, some of my bruises are still visible & a little swelling was still present. I tried to give the most similar angles/expressions but I never took straight on photos without smiling a bit to try to lift my cheeks before because I hated how much my lower cheeks drooped. My injector thinks we have 1 or 2 more sessions to go to reach my goals, but I am very happy with this outcome so far. 


Now, onto skin tint question: I really want to find a skin tint that doubles as either a moisturizer or a spf. Medium coverage. Foundation has just been sitting too heavy and no matter what I do, it looks cakey / flakey. As you can see, I am very pale and my skin is dry/sensitive (the dryest of dry) and has pink/red undertones. Please share what has and what not worked for you.

I’m 38 and trying to improve my very minimal skin routine. My skin has taken a beating with all the IVF hormones over the last couple of years. And of course, there is aging. My goals are to reduce dryness + under eye black circles + dullness + forehead wrinkles. 

A bit more context - I usually only use bioderma micellar water to remove make up (probably once a week). When I don’t wear makeup (most of the time) then I just use water to wash my face. I use a moisturizer twice a day. Avene sunscreen afterwords. Over the past 2 weeks I have added:  
-Soy Hydrating Gentle Face Cleanser twice a day (I find it a bit drying and too scented) 
-Laneige Water Sleeping Mask with Niacinamide & Squalane at night 
-I switched my moisturizer from Avene revitalizing nourishing cream to Laneige water bank blue hyaluronic, which I use in the morning only. 
-added Cerave eye repair cream 

I’m allergic to benzoyl peroxide (my face swells up and I get an itchy warm rash all over my face). I should also say that I do Botox for migraines and was considering to expand to my entire forehead. I also have Retin-A micro 0.04% (tretinoin) which I haven’t use consistently for years because of IVF (have to stop during transfers), and I’m scared to restart it because my skin is already dry and sensitive.

Please recommend must have products/new habits to implement. I’d like to keep my routine as simple as possible. Of course I’d patch test and introduce one new product at a time.

The “License-to-Hire” Setup That Could Trigger Fines, Audits, or License Loss","If you’re running (or planning to run) a MedSpa in California and you’re not a licensed physician, you’ve probably heard about the MSO-PC model — the go-to structure to keep things legal.

You might think you’re in the clear legally — but there’s a growing number of MedSpas using a structure that **looks compliant on paper** but in practice could be **a ticking time bomb**. It’s called a **“license-to-hire” arrangement**, and if you’re not careful, it could get your business shut down.

Here’s a case study based on a real (but anonymized) agreement we reviewed.

**💡 The Setup**

In California, non-doctors (aka “laypersons”) can’t legally own or control a medical practice — including a MedSpa that offers treatments like Botox, lasers, IV therapy, etc. So instead, the common workaround is to use the **MSO-PC model**:

* The **PC (Professional Corporation)** is owned by a licensed doctor. It provides medical services and employs the clinical staff.
* The **MSO (Management Services Organization)** is owned by the entrepreneur or investor. It provides the space, equipment, admin staff, marketing, tech, and everything non-medical.

Done correctly, it’s legal. The doctor owns the medical practice, and the MSO supports it — charging a fair management fee. But what we’re seeing more often is that these setups are **structured in a way that gives full control to the MSO**, and the doctor is just a name on paper — **effectively “hired” to lend their license.** That’s where the danger lies.

**🚨 What This Looks Like in Practice**

In this example, the MedSpa agreement *looked* like a standard MSO-PC setup. But the details revealed that the MSO had **full financial and operational control** — here’s how:

**🚩 7 Red Flags That Point to a “License-to-Hire” Arrangement**

**1. The MSO collects all patient revenue, deposits it into a bank account it controls, and manages the money.** Although the PC is technically the medical practice, **the MSO handles all payments from patients, insurers, etc.** and deposits them into a business bank account.

**The twist? The MSO has full signatory control over that account.** The doctor can’t move funds, pay staff, or access revenue directly. This gives the MSO **complete financial control** of the medical practice — which is a massive red flag under California law.

**2. The MSO pays itself first, then sends whatever is left to the PC.** Instead of the PC paying a fixed monthly fee for management services, the MSO **takes what it wants first** — rent, equipment use, marketing, admin staff, etc. Only after the MSO is paid does the doctor get any remaining funds. In some cases, the MSO can even raise its own fees at will.

**3. The MSO owns all the critical assets — lasers, office, brand, domain, social media, even the patient phone number.** If the doctor leaves or the agreement ends, they walk away with nothing. The MSO owns the identity of the MedSpa. The PC is disposable.

**4. The MSO can terminate the doctor with just 24 hours’ notice.** Yes — one-day notice. This means the doctor has no real security or stake in the practice. If they’re gone, the MSO just finds a new one and keeps going.

**5. The MSO can migrate all patient records to a new physician of its choosing.** This clause effectively says: if the current doctor leaves, the MSO can assign a new doctor to take over — with access to patient records, staff, and space.

This is **the clearest sign of a license-to-hire** model: the MSO runs the show and just swaps out the licensed provider when needed.

**6. The MSO handles all staffing, HR, payroll, and scheduling.** The PC supposedly employs the nurses and providers — but in practice, the MSO recruits, trains, manages, and even fires them. That’s illegal in California if the MSO is managing *clinical staff* without physician oversight.

**7. The doctor has no say in the business and no real ownership interest.** They don’t control the money, don’t own the brand, don’t hire the staff, and can be removed at any time. That’s not ownership — that’s employment.

Even if the PC is technically in the doctor’s name, the MSO is the one operating the MedSpa.

**🧠 Why This Is a Problem**

Under California law, this kind of setup is considered **illegal lay control of a medical practice**. If the Medical Board, Attorney General, or insurance payers dig into it — and see that the MSO is calling the shots — they could:

* Shut down the business
* Sanction or revoke the doctor’s license
* Issue massive fines
* Investigate for fraud or illegal fee-splitting

Even worse, **any malpractice insurer, landlord, or potential buyer could back out** once they realize the business was structured illegally.

**✅ What a Compliant MedSpa Should Do**

If you’re operating a MedSpa under the MSO-PC model, make sure:

* The physician has **true control** over medical decisions, clinical staff, protocols, and patient care.
* The MSO charges **fair market value** for real services — not a disguised profit share.
* The bank account is **owned and controlled by the PC**, not the MSO.
* The doctor can’t be terminated without serious cause and proper notice.
* The PC is not easily replaced or overridden by the MSO.

A lot of MedSpas in California are unintentionally running illegal “license-to-hire” operations — where the MSO runs everything and the doctor is just along for the ride. That’s not compliant, and it can blow up your entire business. **Structure it right, or risk losing everything.**

**Disclaimer:** This is not legal advice. We are not attorneys, and none of this should be taken as legal guidance. It’s a general analysis based on our own experience working with healthcare lawyers. Always speak to a qualified attorney before making any business decisions involving a MedSpa.",2025-03-22 19:44:57+00:00,6,1

I wanted a second opinion. OK, maybe a third opinion! Tie breaker between those two awful doctors. I call the medspa behind the 7-11 and SPOILER ALERT they tell me (I wrote it down exactly) ""0.25 milligrams injected subcutaneously once weekly for 4 weeks."" The plot thickens.

To the web! Mayo Clinic says **0.25 milligrams (mg) injected under the skin once a week for 4 weeks.** And I didn't even know Ozempic had it's own websight, where they say **The beginning dose is 0.25 mg once a week for the first 4 weeks.** Novo Nordisk Australia says ""When you first start using Ozempic®, the starting dose is 0.25 mg once a week for four weeks"" but of course they use metric there so I assume we need to convert that to euros.

I've definitely done my own research!

Redditors, help me! What should my starting dose be? About me: I'm Episcopalian, and I adopted a service animal for my chronic Epstein-Barr. I heard long-distance runners develop a natural tolerance to GLP-1s. I'm not a runner but I thought that might apply because I'm planning to get into jogging or speed walking. What do you all think is the right dose for me?

1jgu2ww,MedSpa,How a Non-Doctor Can Open a Med Spa in California (Legally),"Hey everyone,

If you’re a non-doctor (a “layperson”) and you’re thinking about opening a **medical spa in California**, you’ve probably heard about the **MSO-PC model**. I wanted to share a simple breakdown of how it works and why it’s important.

**🧠 The Problem: Corporate Practice of Medicine (CPOM)**

California has strict laws that **only licensed physicians** can own a medical practice. That means:

• You can’t open a med spa and hire a doctor to do Botox.

• You can’t split profits with a doctor from medical services.

• You can’t control how medicine is practiced — only doctors can.

So how do you, a business-minded person, get involved in a med spa **legally**?

**💡 The Solution: MSO-PC Model**

You create **two separate legal entities**:

1. **PC (Professional Corporation)**

• Owned 100% by a licensed doctor.

• This entity bills for and provides all **medical services**.

• Only the doctor makes clinical decisions.

2. **MSO (Management Services Organization)**

• Owned by you (the layperson).

• Provides **non-medical services**: space, staff, equipment, marketing, scheduling, technology, admin, etc.

• You charge the PC a **management fee** for these services.

The PC focuses on patient care. The MSO runs the business side.

**💰 How Do You Make Money?**

You **don’t own the medical practice**, but your MSO charges the PC for all the infrastructure it provides.

For example:

• You rent the office to the PC.

• You lease them the laser machines.

• You license them your website, brand, and software.

• You provide billing, HR, and marketing services.

The PC pays you a **management fee**, ideally structured to reflect the **fair market value** of those services.

That fee = **your profit**.

You don’t “split profits” in the literal sense — that’s illegal. But if you structure the MSO fee right, you can build a business that effectively earns **50% or more of the med spa’s net revenue**, legally.

**🛑 What You CAN’T Do**

• You can’t make medical decisions.

• You can’t tell the doctor how to treat patients.

• You can’t employ nurses or injectors directly unless you’re a licensed medical provider.

• You can’t replace the doctor without a compliant agreement that respects CPOM laws.

**✅ Pro Tips**

• Work with a lawyer who knows **healthcare compliance and CPOM**. This stuff is very state-specific and getting it wrong can ruin your business.

• Use clear contracts: a **Management Services Agreement**, equipment leases, IP licenses, etc.

• Don’t try to “own” the doctor. Let them practice medicine freely — and focus on building a great brand, team, and experience.

Hope that helps someone out there thinking about starting a med spa in CA. It’s totally doable — just gotta do it right. If anyone’s done it and wants to share lessons or mistakes, I’m all ears.

1jgrdq3,30PlusSkinCare,First Time with Neurotoxin and not liking it - are these side effects normal?,"Any advice, feedback, input would be much appreciated!  I am freaking out a little bit. 

I got Jeuveau (similar to Botox) 9 days ago in my forehead area and I really don't like it so far. It was my first time getting any injections so would love some input. 

My forehead has some bumpy looking portions, maybe where the product didn't ""take""?  It looks kind of weird.  Also my eyebrows feel heavy and are kind of drooping and my eyelids are a little puffy I guess?  I have read that this might be from too much used, it is in essence weighing that area down.

The place I went to is a reputable spa/salon in a high end neighborhood, but I feel like maybe the injector could have taken more care.  They didn't ask me any medical questions (i.e. prescriptions I was on), didn't give me any side effect information (like these things that are happening), and I didn't even know a follow-up/top off appointment was a thing until I started doing some googling.  There isn't anything like that scheduled. 

At this point, I am not sure I would even want to go back to the person because I worry that anything they do to improve it might make it worse.  They gave me 32 units (I think they actually never really told me the total #).  They were telling me how they had 50 or something like that in their forehead. I told them I wanted to be very subtle this first time.  I was told my muscles in my forehead are kind of pronounced (I have noticed this actually myself).

1jgpuz4,LaserHairRemoval,NO Refunds????,"Hi! I went to a place that have 5 star reviews after a bad experience w/ LaserAway. LaserAway was telling me I never needed to come in for an in person consult, that they took people with all hair types and skin tone... Needless to say I declined their services.  
The place I wanted to go with after shopping around and talking with many different locations seemed pretty legit. They have a MedSpa (I really don't know what that is lol), but basically several dermatologists onsite and also you can get voluntary services like laser.

I went in, had a pretty good consult. The prices were high. $900 for 10 sessions on a small area (you can pick several areas to do. So 2 areas would mean only 5 sessions each).  
$2500 for 10 sessions on medium area (same thing, you can split, but fixed cost. No other bundles).  
They also use a CUTERA® XEO laser, which initially I thought **Nd:YAG** was a fair choice. I guess the machine also does IPL at the same time or has a setting for IPL? 

So I put $3400 down and planned on doing 4 areas. 2 small, 2 medium. 5 each. They scheduled me and all was well. I did some more research once I got home to double check everything... Seems like people need a lot of sessions with that machine :(

So I called up and I was voicing my concerns and they were like ""no this is the BEST machine. No we explained you may need touch ups.. well you understood that before"" 

I called to voice I was getting nervous from what I read online about the machine and that this could possibly be a serious waste of money since 5 sessions could mean a significant amount of regrowth in the future, and the response was a tad defensive.

She instead was just kind of repeating what she said in the consult, totally fair, she gave a lot of useful info.

Then she said ......... ""Well we do not offer refunds""





WHAT??? She called back after discussing with her bosses and offered me a bunch of free sessions, but I am still rather uncomfortable with this.





I made sure to say several times ""I had no idea that you didn't take refunds."" and she just kept saying ""we can do different treatments instead of laser""... That isn't the point, yanno?

I have no choice but to do the laser. Now 6 sessions on 4 areas instead of 5 sessions. I am still not the happiest. I guess $3400 for 24 sessions isn't terrible and it will be fine... 

I just HATED that they didn't mention it??? Anyone ever have this happen? I've never even been to a session. I have used 0 of them... they just didn't wanna lose out on a sale, which I get, but this was pretty disappointing and I am kicking myself.",2025-03-21 19:53:43+00:00,0,10

I’m growing increasingly unhappy with the way my forehead looks and I feel like I’ve aged 5-7 years in the past year. It doesn’t help that I have a “5 head” either 😅

I had my son in 2023 and since then have had the typical transition of less sleep and self care (facials, products, etc). I try to stay on top of hydrating but with a 50 hour work week, 2 hour daily commute, and toddler to care for - I often fail to drink enough if I’m being honest.

I use Philosophy’s Purity facial cleanser, Garnier Micellar water to remove makeup at night, witch hazel as a toner, and then finish with neutrogena hydro boost water gel as a moisturizer. I also wear daily SPF on face and neck via my ITCosmetics CC Cream foundation. I’ll be honest that I do not think I have the commitment/funds to do some of the 6-7 step face routines I see recommended on here sometimes.

Looking for cost friendly products that might help my forehead look better. Also open to thoughts on whether Botox or other treatments might help as I’m willing to save and splurge on something like that later this year if possible ",2025-03-20 16:02:39+00:00,6,34

Did my interview online and within 30 minutes I find myself coming in tomorrow to do a shadow/ training day to see if I like the job/ workplace. Theyre paying me so thats great. This is my first job in aesthetics out of bedside nursing so idk what to expect. Pay is a little low ($35, compared ot major chains like LaserAway) but I suppose the commission/ tips make up for it.

I'm a spa owner. We recently received a Vectus laser for hair removal - it's almost brand new, and I need some insight because something feels off.

* The **large handpiece** is **almost unbearable**—the pain is extreme.
* The **small handpiece** is okay in some areas (like hands), but for most of the body - especially underarms - it’s still **very painful**.

The **cooling system is working**, and the handpiece itself gets cold, so I don’t think it’s a cooling failure. But I’m wondering… is this normal for Vectus, or is there something we’re missing?

Would love to hear from anyone who’s worked with this system - **is there a way to make treatments more tolerable?** Any settings adjustments, techniques, or tips?

1jf1aup,30PlusSkinCare,Am I the only one with zero interest in Botox?,"I’m new to this sub and this post isn’t about shaming anyone - you do you, boo! We all deserve to look and feel our best and it’s okay if that looks different for everyone. 

But I’m here because I want to look nice and take care of my skin (especially since I have years of acne scarring) but I have no desire to fix natural lines in my face. Growing old is a privilege denied to many, and I’ve always found crows feet, laugh lines, etc beautiful because, to me, it’s a sign of a life well lived. It seems that Botox is the norm though instead of the exception.

Edit: It’s several hours later and despite trying to take ownership in my comments I’m still getting replies calling me passive aggressive, smug, self-congratulatory etc etc so I’m adding this at the top (without deleting the original and seeming disingenuous). 

I understand that I phrased this post poorly and I get why people don’t want to give me the benefit of the doubt. I joined this sub because I’ve never had “good” skin and am trying to learn how to take better care of it going forward (since a lot of the things I did as a teenager probably just exacerbated my acne etc). I tried to research specific products, look at the my routine posts, etc and it seemed like the vast majority of them included Botox recommendations. Whenever posts from this sub popped up on my home feed they were Botox related. I was discouraged by this because it’s not something I’m interested in, but I really didn’t mean to suggest that using Botox is some kind of moral failing. I’m new to this sub and I didn’t know posts like this came up a lot and I recognize that I should have searched the sub more thoroughly before posting. 

As for my comment about finding laugh lines, etc beautiful I wasn’t trying to be smug. I wasn’t actually even thinking about myself I was thinking about the women I love and the times they looked the most beautiful to me. They were the moments we were belly laughing together or they were cheesing it up for the camera and living well. As many comments have pointed out though, getting Botox and aging with joy aren’t mutually exclusive and I’m sorry that I romanticized it and came across as judgmental. 

Just like I’m insecure about my acne scars, dark pigment spots, uneven skin tone etc etc there are people who are insecure about visible lines of aging and I get why people thought I was being judgmental and dismissive about it even though that wasn’t my intention. I didn’t mean to discount other people’s insecurities. I want everyone to feel confident and happy as they age and I really don’t judge the methods of how you achieve that.

1jez07k,Marin,Where is the injector Andrea from SkinSpirit?,"I used to go to the BEST injector in the SF Bay Area at SkinSpirit in Larkspur / Marin but one day she left and when I ask them where she went they will not tell me and offered me a discount to go to the other providers.

1jex0ay,u_badiyabrand,Anti-Wrinkle Injection vs. Botox: What’s the Difference?,"https://preview.redd.it/064t4i82fnpe1.jpg?width=1380&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ed79091f40bc3b4cf9a69395937818399463e68

# Introduction

In the world of non-surgical cosmetic treatments, anti-wrinkle injections and Botox are often used interchangeably. However, while Botox is a type of anti-wrinkle injection, not all anti-wrinkle injections are Botox. Understanding their differences, benefits, and how they work can help you make an informed decision about the best treatment for your skin.

# What Are Anti-Wrinkle Injections?

Anti-wrinkle injections are cosmetic treatments designed to reduce fine lines and wrinkles by relaxing facial muscles. These injections use neurotoxins like botulinum toxin to temporarily block nerve signals, preventing muscle contractions that cause wrinkles.

# What Is Botox?

Botox is a brand name for botulinum toxin type A, which is widely used for anti-wrinkle treatments. It is one of the most recognized and FDA-approved injectables used for reducing facial wrinkles, fine lines, and even certain medical conditions like migraines and excessive sweating.

# Key Differences Between Anti-Wrinkle Injections and Botox

# Advantages of Anti-Wrinkle Injections

1. Multiple Options Available — Patients can choose from Botox, Dysport, Xeomin, and Jeuveau based on their needs.
2. Longer-Lasting Effects — Some alternatives like Dysport may offer slightly longer results compared to Botox.
3. More Affordable Choices — Other botulinum toxin brands may cost less than Botox while providing similar results.
4. Customizable Treatment — Different brands diffuse differently, making them suitable for specific areas of the face.

# Advantages of Botox

1. Proven Track Record — Botox has been extensively researched and FDA-approved for both cosmetic and medical uses.
2. Highly Precise Treatment — It does not spread as much as some alternatives, allowing for more controlled and localized effects.
3. Fast-Acting — Results are typically noticeable within 3–5 days, making it a popular choice.
4. Reliable and Trusted Brand — Botox is one of the most well-known cosmetic treatments worldwide, giving patients confidence in its efficacy.

# Which One Should You Choose?

The choice between Botox and other anti-wrinkle injections depends on several factors:

* Desired Results — If you need precise treatment for small areas, Botox might be the best choice. If you need broader diffusion, other brands may be preferable.
* Budget — Botox is often more expensive than other botulinum toxin brands.
* Previous Experience — If you have used one brand before and liked the results, you may want to stick with it.
* Doctor’s Recommendation — A qualified practitioner can suggest the best option based on your skin type and concerns.

# Conclusion

Both Botox and anti-wrinkle injections are effective treatments for reducing fine lines and wrinkles. While Botox is a well-known brand, other anti-wrinkle injections provide similar benefits with slight differences in diffusion, onset time, and cost. Consulting with a professional will help determine the best choice for your aesthetic goals and budget. Regardless of which treatment you choose, these injections remain one of the safest and most effective ways to maintain a youthful appearance without surgery.

1jet7nl,tirzepatidecompound,Order yet today?!? Advice/Help!,"In Florida, been on tirze since June. I have about 35 more pounds to lose - I’m hoping to be there by end of July. 

Up to 10mg dose. I have had so much success and have been with Mochi for 6ish of those months. I wasn’t worried. But now with the pharmacy issues, news, etc. I am now concerned. 

I have about six weeks left on hand. I can pick up another four weeks from my local MedSpa this week (where I started). 

But where else/what else could I still order today that will arrive quickly, be easily accessible, ideally at the highest dose I can get to make last the longest, and have the longest shelf life.

1jesqxt,30PlusSkinCare,Can anybody help me refine my routine (with a focus on anti-ageing). I’m 31F with sensitive skin and based in the UK,"Hello! I have a nice little routine that I’m fairly happy with but would like to refine it a little.

I can be a bit lazy with my skincare so like to keep it simple, I have quite reactive skin (with slight rosacea when it does react), and I really want to go all in on the anti-ageing front - other than that I have really clear skin and people often compliment me on my skin, so no huge concerns. I have a line across my forehead and it’s really starting to get me down so I want to target that in particular - no frown lines or crows feet yet, fortunately. I’ve been considering Botox but ideally would prefer not to go that route.

Currently my routine is as follows:
Cleanse: not hugely picky with cleansers but usually opt for a sensitive cleanser from cerave/LRP
Serum: TO Hyaluronic Acid (I did originally invest in the Vichy Hyaluronic Acid which frustratingly caused an allergic reaction for some unknown reason)
Day Cream: Inkey List Peptide Cream
SPF: Beauty of Joseon SPF 50 or SKIN1004 SPF 50
Night Cream: Olay Regenerist 24 Unscented 
Exfoliator: Dermalogica Microfoliant (I do only remember to do this once a week or so though) 

At night I’ve been sleeping with one of those silicone patches on my forehead which helps very short term (I.e. for an hour or so), but it does make me more conscious of moving my forehead which is helpful. I drink around 2L of water a day, take a whole range of targeted supplements including collagen, Hyaluronic acid, cod liver oil and biotin, and eat a balanced and healthy diet.

I’m considering investing in some Tretinoin when I transit through Dubai next month (0.025 strength), but am worried my skin might not be quite up for that. Any suggestions on how I can tweak my routine to start seeing results? I love my day and night creams because they feel nice to apply and leave my skin feeling soft, but I’m not sure they’re doing the hard work on the anti-ageing side.

Looking for something mid-range as I’m sick of paying lots of money for products that I end up reacting to.

Thanks for reading! :)

1jdu827,30PlusSkinCare,Ive tried ULTHERAPY PRIME - lets talk about it,"**I Tried Ultherapy Prime—LETS DISCUSS**

**Background**: Ultherapy Prime is the latest version of Ultherapy, promising less pain and an overall quicker session. As someone with *zero* pain tolerance, I was SCARED. I’ve done Shurink (Korea’s version of Ultherapy) and Oligio (Korea’s version of Thermage), both marketed as ""pain-free""—LIES!!!!!! I saw my ancestors. My soul left my body and jumped into the multiverse. I hated it so much and it did nothing for me. I'm asian, slim and athletic build, female, late 30s, no wrinkles but some slight jowling. No fear of losing ""fat"" as I have plenty of volume. Located in the US.

**The Procedure:** I was topically numbed up, had Pronox on standby (didn’t need it), and while some spots got a little *spicy*, it was **totally OK!!** my focus was the jaw line. Most of the session was minimal pain except for some spots were briefly spicy. But honestly? It made me feel like something was ***working***! I felt **ALIVE.** I *almost* want to say it was enjoyable overall. I was able to keep a conversation throughout with the nurse, and that helped take my mind off things. FYI- if the clinic offers it, I would recommend getting a vitamin IV drip at the same time!

**Is it worth it?** Too soon to tell. I saw a slight lift immediately, but results take 2-3 months to fully show. Full disclosure: I got this session as a gift, but NO ONE is paying me to write this. I'm just a fan of all things beauty and want to pay it forward. I’ll report back when I can weigh the results against the (very hefty) price tag.  if youre for sure wanting ultherapy, pay the extra for PRIME. I'm going to korea in the summer and considering doing another session for my cheeks there since it's much cheaper than in the US.

For pain reference, here’s my pain ranking scale, where 10 = *an act of war on my face…*

1jde8fe,MedSpa,Thinking About Buying a Med Spa? Read This Before You Regret It.,"# Hey everyone—I’ve been seriously looking into buying a med spa, but the more I research, the more red flags I find. It turns out a lot of people buy into failing businesses without realizing it and end up losing way more than they expected.

I figured I’d drop some key things I’ve learned so far—because **there’s way more to this than just checking revenue numbers**.

# 🚨 Biggest Mistakes People Make When Buying a Med Spa

💸 **1. Not Checking the Legal Side First**

* Did you know **in most states, you can’t own a med spa unless you’re a physician?** (Yeah, I didn’t either at first.)
* There are ways around this, like **the MSO model**, but if you set it up wrong, you could lose everything.
* **Some sellers try to make shady “ghost ownership” deals**—which can literally get you fined or shut down.

💰 **2. Overpaying Because of Fake Profits**

* Some owners **run personal expenses** (cars, family salaries, vacations) through the business to make it look more profitable.
* If you’re not adjusting for these, **you might be buying a business that isn’t making nearly as much as it seems.**
* Always ask for **a breakdown of revenue per treatment** (Botox, lasers, facials, etc.)—it helps show what’s actually driving the business.

⚠️ **3. Not Checking Equipment & Licenses**

* **Old or non-compliant laser machines = $$$$ to replace.**
* Some med spas **aren’t even fully licensed**, and you’d be on the hook for fixing it (or getting shut down).
* Always **bring in a med spa consultant or lawyer** to check everything first.

**Here’s a full breakdown of the most important factors before buying a med spa:**

 **Buying a Med Spa? Don’t Do It Until You Know These Key Factors.**](https://dermaskinsolution.com/blogs/insights/buying-a-med-spa-dont-do-it-until-you-know-these-key-factors)



# 🏆 How to Actually Buy a Good Med Spa

🔍 **1. Do a Deep Dive on Financials**

* Gross profit margin should be **60-70%** (if it’s under 50%, *why?*).
* Look at **revenue per treatment hour**—$200-$500 is solid.
* **Client retention** should be **70%+**—if people aren’t coming back, that’s a bad sign.

👩‍⚕️ **2. Make Sure Key Staff Will Stay**

* Most clients are loyal to **their injector, not the business**—so if top providers leave, **so do the customers**.
* **Check employment agreements** to see if they’re locked in or can leave the second you take over.
* Consider **signing bonuses or retention incentives** to keep the best staff.

💼 **3. Negotiate Like a Boss**

* Ask for **a trial period** where the owner stays involved for a few months.
* Structure a **portion of the price as an “earn-out”**—meaning they only get the full amount if revenue stays strong after the sale.
* Get a **healthcare attorney** to review everything (*not just any business lawyer—they need to understand med spa laws*).

# 🔥 Final Thoughts

Buying a med spa **can be an amazing investment**—but **only if you do it right**. A lot of people get caught up in the hype, ignore the details, and end up regretting it.

If you’ve looked into buying one (or already own one), **what was your biggest challenge?** Would love to hear what’s worked and what’s been a total nightmare! 👇

I’ve struggled with my skin confidence for my whole life! My main concerns are the very enlarged pores on my cheeks and nose! With age, I’ve tried to forget them and embrace my face for what it is, as I know you can only do so much to reduce the visibility of them. However, as of late it looks lifeless and rough textured :( please help me! It’s getting me down!

Currently using Skin + Me in the evening:
Tretinoin (0.015%): a retinoid proven to make pores less visible
Niacinamide (4%): an antioxidant proven to reduce skin oil production
Azelaic Acid (4%): a natural acid that normalises skin cells to unblock pores
+ SPF in the AM

I work out 5 days per week, eat well and stay hydrated!

I’m at a stage of my life where I can invest in some skin care and procedures a couple of times a year to help. I just don’t know where to start for treatments that are actually effective!!  

Should I start Botox?
Is mesobotox worth it for texture?
Is there anything else I could do?

1jdbyb4,30PlusSkinCare,Feeling bad about my lower face. Help?,"I am realizing that my face is becoming more boxy on the bottom part near the jaw. Just to get an idea these pictures were taken three years apart (left three years ago and right recently).

I am very disciplined with my skin care since years and use retinol, peptides, vitamin c, a good moisturizer. I also use red light therapy and sunscreen daily. I also take oral collagen supplements since recently. I do facial massages every night.

I'm starting to feel very down about the way my lower face looks. I had some tension in my jaw during the last couple years so the muscles are a bit over developed in that area but what I'm noticing next to that is a lot of fat from my cheek seems to have gone down to the jaw area. However I don't want to do masseter Botox because I heard it can increase jowling especially if you have a lot of fat on top of the jawbone.

Does anyone have recs to counter this (Skincare or injectables). Also important to note that I have an auto immune disease susceptibility so not sure sculptra would be a good fit for me.

I got Botox for the first time 6 months ago but the doctor said that it won’t make the line go away it will just stop it from getting worse and that I should get the moxi laser and that should fade it. But then I’m reading some horror stories about people getting the moxi and having facial fat melted off so not sure it’s worth the risk. Also for others I’ve read that it didn’t do anything. 

Was also reading about people getting Botox a few times and their static lines looking much better so maybe if I get a top up will it relax the muscle even more? Anyone have any suggestions? Or is there any alternative other than lasers? ",2025-03-17 10:48:11+00:00,0,18

I definitely did not expect to be hit with dozens of horror stories of months-long anxiety supposedly caused by the treatment. Some Instagram pages and Facebook groups with tons of horrifying images and warnings. The tone of those accounts seemed a little manipulative and fear-mongering, but still.  
  
Honestly, I'm on the verge of cancelling because of this newly triggered anxiety. Aaaand I feel terribly disappointed because I was really looking forward to it and wish I hadn't googled anything at all.

1jcxotf,newjersey,Med Spa in NJ Scam?,"Med Spa shady booking policies

Question 

Is it fair to not allow your customers to reschedule or rebook 72 hours in advance or even cancel their appointment without getting penalized?  

There’s this one MedSpa where I made an appointment but I have changed my mind and I do not want to have this appointment in regardless they took a $200 deposit and then another $200 deposit and according to their policy, you are not allowed to cancel or reschedule without forfeiting everything that you paid, including the entire amount of the procedure so basically I am locked in in somehow getting the procedure or different procedure in which I’m paying and egregious amount of money. 

It seems really unfair and unreasonable to not allow your customers to cancel an appointment 72 hours in advance and get their deposit back instead they keep your deposit and they charge you for the entire procedure despite not even getting it. How is this legal? This business is a New Jersey 

Edit:

The more I think about it, this is straight up theft. 

I should note a reason I want to cancel is because the med spa has sanitation complaints and I realized this after the fact smh 🤦 ",2025-03-16 22:33:36+00:00,0,60

## understanding the Laser Hair Removal Process

Laser hair removal is a medical procedure that uses concentrated beams of light to target and destroy hair follicles. The laser emits light energy that is absorbed by the melanin (pigment) in the hair. This energy is converted into heat, which damages the hair follicle, inhibiting future hair growth.

The effectiveness of laser hair removal depends on several factors,including:

*   **Hair Color:** Laser hair removal works best on dark,coarse hair. The laser targets the melanin in the hair follicle, so dark hair absorbs more energy.Light-colored hair (blonde, gray, white) is more arduous to treat.
*   **Skin Tone:** the contrast between hair color and skin tone is crucial. Individuals with dark hair and light skin are typically the best candidates. Though, advancements in laser technology have made it possible to treat a wider range of skin tones safely and effectively.
*   **Laser Type:** Different types of lasers are designed for different skin types and hair colors. Choosing the right laser for your specific needs is essential for achieving optimal results and minimizing the risk of side effects. More on this below.
*   **Treatment Area:** Some areas of the body respond better to laser hair removal than others. Areas with thicker, darker hair, such as the bikini line and underarms, tend to show results more quickly.
*   **Number of Sessions:** Multiple sessions are required to achieve important hair reduction.This is because hair grows in cycles, and the laser is most effective on hair follicles that are in the active growth phase.

## What to Expect During Your Laser Hair Removal Treatment

Before your first laser hair removal treatment in Charlotte, NC, you'll typically have a consultation with a qualified technician.During this consultation, the technician will assess your skin type, hair color, and treatment goals. They will also explain the procedure, potential risks and side effects, and answer any questions you may have.

**Preparation:**

*   **Avoid Sun Exposure:** It’s critical to avoid sun exposure for several weeks before your treatment. Tanned skin can increase the risk of complications.
*   **Shave the Treatment Area:** Shave the area to be treated 12-24 hours before your appointment. This allows the laser to target the hair follicle directly without burning the hair on the surface of the skin. Do NOT wax or pluck, as this removes the hair follicle, which is what the laser targets.
*  **Avoid Certain Medications**: Discuss any medications or supplements you are taking with your technician beforehand, as some can increase sensitivity to light.

**During the Procedure:**

*   You will be provided with protective eyewear to shield your eyes from the laser light.
*   The technician will use a handheld laser device to deliver pulses of light to the treatment area.
*   You may feel a snapping or stinging sensation as the laser targets the hair follicles. This is usually described as mild discomfort.
*   The technician may use a cooling device or gel to help minimize discomfort and protect your skin.
*   The duration of the treatment will depend on the size of the area being treated. Small areas like the upper lip may take only a few minutes, while larger areas like the legs or back may take up to an hour.

**After the Procedure:**

*   Your skin may be slightly red or swollen immediately after the treatment. This is normal and usually subsides within a few hours.
*   You can apply a cool compress to the treated area to help reduce any discomfort.
*   Avoid sun exposure and wear sunscreen with a high SPF for several weeks after the treatment.
*   Avoid hot showers, saunas, and strenuous exercise for 24-48 hours after the treatment.
*   You may experience some shedding of hair in the weeks following the treatment. This is a sign that the laser has damaged the hair follicles.

Clinics often highlight the diode laser for its versatility.*    **Excel HR Laser**: The Excel HR laser Charlotte NC uses a combination of both Alexandrite and Nd:YAG wavelengths. This allows for treating a wider range of skin tones and hair types.
*   **Nd:YAG Laser:** The Nd:YAG laser is the safest option for individuals with dark skin tones. It has a longer wavelength that bypasses the melanin in the skin, reducing the risk of pigmentation changes. While effective, it may require more treatments than other lasers.
*   **IPL (Intense Pulsed Light):** While technically not a laser, IPL is often used for hair removal. IPL uses broad-spectrum light to target hair follicles. It is indeed less precise than lasers and may require more treatments.IPL is generally less effective than laser hair removal and may not be suitable for all skin types.

## Before and After: What Results Can You Expect?

One of the best ways to gauge the potential of laser hair removal is to look at before and after photos. Many clinics showcase laser hair removal before and after Charlotte NC results on their websites and social media pages. These images can give you a realistic expectation of the kind of hair reduction you can achieve.

While results vary from person to person, most individuals experience a significant reduction in hair growth after a series of laser hair removal treatments. Some people may even achieve permanent hair removal.Though, it's critically important to understand that laser hair removal is typically considered permanent hair reduction, not permanent hair removal. Some hair may eventually regrow,but it will usually be finer and lighter than before.

1jc6jlz,30PlusSkinCare,Med Spa shady booking policies,"Question 

Is it fair to not allow your customers to reschedule or rebook 72 hours in advance or even cancel their appointment without getting penalized?  

There’s this one MedSpa where I made an appointment but I have changed my mind and I do not want to have this appointment in regardless they took a $200 deposit and then another $200 deposit and according to their policy, you are not allowed to cancel or reschedule without forfeiting everything that you paid, including the entire amount of the procedure so basically I am locked in in somehow getting the procedure or different procedure in which I’m paying and egregious amount of money. 

It seems really unfair and unreasonable to not allow your customers to cancel an appointment 72 hours in advance and get their deposit back instead they keep your deposit and they charge you for the entire procedure despite not even getting it.

We did 2 syringes of filler in the chin/chin shadow, 1 split between the upper lip & cheeks, and then Botox all around the eyes and forehead. 

A few questions for anyone who has done chin filler:
1) how long did your bruising/swelling ast?
2) how often do you do touch ups?

And also, does anyone have experience doing ultherapy, softwave, or any of the other skin tightening treatments? Did you like the results? Trying to understand more about the minimally invasive procedures that help with the jawline.

Patient communication/messaging and portal (terrible user experience)

Electronic intake forms (they don’t populate in the chart?)

A few days ago, someone complimented my skin and asked me to share my routine, so I wrote a very long text message to her that included the attached photo. I've learned so much from this community, and I wanted to give back by sharing my routine here.

I’m almost 37, and I have no visible wrinkles or sagging, and I’ve never had breakouts. I do have very pale sun spots, but I live in one of the sunniest cities in the U.S. and love being outdoors. While I credit genetics for my skin quality, I’ve also been dedicated to skincare for over a decade, and I truly believe it makes a difference.

In the spirit of honesty, I do Botox for my 11s and forehead twice a year. Other than that, I haven’t had any procedures.

As a trained scientist, I research everything I use extensively and stick to products with strong scientific backing.

# My Skincare Routine

**Sunscreen (daily and reapplication is non-negotiable!):**

* **ISDIN Eryfotona Ageless SPF 50** – Tinted mineral sunscreen (daily use)
* **Colorscience Sunforgettable Total Protection Face Shield Flex SPF 50** – Used as makeup
* **Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen SPF 50** – For sports and outdoor activities
* **Cetaphil Sheer 100% Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50** – For sports and outdoor activities

**Cleansing:**

* **Korres Foaming Cleanser (a)** – Currently using this from Costco; it’s affordable and gentle. Cleanser isn’t a big deal—anything that works for your skin and isn’t harsh is fine. I use it once a day in the evening.

**Evening Routine (rotating based on my skin’s needs):**

1. **Tretinoin Nights** (2-3 times a week):
   * Apply **Tretinoin 0.1% (b)** after cleansing
   * Follow with a heavy **barrier repair moisturizer** (**Aestura (f)** is my favorite)
2. **Exfoliation Nights** (2 times a week):
   * Use **Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Peel Pads (DDG pads) (d)** after cleansing
   * Follow with **Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair (ANR) (e)**
   * Seal in moisture with **Aestura (f)**
3. **Recovery & Hydration Nights** (remaining nights):
   * Apply **rosewater toner (c)**
   * Follow with **ANR (e)**
   * Lock in moisture with **Aestura (f)**

**Morning Routine (simple & quick):**

* Usually, I wash my face with just water
* Apply either:
   * **Skinceuticals CE Ferulic (g)** (been using it for 7+ years) OR
   * **Alastin A-Luminate (h)** (new, targeting sun spots—so far, so good!)
* Follow with moisturizer and **tons of sunscreen**

# Where I Buy & Pricing Info

* **Tretinoin** – Prescription only. I worked up to 0.1% over 5 years. If you're new to it, start with a lower concentration—it’s potent. Daily use isn’t necessary; **consistency is what matters.**
* **Moisturizer & Toner** – Affordable, available on Amazon.
* **ANR** – No lasting effects if you stop using it, but my skin loves it. Costco sometimes has it at a steal, so I stock up.
* **DDG Pads, CE Ferulic, & Alastin** – Pricey but last a long time. I only buy them on sale:
   * **DDG Pads** – Great Black Friday deals
   * **Alastin** – Random sales throughout the year
   * **CE Ferulic** – \~15% off every three months

1j9on7k,MedSpa,Leasing vs. Buying Medical Equipment: What’s the Real Money Move?,"# 

Hey everyone—so, let’s talk about a **hot (and expensive) dilemma**: **Should you lease or buy your medical equipment?**

I’ve seen so many practices **hemorrhaging cash** because they rushed into a bad deal. One wrong move and BOOM—you’re stuck with outdated tech *or* drowning in lease payments that make no sense long-term.

I figured I’d break it down because **this decision can literally make or break your bottom line.**

# 🚨 Buying vs. Leasing: What They Don’t Tell You

💸 **Buying Pros:**  
✅ Own it outright = No monthly payments down the road  
✅ Tax benefits (Section 179 deduction = *big* write-offs)  
✅ No weird leasing contract clauses

❌ **Buying Cons:**  
🚧 Huge upfront cost (and let’s be real, med equipment ain’t cheap)  
🚧 Stuck with outdated machines when new tech drops  
🚧 If patient volume drops, you’re still paying for something you might not need

💳 **Leasing Pros:**  
✅ Lower upfront cost = More cash for **marketing, staff, and expansion**  
✅ Easy upgrades (because tech in this industry moves FAST)  
✅ Monthly payments can be tax-deductible

❌ **Leasing Cons:**  
🚧 Costs more in the long run (you never really “own” it)  
🚧 Contracts can be a nightmare if you need to get out early  
🚧 Some leases charge **stupid fees** for wear & tear

👉 **Still debating?** Here’s a full guide that breaks it all down:  
[**Leasing vs. Purchasing Medical Equipment: Which Option Could Save You Thousands?**](https://dermaskinsolution.com/blogs/insights/leasing-vs-purchasing-medical-equipment-which-option-could-save-you-thousands-2025-guide)

# 🔍 What’s Best for YOUR Practice?

🚀 **Leasing is better if:**  
✔️ You’re in a tech-heavy field (radiology, laser aesthetics, cardiology)  
✔️ You want flexibility to upgrade every few years  
✔️ You’d rather reinvest cash into growing your practice

🏢 **Buying makes more sense if:**  
✔️ Your equipment doesn’t go obsolete quickly  
✔️ You have steady patient volume and predictable revenue  
✔️ You want to avoid long-term financing traps

# 💡 Final Thoughts?

Honestly, **most successful practices use BOTH**—they buy **long-lasting** equipment (like exam tables, ultrasound machines) and lease **fast-evolving tech** (like lasers, imaging devices).

If you’ve been through this before, **what worked for you?** Did you regret buying something outright? Or get burned by a bad lease? Drop your thoughts below. Let’s help each other out. 👇",2025-03-12 16:51:24+00:00,1,3

1j9jf6r,30PlusSkinCare,31 (f) need suggestions for my routine!,"Alright! So!
Here is a little of my history:
Acne all my life. Went to a dermatologist 3 years ago was prescribed tretinoin. It worked for a but and then the purging never stopped (months down the line) so I stopped using it. I decided to try Inkey’s BHA. It really, what I came to find later, ruined my skin barrier. At the time I knew nothing about a skin barrier I just thought this product ruined my face and I will never not have terrible acne. I stuck to just moisturizer for the next 3 years of my life and my skin repaired some. It wasn’t until I saw a tik tok video talking about skin barrier repair that I wondered if that’s what my skin was dealing with so I bought a moisturizer that did that. This is my skin now and believe it or not it has improved like you all wouldn’t believe. 

The reason for my post is I am seeking advice with what to do with my routine now. I believe my skin is at a point where it can handle a bit more especially since I want something that will help my pores and skin be more taut (area around laughing lines is a bit saggy to me). I have had a VI Peel a few months ago and it didn’t do my skin well. So i am definitely seeking products on the gentler side. And something for acne. I have little under the skin bumps around my chin area if you guys can see that. I have sculptra for my cheek areas and masseter and DOA botox scheduled for July. Any advice would help!

Oh and my routine currently is:
Face wash
Moisturizer 
Eye cream
Sunscreen. ",2025-03-12 12:56:16+00:00,3,4

1j95pxd,30PlusSkinCare,Botox + Dysport not working,"I decided to try Botox on my 11s in November. I wanted to start conservative, so I got 15 units. After 2 weeks, it had made zero difference. So I tried a different injector (the other one had no availability) and got 10 extra units. No difference. In January, I tried Dysport. I'm not sure how many units because I was in the UK for the holidays and they charge by area there, so she gave me as much as she thought I needed. Zero difference. I went back to my US Botox lady and got 30 units two weeks ago. Zero difference.  
  
I frown in my sleep and one of my 11s is pretty deep, so I'm not expecting instant miracles, but surely there should be \*some\* difference? Also, what am I supposed to feel when I frown? I vaguely remember it being harder to frown for a few days after being injected. But that only lasts a few days, if that. Now it feels like it's completely normal. I follow all the instructions post-treatment and I haven't been to the gym for months, so I'm certainly not metabolizing through exercise 😂 Any advice would be greatly appreciated before I throw more money away.

1j956mu,MedSpa,Is Your Med Spa Leaving Money on the Table? The Numbers You Need to Know,"# Ever wonder why some med spas rake in millions while others barely break even? The difference isn’t luck—it’s strategy, pricing, and knowing your numbers.



✅ The top med spas hit **40% profit margins**  
✅ Average revenue? **$269K per year** (but top players hit **$2M+**)  
✅ Some services bring **80%+ profit**, while others barely cover costs

**So where does your med spa stand?** If you’re not tracking the right revenue benchmarks, you’re flying blind in a **$23.2 billion industry**.

👉 [**Here’s the 2024 breakdown of med spa revenue, profit margins, and what’s really driving industry growth.**](https://dermaskinsolution.com/blogs/insights/what-are-the-average-medical-spa-revenue-and-profit-margin-2024-shocking-stats)

# 💰 The Key to Higher Profits? Your Service Mix

Not all treatments are created equal. Some are **cash cows**, while others barely move the needle:

💉 **Injectables (Botox, fillers)** – 70-80% margin  
🔥 **Non-invasive body contouring** – 65-75% margin  
💡 **Laser treatments** – 60-70% margin  
🧖‍♀️ **Chemical peels** – 80-90% margin  
🔬 **Microneedling** – 75-85% margin

Your **location matters too**. Urban spas might pull higher revenue, but **lower-cost rural locations can have better profit margins** due to reduced overhead.

# 🚀 How to Boost Revenue Without Raising Prices

* **Package high & low-margin services** (Botox + LED therapy = higher ticket price)
* **Optimize pricing** (charge premium rates for peak hours)
* **Use dynamic pricing** (discount slow days, premium pricing for prime slots)
* **Track provider productivity** (high revenue per hour = higher profitability)

# 🔥 The Bottom Line

A **high-revenue med spa doesn’t always mean high profits**. The real winners are the ones optimizing margins, cutting waste, and maximizing **high-value treatments**.

So I made a checkup appointment with my dr and she switched me to Mounjaro, which insurance is paying for with the diagnosis.

1j8sa36,30PlusSkinCare,"My Skin glow up Journey, Lumecca, Morpheus 8, and PRP Eye Treatments","Hi all! Starting my little skin glow up journey as well as an overall health overhaul. I want to keep track of it somewhere and I thought maybe this was the place to do that! I just haven’t been feeling great lately and my age is showing. I am 40F and am likely perimenopausal. I had my 4th child when I was 36, this took a huge toll on my physically and mentally. He has delays and challenges with feeding, speech, and oral motor function. My stress levels have been very high. I started to notice big changes in my skin the past 9-12 months. The overall texture, some minimal jowls, loss of my signature strong bone structure (cheekbones, strong jaw). 

I started with topical Tretinoin to add to my already strong skin care regimen. 

Then, I made an appt for cosmetic mole removal (consult today) the dermatologist was not concerned about them and referred me). 

I visited a med spa a few weeks ago to discuss my concerns. She recommended 2 Morpheus 8 treatments 4-6 weeks apart. She also recommended Lumecca for my hyperpigmentation, a chemical peel, and targeted filler/botox (All of which I expected). Last Saturday, we started with Lumecca/Morpheus 8/ and PRP injections under my eyes. 

As an aside, I did start intermittent fasting and gave up caffeine the same week I had my first treatments. 

Day of: she put on my lidocaine cream and drew my blood and spun it in the centrifuge. The pain during the treatment was tolerable but pretty intense. When she went over my eyelid area, I wasn’t expecting that. My forehead and my upper cheekbones were the most sensitive. Above my lip was also not fun. She had done the IPL Lumecca treatment first, I asked her to treat my chest with the IPL laser as well, I’m sure the IPL made the Morpheus more intense. Fun fact, laughing gas did nothing for me at all. 😫 She slathered my face with my own PRP and then did the eye injections. My PRP soothed my skin but then made it really tight feeling. 

I felt like I got a really bad sunburn. It lessened as the day went on. I washed my face and used Lipid cream the nurse gave me. 

Day 1: I woke up feeling super swollen. My eyes and under eyes were the worst. I felt like everything was really full and tight. I did ice as the day went on. I also felt overall kinda “unwell”. Sore, tired, etc. I do have Fibromyalgia, I wonder if my immune system was kind of like “what the f*ck?!” I VERY gently washed my face AM and PM, I used the Lipid moisturizer again. 

Day 2: much better. Started to look more like myself. I started to see some purging (acne) and my skin feels like sandpaper. I returned to all my normal skin care and had to apply sunscreen because my kids had dentist appts, I had errands and had to leave the house. I started to notice some slight bruising on my right eye. 

Day 3: I woke up feeling much more like myself. My face feels tight and dry, I have bruising both on left under eye and right eye (side). I skipped washing first thing this morning. I wanted to just give it a rest. I will probably wash it later before I have to go out. 

I have my consultation for mole removal today and I look pretty rough. Will keep updating as I heal.

1j8qtd3,MedSpa,At-Home Microneedling vs Professional Microneedling: The Shocking Truth Your Skin Deserves to Know,"# So you’re thinking about microneedling? Cool. But let’s get one thing straight—not all microneedling is created equal.

There’s a big debate in the skincare world: **Is at-home microneedling worth it, or is it just a recipe for skin damage?** The internet is full of influencers swearing by their $30 derma rollers, while dermatologists are out here waving red flags.

If you’ve been asking yourself, **“Can I get pro-level results at home?”** or **“Do I really need to drop $500 on a clinic session?”**, you’re in the right place.

Let’s break it all down—what works, what doesn’t, and what your skin actually needs.

👉 [**At-Home Microneedling vs Professional Microneedling: The Shocking Truth Your Skin Deserves to Know**](https://dermaskinsolution.com/blogs/insights/at-home-microneedling-vs-professional-microneedling-the-shocking-truth-your-skin-deserves-to-know) 👈

# 🚨 DIY Microneedling: Budget-Friendly or a Skin Nightmare?

At-home microneedling has exploded because, let’s be real, **not everyone can afford $300+ per session at a med spa**. The appeal is obvious:

✔ **Cheap** – You can grab a derma roller for $20-100  
✔ **Convenient** – No appointments, just roll and go  
✔ **Privacy** – No awkward convos with an esthetician

BUT (and it’s a big but)… **at-home microneedling has serious risks**.

💀 **Bacteria City** – Not sterilizing properly? Enjoy your infection.  
💀 **Uneven Pressure** – Press too hard, you’re damaging skin. Too light, nothing happens.  
💀 **Wrong Needle Depth** – Most home devices don’t go deep enough for real results.  
💀 **Overuse = Barrier Damage** – You might end up with irritated, sensitive skin that *hates* you.

Sure, **some** people get decent results, but social media doesn’t show the infections, breakouts, and micro-scars from DIY fails.

# 🔬 Professional Microneedling: Worth the $$$?

Let’s talk **why pros charge $200-700 per session**—and why people are willing to pay.

✅ **Medical-Grade Needles** – Sharper, more precise, and don’t tear skin.  
✅ **Adjustable Depth** – Tailored to your specific skin needs.  
✅ **Expertise Matters** – They know *exactly* how to get max collagen stimulation.  
✅ **Sterile Environment** – No risk of using a dirty roller.  
✅ **Pro Serums & PRP** – They use medical-grade skincare post-treatment for *way* better healing.

One **professional session** often delivers **more noticeable results** than **months of DIY treatments**—because the needles actually reach the dermal layer, where collagen production happens.

💡 **TL;DR**: If you’re trying to fix **deep acne scars, wrinkles, or major skin issues**, home rollers **won’t cut it**.

# 💰 The Price Breakdown: DIY vs. Pro

|**Treatment Type**|**Cost**|**Results**|**Risks**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**At-Home Microneedling**|$20-$100|Surface-level, temporary glow|Infection, irritation, uneven healing|
|**Professional Microneedling**|$200-$700 per session|Deep collagen remodeling, long-term improvement|Minimal with proper aftercare|

One thing people don’t consider? **Fixing DIY damage can cost more than professional treatment in the first place**. If you mess up your skin barrier, **you’ll spend hundreds on recovery products, dermatology visits, and regret.**

# 🔥 Making the Right Choice for Your Skin

Still debating? Here’s how to decide:

👉 **Go DIY if:**

* You’re just looking for a small **boost in product absorption**
* You don’t have **serious skin concerns** (scars, deep wrinkles, pigmentation)
* You’re okay with **gradual, mild improvements**

👉 **Go Pro if:**

* You want **real, long-lasting results**
* You have **acne scars, deep lines, or major skin concerns**
* You want a **customized approach that’s actually safe**

If you’re set on **trying at-home microneedling**, at least do it **right**:  
✔ Use a **0.25-0.5mm needle (NEVER go deeper)**  
✔ **Sterilize properly** (70% isopropyl alcohol for 10 mins)  
✔ **Don’t use on active acne** (unless you like infections)  
✔ **Replace your roller every 10-15 uses**

# 🎯 Final Verdict

If you’re **serious about your skin**, **professional microneedling wins** every time. It’s safer, more effective, and **gives you better results in fewer sessions**.

But if you’re just testing the waters and don’t have major concerns, **a careful at-home approach might be fine**—just **don’t expect miracles**.

Your skin deserves the best—**don’t roll the dice on DIY damage.**",2025-03-11 13:32:03+00:00,0,2

- The client's name does not appear in my records.

1j865x6,AcneScars,Looking for A Legitimate Dermatologist That Can Help With Acne Scars and Microneedling Scars From A Medspa,"Hello! I don’t love talking about this but my facial scarring (both from acne and an aggressive microneedling procedure) have led me to feelings of severe insecurity. This has felt like its ruled my life ever since I went to a medspa that my dermatologist recommended that ended up severely scarring my face. I heard her literally crunching the healthy fat in my face where I previously had no scarring—I hope she didn’t realize what she was doing—and now have atrophic scarring from dermapen microneedling at 2.0 mm setting. On top of that, she was pressing deeply into my skin. One side is more scarred than the other with new scarring because she was right handed and went even more intensely on that side. Anyway, this has completely shattered my confidence. I struggle to go on dates, going out with friends feels hard, the harsh lights in elevators, parking lots, classrooms, the car ride lighting when I look in the mirror, all of it terrifies me and I feel like a monster. I know I’m a good person and I still find myself pretty but I just keep thinking about what I’ve lost from others greed. Most of my scars are rolling scars, and I would love to find a really exceptional dermatologist in LA that could help make my skin look even and healthy again. I would absolutely love some recommendations from people who haves successfully gotten their acne scars treated, or have been screwed over by other medspas in the past that have some advice moving forward. It has been over six months since microneedling scarred my face more. I have been very cautious and resistant about getting any other skin stuff done on my face because I am actually traumatized from it, but I don’t want to live being ashamed of my face for the rest of my life. If anyone has a good recommendation for a chemical peel dermatologist, pulsed dye laser, or CO2 and/or fraxel laser therapy that is not overly aggressive (won’t lead to further scarring) or do so in increments, that would be preferred. Any advice is much appreciated. Thank you!",2025-03-10 18:49:39+00:00,5,4

I’m looking for advice on achieving a slimmer, yet defined jawline - where NOT to inject given my face’s structure. 

My doctor prioritizes the therapeutic benefits, and while I trust her, I'd like to explore cosmetic balancing as well. Insurance covers everything, so cost isn't a concern. I'm just new to this procedure.

I attach the most recent sites of my forehead injections - need advice on where to put the next 100 units around my jaw for TMJ & to prevent eyebrow drooping especially my right eye.

Would it continuingly loosen up if I stop the nuface? Or the use of the device trigger some sort of change in how the skin cells metabolism of the toxins...or would the effect of microcurrent wear off after stop using it?

1j3n90m,30PlusSkinCare,My honest review of every The Ordinary product I've tried so far,"Hello!

In a world full of fake reviews I wanted to share my real, honest review of every product from The Ordinary I've tried so far. For reference, I am 38 yrs old with normal skin.

Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG: 0/5. I used a whole bottle of this and saw absolutely NO DIFFERENCE at all on my dark circles. None. What really made a noticeable difference was a Vit C serum, but not from The Ordinary.

Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA: 5/5. LOVE THIS. My go to daytime moisturiser. It makes my skin feel plump and hydrated throughout the day. It feels great under make up too.

AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution: 5/5. Be careful with this one. I don't have sensitive skin at all so I was able to tolerate this for 10 minutes from the first use. It is recommended to start slowly at first and just use it for a couple of minutes. But if you can tolerate it, it's fantastic. It makes a huge difference to my skin texture and pores. It is very strong though and I wouldn't use it more than once a week. I only use it every 15 days nowadays because I don't feel I need it as much as before.

Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toner: 4/5. Nice toner for daily use. My skin texture was better when using this one. I'm only giving it 4 stars because there is another toner from The Ordinary that I like a lot more and that has actually made a dramatic difference to my skin.

Saccharomyces Ferment 30% Milky Toner: 5/5. This is the best The Ordinary product that I have ever tried. From the first use, I noticed a HUGE difference on my skin. My skin feels so ridiculously soft now, and it's all thanks to this product. I used to feel very conscious about my skin texture and large pores, but the difference this has made is unbelievable.

Argireline Solution 10%: 1/5. They market this product as ""botox in a bottle"". Not even close. I've been using everyday it for more than 3 months and it has made 0 difference on my expression lines. Waste of money at least for me.

Multi-Peptide + Copper Peptides 1% Serum: ?/5. I've been using this every day since November and I really don't know if it's done anything for me. I only use a very small amount so I still have 3/4 left, so I think I will wait and finish my bottle before rating it. So far, I haven't really noticed anything in terms of improving signs of ageing.

Multi-Peptide Lash and Brow Serum: 2/5. I got this for free with my Slowvember order and I've been using it everyday as a lash serum. For the first few weeks it really irritated my eyelids but the discomfort has stopped now so I kept on using it. My lashes are exactly the same in terms of length... I think maybe they are not falling as much so I have a bit more volume? I'm really not sure. I would not purchase it myself though.

100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rosehip Seed Oil: 4/5 I had oily skin as a teenager so using an oil on my face felts completely ridiculous at first, but I really enjoyed this one. I use it at night and my skin does not feel greasy at all in the morning. The only thing I didn't like is the smell. It smells slightly fishy which apparently is normal. Next time I will try their new fermented version.

I hope this helps someone!",2025-03-04 22:16:22+00:00,539,84

For reference, 20% would be close to $200 extra.... I was kind of stopped in my tracks because I hadn't been asked before. Yes, we tip for nails and hair, and waxes and facials, but when it comes to injections, it just feels wrong. It's technically a medical procedure, and because they are setting their own price points, which are obviously a bit expensive, adding a tip would actually price me out of being able to afford the procedure in the first place. Of course, being me, I wasn't able to walk away comfortably/100% guilt-free...

Thoughts? 

UPDATE: it seems the issue here is that because I was at a medspa, the tipping prompt is automatic.

I've clenched my jaw my whole life and my masseters were a bit overdeveloped, so I thought getting them injected would soften my appearance and also help with the tension.

A month after the injections, my jaw had shrunken A LOT and I noticed the skin on the lower half of my face was a lot looser and I had jowls forming. My skin has always been very taught and tight to the flesh so this aged me considerably. 

I had hope that as the botox wore off, my face would return to its previous state but I'm 7 months out and my skin is still lax and sagging. I seriously want to cry. I compare pictures the month before botox compared to the month after and the difference is stark. I feel like I ruined my face at 31.

I just turned 31 and I’m looking for skincare routine help. I’ve noticed a few signs of aging and I’d like to see if I can combat it before I resort to botox. I have a bit of rosacea and I have combo skin, leaving more on the oiler side now. I’ve always had dry skin, sensitive skin. 

This is my routine currently that doesn’t break me out:

AM: 

- La Roche Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Cleanser
- Anua - Heartleaf 77% Soothing Toner
- Obagi Medical Hydrate Moisturizer 
- I rotate between Naturium Retinol Complex Serum and their BHA Liquid Exfoliant. 

Is there anything I should add to help combat the fine lines or remove? Thank you so much. 

PM: 

- La Roche Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Cleanser
- Anua - Heartleaf 77% Soothing Toner
- Obagi Medical Hydrate Moisturizer ",2025-03-03 15:20:28+00:00,1,18

1j29d7i,30PlusSkinCare,Best resurfacing laser for my goals?,"For context - I'm 31 and tend to have dry skin. I did Sciton BBL laser last summer twice, still have one session left for my face. I do botox for gummy smile and recently tried it for crows feet. My skin care routine is - AM: cleanse or micellar water, vitamin c, Paula's niacinimide, SPF/moisturize PM: cleanse or micellar, the ordinary glycolic acid 2x weekly, .05% tretinoin 4x weekly, DRTLGY needle -less serum, estrogen cream and moisturize with cerave cica balm.

The last year my skin has AGED and I'm looking to find the best resurfacing laser treatments for my goals to reduce pore size, skin texture and fine lines. I was recently diagnosed with rosacea if that impacts anything. 

As much as I'd love little to no downtime I understand that the more invasive ones require it so that's fine, but I'd rather hit it hard now or in the next year with one intense treatment than pay for several less effective ones. I did a medical grade chemical peel through my dermatologist years ago to take care of AK spots and I'm not sure if that would yield the same results as my skin goals and condition has changed since then. Photos here were taken immediately after washing my face and before any skin care was used.

1j0on07,30PlusSkinCare,Xeomin dosage,"I’ve been getting Botox / Dysport for 4 years and my dosage has always been roughly 32 units for Botox and 80 units for Dysport for a full face (I don’t have very strong muscles or any deep wrinkles. It is mostly preventative).

I went to a new injector today because the med spa I’ve been going to doesn’t offer Xeomin and I wanted to try it out to see if it lasts longer.

I was surprised that the new injector recommended 51 units to start with. My two old injectors only prescribed 2 units of Botox on each side for my eyes for crows feet prevention but this injector recommended 8 for each side. 

I pushed back because I don’t want to look frozen so she reduced my dosage to 41 total, which is still quite a lot more than what I normally get. 

I read that Botox and Xeomin dosage should be the same. It makes me wonder if I got ripped off by this new injector.

1iy4qb2,30PlusSkinCare,Feeling like I’ve aged 10 years in the last week following friends death.,"Best friend passed from cancer last week and I’ve been really struggling. Haven’t had a good nights sleep for the last 3 or so weeks as she was deteriorating and have been suffering from really bad insomnia. 

I just recently turned 32 and have been taking good care of my skin for the last 6 or so months. Current routine is as follows:

AM:
Wash with water
Apply cetaphil daily moisturiser
Vegan collagen eye serum 
SPF

PM
Double cleanse with DHC deep cleansing oil and 1025 water cleanser
Red light mask 6 minutes (the shark one) 
Medik8 copper peptides serum
Alternating nights medik8 crystal retinal1
Tatcha dewy skin cream 
Vegan collagen eye serum.

My skin is VERY dry and sensitive, I am prone to psoriasis patches (currently flaring up on my face due to current situation) but also I seem to break out very easily. I did 40 days of the blue light setting on the shark mask and have now switched to the red light. I also have the medicube booster pro but tbh felt like it was breaking me out/irritating my skin. I did 5 months of skin+me and found the tret too irritating so switched to medik8, have been using it for 3 weeks now. 

I’m at the end of my dewy skin care cream and can’t really afford to replace it. Can anyone recommend a cream that will match it, and maybe a more hydrating day cream too? I looked into the haruharu one for night and the purio gel one for day. Would these be a good choice? 

No idea what to do about my skin! I feel like my forehead has so many fine lines, especially above my eyebrows, I’m considering Botox now. Lots of a face sagging is also present and seems to have come on so suddenly. We won’t talk about the eye bags 😔 please help me, is my routine crap?

1ixc728,30PlusSkinCare,Advice Needed: Pre-Wedding Cosmetic Treatments & Long-Term Skincare Journey,"Hi everyone,

I had my first consultation with a skin treatment clinic today and I'm feeling a mix of excitement and uncertainty about my options. I'm considering a few treatments:

* Improving my overall skin tone, as I deal with redness, chickenpox scars, and some pigmentation issues on my cheek and upper lip. 
* Reducing my forehead wrinkles (which I've had since my early twenties; they're not deep yet but annoying).
* And, according to the analysis I got done, dark undereyes, lots of crows feet and enlarged pores (although I don't care about those that much yet tbh).

I’m getting married in May, so I’d love to make some tweaks for the wedding while also setting the foundation for a long-term skincare journey. I'm aiming for natural-looking results and am a bit torn on where to start.

Would starting with a CO2 laser treatment paired with PRP be too extreme at this stage, or should I take a slower approach - even though I feel like it would cover most skin concerns all at once? Perhaps a few Botox tweaks might suffice for now? I'd really appreciate any advice, personal experiences, or guidance on how to balance short-term improvements with long-term skincare investments.

Thanks in advance for your help!",2025-02-24 20:33:39+00:00,1,0

1ix5a00,30PlusSkinCare,Any real advantages of Botox over Upper Bleph?,"I wanted to fix my eyes for years now and the surgeon I consulted today recommended to try Botox first. I was initially sceptical but then agreed to it. However, now I'm wondering if its worth trying or if I should just do the surgical procedure straight away. I feel like getting Botox 3 times a year, risking varying results, and possibly having only a minor improvement, if any, isnt really worth it and I should just do the surgery.

Are there any real advantages of trying botox first? Has anyone been super happy with the results achieved?

1iwmo9b,30PlusSkinCare,"I want to go HAM on my 11s, I'd like some feedback on my game plan","edit: updated after feedback

(also posted to the micro needling sub but this community does not allow cross posts)

M53. I've been scowling at computer code for 20 years which has left me with some pretty deep 11s.

I've been doing red light therapy with a Mito 300 for about 9 months now. I'm not really happy with the results. I've been doing 10 minutes a night, which is the recommended dosage from the manufacturer. That's at a distance of about 6 inches. I think it's made improvements, but I'd like to speed it along.

I've also been doing  ~~Dysport~~ Botox, three sessions 3 months apart so far. Next session is in 3 weeks.

I read that copper peptide couples well with microneedling, so my new game plan:

* microneedling once per month on the 11s area, depth. 0.5 mm, 12 pin cart
* copper peptide from The Ordinary before the microneedling (whole face? Just the area that I'm trying to improve?)
* daily: 10 minutes of red light therapy 
* on MN day: no tretinoin; on regular days, tret before bed
* daily sunscreen

What do you think? Any areas for improvement? Any glaring mistakes?

\* I don't think the tret has an effect on the deep wrinkles, I'm just including it here in case it is contraindicated",2025-02-23 22:38:16+00:00,1,7
1iwk083,30PlusSkinCare,Considering masseter botox and want to ask some questions of those who have done it.,"So, I'm a 31 year old dude and have always had a very lean, slim face with defined cheek bones. I liked the way I look. But over the past few years it seems like my masseter muscles have exploded in width, and unevenly too (one side is wider than the other). I used to have a rectangular, longer face. I dislike how my face looks and I know what caused it. I picked up the habit of chewing on things. Mainly plastic soda bottle caps. I chew them until they're flat and my jaw is sore. It's a stupid anxious habit that I only do when I'm at home at night just hanging out. I thought I'd try to stop for like 6 months to see if there was any size reduction, but there hasn't been unfortunately. I'm not diagnosed but I believe I have some form of TMJ that this may be exacerbating (my jaw cracks when I open wide, etc).

So anyway, I'm now considering masseter botox. My questions are mainly the following:

If I \*am\* able to stop chewing on things, will the shrinkage be permanent? I heavily suspect my jaw width solely came from the chewing. It could be normal aging I guess, but my face was lean my entire life until the previous two years, when I picked up the habit of chewing. I also don't think it's normal aging, nothing else about my face has changed significantly, nor have I gained any weight over what I weighed when my face was lean. My thinking is that if the chewing caused it, and I get botox and also stop the chewing, the results should be permanent, no? I'd be ceasing the thing that caused the muscle growth so even without repeat injections, they should just stay smaller.

Next question, how much should this cost? I'm in a major city in the U.S midwest, and looking it up, there has been a huge variation in price estimates. Everywhere from $300 per session to $1500 per session, depending on how many units they determine I need. What is a normal price for this kind of thing?

And final question: How many times will I need to do this to see results? I called a place that does it and they said around two months between sessions, and that I should do it at least three times. I don't have any reason to distrust them but I also know they're trying to sell me on this, and I really don't want to spend thousands just to find out it was a waste of money.

This whole thing has caused me severe stress, to the point I avoid mirrors and photos. I just want my symmetrical and lean jaw back, and I'm reading that this can do it for me in a way that is minimally invasive. So please, if you've done it and have some answers to these questions, I'd love to hear your opinions on it. Even an improvement of a few millimeters would be acceptable to me.

Also, sorry if this breaks any rules. I saw a good amount of posts have been made here about masseter botox, so that's why I'm asking here. I don't know if this counts as skin care and I will remove it if it is deemed out of place by mods. Thank you.",2025-02-23 20:42:53+00:00,1,3

1iu4hul,30PlusSkinCare,"Looking for Feedback on Skincare Treatment Plan from Aesthetician (Microneedling, Lasers, etc.)","Hi everyone, I recently went for a skin consultation with an esthetician to see what treatments would work for my skin. I’m a 37-year-old female, and the only thing I’ve done so far is Botox.

I’ve lost some weight recently, but I’ve noticed a few skin concerns:

* Under-eye lines
* Crow’s feet (all the way down my cheeks)
* Lots of red and dark spots, mainly from melasma that developed during pregnancy.
* I tan well but have spent a lot of time in the sun over the years, which has contributed to some skin damage.

Here’s the plan they recommended:

* Microneedling through the summer (since I plan to be outside a lot).
* Clearlift laser treatments, more microneedling, and Opus in the fall and winter.

The total cost is estimated to be around $8k.

I’d love to hear if anyone has tried these treatments, what their experiences have been, or if this plan sounds like a good one for my skin concerns. Any advice or feedback would be really appreciated!

1istx6x,30PlusSkinCare,Permanent Frown Line Between Eyebrows,"I'm a 35-year-old male, and I've developed a permanent frown line between my eyebrows. Even when I don't frown, I have a deep wrinkle in that area that almost looks like a dent in the skin, with no muscle or fat underneath. Despite regularly getting Botox, the fold doesn't seem to go away. My doctor believes Botox can prevent the wrinkle from getting worse but won't eliminate the deep fold in the skin. I've also tried retinol cream and microneedling with no improvement.

The doctor has suggested filler as the only way to address the line, but I'm concerned about the risk of blindness. She reassures me that she’s been practicing for over 20 years and uses a cannula, so the risk of complications is minimal. Still, I’m not fully comfortable with the idea of getting filler in that area.

Are there any other treatments I could try, or is filler really the only effective solution for this type of wrinkle?

1ino4tj,30PlusSkinCare,Severely botched dysport - looking like the queen of sausage cheeks + midface is melting,"Was treated with Dyport by my regular med spa that I’ve been going to for years, the head is ranked top 100 injectors in America for awhile now. She went on maternity leave and hired someone with more experience than her. I was treated with this person who happens to be a nurse one time and had good results. During my second treatment, I wanted to get rid of the under eye jelly roll. I’ve been treated there in the past (not by this replacement injector but by the head of the med spa) with about one unit of Botox and it looks fantastic, with a little lines in there being a little bit shorter. This injector put in six units of dysport on each side. Four pokes on each side, some of them very close to my lash line. She also said do you want some in your DAO? i’ve never had the DOA injected because my smile does not turn down, but she said it would turn my smile up even more so I said OK why not. I don’t recall exactly how many units it may have been three on each side. 

Also want to point out a month before I did two syringes Skinvive in my cheek cheeks and nasolabial and my face was perfectly plump. This was done at my other injector (I was bouncing back-and-forth between two med spas, and I’ve learned my lesson to only sick with one). It was so noticeable that the replacement injector that did the disport made a comment. What did you do to your face? You look fantastic. I don’t wanna hurt her feelings so I said I was doing micro, needling, microcurrent, and red light therapy.

The day after the dysport treatment, I immediately noticed that all of a sudden, under my eyes became extremely hollow and like I had really dark . The fine lines turned into deep creases and the skin became really creepy. I hadn’t even been wearing concealer for months because I was also doing PRF under eye with another provider and it completely erased my dark circles. All of a sudden, my eyes became worse looking than when I had started with the dysport. 

I immediately contacted the office and the excuse was that there was swelling and bruising, and it would go down . I also told them that my cheeks looks like a bunch of sausages all of a sudden, and that there was a weird dip right under the tear trough and the cheek was not smooth looking. They kept insisting to let it settle and give it the two weeks. I had a follow up appointment and the injector said I can promise you you’re gonna love your results. Here I am now three weeks later looking my worst. under eye lines look horrific. I also suffer from dry eye disease, and have noticed my eyes have gotten significantly dry when they were doing better in fact. My cheeks look so ugly that I don’t even wanna be seen in public. I’ve been wearing dark sunglasses and trying not to smile or look in the mirror because it makes me so depressed. where are the dysport was injected in the DAO, looks worse than before there’s more prominent lines around my mouth and the small pre-jowl/fat pad that I had is way more noticeable. No matter how much I microcurrent or use my Gua sha tool, my nasolabial folds are much cheaper than they were before almost like my cheeks are going downward instead of up upward.

it literally looked like my skinvive treatment was reversed and that I aged 10 years in three weeks. Significant hollows under eyes and there’s a shelving where the eye trough meets the cheek. 

i’ve been in touch with the med spa constantly and explicitly told them that she used too many units and it was improperly placed based on what I’ve read on real self plastic surgeons blogs and looking through other Reddit threads. The only excuse I have is that I should come in and see they had the practice to see what she can do. I feel like I’m a masochist to go back there because what can they do putting in more Botox isn’t gonna help I’m certainly not putting filler under my eyes. I highly doubt they’re gonna do a Morpheus8 treatment on me for free and they don’t even have CO2 lasers there. 

I feel like I’m just stuck looking really ugly for the next couple of months until it wears off and I’m hoping that it revert back to what I look like. Lesson learned for me I won’t be doing much Botox anymore Going forward anywhere on my face. I’ll be sticking to microcurrent, micro, needling, and facial acupuncture. I can’t believe for all these years we were all thinking that Botox is the answer and making everyone look younger  when it only does the first few years that you’re doing it then you have the reverse effect.

1ina1mr,30PlusSkinCare,"Lost myself, help!","Hi friends.

I've been thinking about posting here for a while. I had a baby about 1.5 years ago and am pregnant again and I feel like I've just LOST MYSELF. My skin has never been like this. I've always taken care of me. I have a lot of red patches near my nose that won't go away, more breakouts and dry skin. 

I have just lost the motivation to even take care of me. Here was my old routine:

Morning-- Dry cleanse, Vit c, Eye cream, Celimax, ceraminde moisturizer , Spf 

NIGHT--Oil cleanse, Second Cleanse, Mist face (Toner?), Argeline, Matrixyl (hyaluronic acid), Celimax, Eye Cream, Retionol, Moisturizer, Skin Glaze

It got kinda expensive and I just don't have the time. Now I'm not even sure where to start. You guys are freaking gurus and would love to hear any product suggestions. I was about to use Rhodes (Hailey Bieber) full system because I just need something easy and possibly easier than what I was doing. Also wanted to try a very clean cleanser like
-VI derm purifying cleanser or alitura the pearl cleanser. Has anyone tried these?

Any suggestions or skin routine are greatly appreciated. I'm turning 35 and don't do botox, anything preventative would be great as well. 

Thanks, 
A frumpy mom",2025-02-11 21:31:29+00:00,0,21
1ihrfz9,PlasticSurgery,Got a lip flip yesterday,"I got a lip flip yesterday. This is my second one, I got 6 units of jeuveau. Last time was mid december, and that was 4 units of dysport I believe. I didn’t really feel like the 4 units did anything. Other people who got lip flips from that injector had the same experience. 

So, here is the thing. My boyfriend came over last night. The injector told me I could kiss but no intense making out. I completely forgot and definitely did more than intense making out. 

I don’t notice anything wrong but I know it isn’t something you instantly see. Please help. 😭",2025-02-04 20:23:06+00:00,1,0
1ig8qne,MedSpa,Vagaro does not allow points and discounts to be used,"My brain can't handle this pickle so hoping someone here can offer a solution. I offer memberships where the person banks points each month and the points can be used towards their cosmetic services. I mostly use Jeuveau, which offers the person $40 each visit that I want to offer them. The issue is Vagaro considers the points a discount and they do not allow you to combine discounts, even manually. I've tried multiple ways to enter it to allow the person to receive the rewards. The EMR does not allow a discount greater than the unit purchase price so can't just enter $40 discount and use a code. I want a streamlined process so my receptionist is not doing math at time of checkout.

I've reached out to Vagaro- no meaningful solution other than they will pass it onto the team. 

Jeuveau ""reimburses"" me by giving product for so many treatments logged so I do not want to enter it using the ""other"" payment source  because it will show as revenue.   
  
Right now, the best solution I have come up with is the give them additional 40 points in their bank and apply it at time of checkout. ",2025-02-02 21:50:08+00:00,0,3

There’s some students from a school in the Denver area that told me they are being trained to get certified in providing Botox and filler. Considering this penetrates into the dermis, how could this be legal for an esthetician to perform?
IS it even legal? I’m genuinely curious because even as a practicing esti for 10 years I would not trust anyone besides a medical professional to do injectables for me.

1hztuot,PiriformisSyndromeHou,"Daxxify.  Kicks in faster, lasts longer than exiting types. ","This is a new type of Botox.  Fishman recently completed a clinical trial using Daxxify. I'm about to get a big ass dose.  

On September 7, 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the drug Daxxify. DaxibotulinumtoxinA-land, or Daxxify, is a new type of neuromodulator derived from botulinum toxin. 

How is Daxxify different from the other neuromodulators on the market today?
""Botox, Dysport, Xeomin, Jeuveau, those all have some sort of proprietary associated proteins on them which come as part of the manufacturing process that doesn't have any real biologic activity,"" said Sara Dickie, MD. ""The difference with Daxxify is that it has a proprietary peptide. It's a shorter chain than a protein. This peptide has some activity to it.""

While the science behind injectables may not be the first thing that interests prospective patients, the science matters.

""The peptide is vegan and non-derived from any kind of human source, so that is probably the most significant difference,"" said Katerina Gallus, MD, FACS.

The peptide exchange technology in Daxxify sets it apart from other botulism derivatives that use human albumin or animal proteins. Not only is the product vegan, but the unique peptide formula has an active purpose, as explained by Dr. Dickie, which also gives the injectable a few distinct benefits over rivals like Botox.

1hyyfg9,Esthetics,Curious if other estheticians have noticed loss of volume in some clientele on one side of their face ,"Hello! I’ve been doing esthetics for 4 years now, on average (and on a good pay period) I see about 25-40 clients every two weeks. I have a lot of regulars that I am ever so grateful for as well. 

I’ve noticed majority of my clientele aged mostly around 35+ (sometimes younger than 30 but usually only if they admit to regular filler and Botox) - that the right side of their face has a substantially less amount of volume than the other. 
Cheeks and under eye area especially, where the left side is lifted, rounded more and overall just has much more volume than the other side.

Is this common to see? I’m wondering if the filler or Botox possibly migrated over a few years, or if they use the nerves and muscles on the left side more. I know the sides of the face are not identical (they are sisters, not twins - just like our eyebrows) but it’s been alarming sometimes seeing just how much volume loss on only one side is apparent on some clients. 
Could it be sleeping habits? I know even the side of our mouth we chew with should change every so often so one side doesn’t become more defined than our prominent side - but this has been making me scratch my head and I’m wondering if other estheticians have seen this as well!

1ho9py6,30PlusSkinCare,I get scars from Botox needles. Help? ,"I have little scars all over my forehead from getting Botox (and Jeuveau) injections. I didn’t see any after my first few times, but after the 4th time I noticed them when the tox wore off. I thought maybe it was the injector so I went to a different clinic. Now I have tiny donut shaped scars all over my forehead. 

I talked to two different injectors about this and they basically told me “that doesn’t happen.” I was like… uhhh, do you see these scars? They said yes, but I guess cognitive dissonance didn’t really allow them to acknowledge it and they offered no solutions. I loved getting Botox, but I don’t want a scar filled forehead. Has anyone else experienced this and found any solutions for the scarring? Does anyone know if there’s a way to continue with injections but reduce or eliminate the scarring?

1hk14ia,40PlusSkinCare,Neurotoxin and annual cost?,"I’m in my mid 40’s and I’ve only tried neurotoxin twice. The first time was Botox in my late 30’s, I believe I got around 60 units all together, in my forehead, 11s, and crows feet. It took the full 2 weeks to take full effect and around 9 weeks after injections it was completely gone. So I only got about 7 weeks or maybe less out of it. Last year I tried Jeuveau hoping it would last longer, but it didn’t. It kicks in much faster, but around 8-9 weeks it was also completely gone. My question is, if I want to upkeep the effects will I have to go in every 8 weeks (or less?) and it takes the same amount of units as initially? How much are you spending on neurotoxin annually? I don’t think I can do every 2 months financially. My mom is 67 with unrealistically youthful looks and skin and all she does is Botox twice a year.

1h7cfy4,Esthetics,"What is your definition of plastic surgery, or “having work done” ? ","I always see online people debunking celebrity faces guessing what type of work they’ve had done or why their face look different?

But sometimes they lump in things that I wouldn’t consider plastic surgery. I feel like a IPL, chemical peels, micro needling, PRP, etc. are not plastic surgery. I see these treatments as non surgical and they’re not necessarily permanent either. 

Now, when it comes to Botox and filler, I personally would call them enhancements because you do have to go back and get more, but it can alter your face to where people say they’ve had “work done“. 

First, when someone says they’ve had work done what does that mean to you personally? Does that mean going under a literal knife or any treatment on the skin?   

Second, what services would you consider not plastic surgery but others do because of the results or misconception of what they think it is ? ",2024-12-05 15:59:38+00:00,5,7

1fpidpz,Esthetics,Illinois Esties: Question about scope of practice.,"Ummm I am so confused. 
I went to school in Indiana and we learned micro/hydraderms in school. I got my licensed transferred to Illinois in 2018.
I was double checking to see if dermaplaning was out of scope bc the esty at my new job has been doing it and last I checked it was out of scope for us. 
But my manager had mentioned that she said RF treatment was out of scope bc we have one on our hydraderm machine. 
So i looked and this is what it said 

""In Illinois, estheticians are not permitted to perform procedures that affect the living layers of the skin, or that are considered the practice of medicine. These include:
Botox, Chemical peels, Collagen injections, Dermaplaning, Hydrafacial machine treatment, Liposuction, Microblading, Microneedling, and Radio frequency.""

Now I'm so confused bc we also learned how to do microderms/hydraderms in school and i just quit Massage Envy and we offered them there but not dermaplaning bc it's out of scope so I'm so confused. 
A little help please!!
So many spas offer hydraderms so I don't see how it's out of scope?? 
Do I need to inform my manager that we can't do any of that?? 
How are other esties getting away with it and why do companies even sell these machines to esties if we aren't even allowed to perform them??",2024-09-25 23:25:02+00:00,4,1

***If you've had any experience with Botox, Dysport, Xeomin, Nabota /Jeuveau or Neuronox I'd love to hear it.***

I am planning on getting my first 'botox' treatment for my forehead and glabellar lines (in between my eyebrows). 

I've never done this before so I don't know what 'botox' to ask for.

Can't find any reviews in English on Youtube so looking for some first hand experience.

1faqwyu,Esthetics,Pay and commission structure for new med spa ,"Hello Everyone. My wife and I are both healthcare professionals and are planning on starting a med spa from scratch next year. We plan to offer simpler services like basic 30 min facials + add-ons for services like enzyme peels and extractions. We’re aiming for a lower price point ($60/base facial + $15-30 addons) and a membership structure (4 base facials/month for $120 and discounted add-ons). The exact prices aren’t established yet but that’s the gist of the model we’re going for while we build up our clientele before adding services like Botox and fillers. 

Neither are us are too familiar from the business side of cosmetics so I wanted to solicit your opinions on a good payment and commission structure for the Estheticians we plan to hire. 

We obviously want our staff to have some skin in the game and nudge clients towards purchasing memberships, add-ons, and products. Given that we’re going for a high volume model plus aggressively marketing our services we’re hoping our staff can service 2 clients per hour for most of the day so they can supplement their income with optional tips.


What’s a fair base pay and commission model to keep our staff happy, engaged, and not looking to jump ship? For reference min wage in my state is $16 but our area is very low cost of living compared to the more metropolitan areas.

Thanks in advance!",2024-09-06 21:44:40+00:00,1,27
1f9yodc,Esthetics,Esthetics --> RN || ABSN Program or ELMSN/DEMSN,"Hello! For context, I am from California and have an unrelated Bachelor's degree. I recently got my Esthetician license end of last year. I really loved the science portion of my education and I am looking to pursue higher education and potentially get my RN to expand my scope of services. I would love to be an esthetic nurse to do laser, botox, fillers, microneedling, and other services. 

Also, in case this information matters, I would eventually like to move to another state in the future  
(I wish I knew information about this in regards to being an Esthetician).

I am currently looking into accelerated BSN and MSN programs as I have a non-science degree. Looking into California schools, as well as out of state because I know how competitive it is here. Possibly looking at schools in Chicago. Has anyone had any experiences?

I am leaning towards MSN because I would be able to take out federal loans, as I have used the funds up for my first Bachelors. I also like the career mobility options in case I need to pivot. I do know people's experiences and struggles of finding a MSN job without a previous RN or other degree, but I am okay with that and building up my career and salary slowly through work experience.

My only question is if this is a good career path for me. I know that MSN or the programs I am looking into do not have aesthetic nurse specifically. Would I still be able to get into the medical aesthetic field with an MSN? I am sure there will be difficulties without connections, but would I still be a good candidate? Is this a good pathway to take to become an aesthetic nurse? Do MSNs eventually make more than regular RNs at med spas?

Has anyone done this career pathway? How did it work out?

I am still researching heavily about this topic, so any advice and input would be appreciated. ",2024-09-05 21:56:15+00:00,1,1

# How does Botox work? 

Basically this bacteria produces a toxin which we have isolated and modified for controlled use. The toxin, Botulinum-A, binds to a specific area of the neuron that innervates your muscles and inhibits the muscles ability to contract.

(Happy to go into the SNARE protein and the inhibition of binding to the synaptic vesicle trapping acetylcholine- but you don't have to understand that level of physiology. But if curious feel free to ask) 

https://preview.redd.it/fxe1enr7wl9d1.png?width=1112&format=png&auto=webp&s=69509c598a458311318f902477b28cd02f2d5a4c

To make a vial of neurotoxin you need the following 3 components:

* **The Active Neurotoxin** (e.g., botulinum toxin type A or B).
* **A Carrier Protein** (commonly human serum albumin, or in Daxxify’s case, a synthetic peptide) to help protect and transport the toxin.
* **Additional Stabilizers** (such as sodium chloride, lactose, or sucrose) to maintain the product’s stability and shelf life.

Each of current, biggest brands on the US market differ by one of the ingredients above, i.e.

* Botox: Serum Albumin (HSA) and sodium chloride
* Dysport: Human Serum Albumin and lactose
* Xeomin: Human Serum Albumin and sucrose
* Jeuveau: Human Serum Albumin and sodium chloride
* Daxxify: **Proprietary 35–amino acid synthetic peptide** (rather than albumin)

If your wondering which one to go with, it honestly doesn't really matter especially for your first treatment. Dealers choice is usually a safe bet.

Now the best part is that botox doesn’t bind there forever, **AND there is a dose dependent curve: meaning the more you inject the less movement you will have.** 

So off the bat, if you’re worried about looking artificial or “frozen”. Don’t be. You can receive botox injections and modify the dosing to accomplish varying degrees of paralysis of that area. This is where the concept of “baby botox” came in- or “preventative botox”.

It’s also a great segue to make a key point: 

Using selective paralyzation and dosing we can achieve different effects- which is why it’s become such a popular treatment. It’s a misconception that botox is reserved solely to reduce fine lines and wrinkles, my dear friend it can do so much more. Because our face is basically just a bunch of different vectors of movement, we can modulate those vectors of movement. Botox's side effect is that it reduces wrinkles- but its not the mechanism of action.

Simply put, you know who makes wonderful candidates? Those with facial asymmetries. So... everyone!

Simultaneously, when paralyze a muscle there’s minor atrophy, which shrinks it. So if your forehead muscle has become slightly smaller but it's still attaching to the lower part of your face, guess what's going to happen? It will lift it. You inject your masseter muscles on the side of your face? Great no TMJ and your facial shape is now more oval. 

Then there are the long term or preventative aspects: that area becomes “smooth” eliminating everything from deep set wrinkles to static creases. It’s why it's never too late to get it- or too soon to start. I mean within reason obviously. I think if you’re old enough to buy alcohol, fuck it-old enough to vote, if you want botox so be it. But static lines, causing that gross little layer of concealer to form- those are the first signs of aging and they start fucking early. You just had to use your face. 

So overview: 

1. Paralysis of muscle (via inhibition of motor signaling) = smooth muscle → smooth skin 
2. Paralysis leads to atrophy overtime = muscle become smaller/shorter → lifted appearance or slimed areas of the face 
3. Paralysis can be selective and dose dependent allowing for facial balancing and overall increase harmony of the face.
4. The combined effects inhibit static crease formation minimizing the need to address them later in life, when they become more apparent from general laxity in the skin. 

# What areas can be treated with Botox? 

Literally whatever the fuck you want you gorgeous human being. We can start with what's been FDA approved for, which is actually just the upper portion of the face, but don’t let that stop you. 

The muscles in your face can be categorized as either an “elevator” or a “depressor”. They either contract upward or they contract downward. But of course, not as simple as that. Take the orbicularis oculi- yes its a depressor, but its the circle muscle surrounding your eye allowing you to open and close them. It’s contraction is more advanced than just depressing downward. Here take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/5vxm0e2nwl9d1.png?width=904&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac696e7add80063b54b86f358bd63921966c5309

These are the muscle strength vectors of the facial muscles. The arrows correspond to the direction of the muscle force. The expression lines created by muscle contraction are perpendicular to the vectors shown.

As time has gone on we have experimented and found that injecting based on the vector of muscle action can produce lovely effects and we can eliminate or reduce the “expression” lines everyone is complaining about.  

Below is something called an injection map. When you get your botox, your injector will log where it was placed and how many units were administered. This can be used as a guide to speak with your practitioner about your areas of concern, what the effect will be and the cost based on the average amount of units used in that area.

https://preview.redd.it/zn1irntuxl9d1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf0bf3ddfde4d5923ac40987993f61b105be8cf6

# Is Botox safe? Is it possible to develop immunity? 

Just like anything there are potential complications- but these are incredibly rare. BoNT/A is one of the most widely studied drugs in the world, and although the safety and efficacy studies are positive, there are several potential adverse effects- but thankfully no reported deaths when used cosmetically. 

The first one that everyone is thinking of is Ptosis, or getting a saggy eye, but luckily there are more than just one area that this can happen to. :)

Undesired muscle impairment, ptosis of the eyelid(s), ptosis of the brow, asymmetry of brows or smile, plateau smile or “dolls eyes” (orbital area), and decreased efficacy are all adverse effects related to technique and/or local diffusion of the BoNT/A into surrounding muscle fibers. This is what they look like: 

https://preview.redd.it/bv5qn767yl9d1.png?width=1846&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ae214caa72e666e722792858b78634f6bbe7180

If this happens, you can get someone to inject some other parts of your face to balance it out- but honestly just wait it out. While you might want to blame the injector- it's honestly just a crap shot. For every 1000 gorgeous smooth human, one of them pays the karmic debt for everyone else. And frankly you still look beautiful when lopsided. I wouldn’t let this be the reason to keep you from getting it done.   

There is also a very small percentage of the population that have an allergic reaction. 

And finally yes, people can develop resistance to botox, kinda sorta. However, the degree and frequency of this occurring is highly debated, mostly because it’s difficult to test and no one really cares. What I can say is that it seems as though it’s related to how frequently you get injected during a period of time, versus developing “resistance” in the pharmaceutical sense where it just doesn’t work any more. 

As you see above in the mechanism of action section, botox inhibits muscle movement by keeping Ach from entering the synaptic cleft. Your neuron can compensate for this by producing more Ach, and it will, but not by much and not indefinitely.

Long story short- you’re not developing resistance. But at the same time adding more isnt going to do anything because its reached its maximum therapeutic effect. So you might just be stronger than botox- who knows.

The other major consideration, and what is thought to be the more likely explanation is that Botox can be a little bit of a bitch. The second it gets too warm, I'm talking like a week or two outside a fridge it loses potency, and the second it gets too hot it’s inactive.

So more likely than not, if you're getting botox from anywhere that does not maintain lab grade, sanitary medical conditions- it's probably just weak shit.      

# What does the procedure entail? Is it painful? downtime? 

When you arrive your injector will assess your concerns and what can be done about them. They may point out different areas that you don’t think need to be injected, this is typically not an attempt to upsell you but they will know the anatomy that needs to be injected to achieve the results you would like. 

For example, if you would like your forehead wrinkles to be gone, you're most likely going to have to get the space between your eyebrows done too. This means an additional \\\~10-30 units in the glabella in conjunction with the \\\~12-30 units in your forehead. Ironically it's going to create more lines if you can’t lift your forehead but you can still furrow your brow.

Ideally you will know your own pain tolerance to a 32g needle prior to your first injection- which is approximately the size of an insulin needle. But an important note: For those of you who experience vasovagal response to needles- this wont be much different than your previous experiences with injections. If anything you should consider the location of Botox, aka your face, and investigate if this might increase syncope or pain.

If this is the first time you’re having a needle stuck in your face- TYPICALLY it’s reported to feel like a pinch, and different parts of the face will be more uncomfortable than others. Like your lips. Lips hurt like a bitch.

If you do have concerns regarding pain let your injector know before hand. Topical lidocaine takes 30-40 mins to become active and so your injector will ask you to come in early to accommodate this- it’s going to be difficult for them to do so on the spot. It wouldn’t be unreasonable for them to ask you to reschedule- but arguably it’s unreasonable for them to flat out refuse, especially if you have a pre existing condition.

Also botox is like getting a manicure. You’re going to vibe better with some injectors than others. Don’t be afraid to go to different places and see what different people are capable of doing. I mean you can go to a lot of various nail salons but my girl Candy on Pico gets my gel x-extention round almond shape better than any one. 

You'll be done in about 15-20 mins and then sit in your car feeling guilty about how much money you spent. However, you will start to feel its effects within 24 hrs, especially as a newbie. And in 7-10 days you'll ask yourself why you didn’t start doing this sooner. Btw the effects you feel within the first several days are your muscles starting to tighten and it can feel stronger than anticipated considering how little effect you see. This is not a complication or something wrong, but don't be surprised if it feels like a tension headache or fairly achy.   

Finally, you want to remain upright for about 4 hours afterwards. This is to ensure you don't have migration. So don’t rub the area, no cliff jumping, and def avoid doing a bunch of handstands- as hard as that may be.

\*Technically studies have shown that the neurotoxin fully binds to its target site after 1 hour, but I don't want anyone blaming me when you waited 61 mins to go sky diving and still had a problem. Same with your injector.

# How long does Botox last? So we can manage expectations and plan future treatments. 

Hard to answer- quick and dirty 3-4 months maybe 6ish, but it depends on many factors. There have been times I noticed it wearing off within 2 months and I have been able to get away with 5 months between treatment. But I will also say that the more you keep up with it- arguably you save a bit more. If you stay on top of it, you’ll pay less for a touch up than having to  

# Can Botox be used for other purposes besides cosmetics? Do you have migraines, excessive sweating, jaw clenching? 

Yes. Too lazy to elaborate here, but its great for headaches and TMJ issues. If you are seeking injections for TMJ problems or jaw clenching I suggest you go someplace other than a med spa. Your TMJ is a pretty complex area in your face, and surprisingly a dentist is better person to help you with this issue than someone who will give you the standard 30 units without assessing your bite. 

# Are there any alternatives to Botox?

Yes. Shit tons and shit tons. They all have the same underlying modality- but every country has its own selection of candy at the checkout aisle.  

# Who is a suitable candidate for Botox? Can I get it while pregnant or breastfeeding? 

Botox is generally safe and effective for most people. Here are the few exceptions: 

1. Pregnancy and Breastfeeding: Unfortunately a no go. I have talked to other people on this sub about this and I am open about the fact that when I am pregnant I probably will keep injecting. Why? Because I dream of becoming a selfish, negligent mother. The logic: the contra-indication of Botox injections during pregnancy or while breastfeeding has not been established. It doesn't mean it exists. But, it’s going to be very hard to get funding to give a bunch of pregnant women botox- and a retrospective study would be equally unfounded financially. Welcome to motherhood. The sacrifices have already begun. But I want it to be clear, because i'm a science person or whatever, the reason why its counter indicated, is not that it's been found to be teratogenic or make your baby psychic- we just don't have proof that it won't… So your hurdle is finding a provider willing to do it. They don’t like getting sued and an easy way to minimize that risk is by not giving your pregnant ass botox.
2. Certain Medical Conditions: Individuals with certain neurological disorders or muscle conditions: myasthenia gravis or Lambert-Eaton syndrome could potentially worsen with Botox treatment. 
3. Allergies or Sensitivity: A known allergy to any ingredient in Botox or a history of adverse reactions to previous Botox injections would typically exclude someone from being a candidate. 
4. Muscle Weakness: If a person has significant weakness in the muscles targeted for Botox treatment, it might affect the effectiveness or safety of the procedure. 
5. Medication Interactions: Some medications, particularly those that interfere with neuromuscular transmission or blood thinners, could increase the risk of complications with Botox injections. 
6. Infection at Injection Site: If there's an infection at the planned injection site, healthcare providers typically postpone Botox treatment until the infection clears to prevent spreading the infection or complicating the healing process. Or getting sued. 

# How much does Botox cost? 

Generally, expect to spend between $8 and $15 per unit of Botox. For the minimal treatment areas like the forehead, middle of the brows, and around the eyes, that could total $200 to $300. However, prices can vary widely—I've paid up to $500 before, but once got it for a baffling $150 due to some promotion (though I suspect they stole my social security number—it was worth it for me personally).

It's worth looking into programs that let you accumulate points for future discounts—sites like Alle and Aspirerewards offer these. I don't know how they work exactly; I just always mention I have an account. Think of it like a punch card—if you don't bring it up, they won't stamp it. I've been pleasantly surprised with $50 off here and there.

Mind you, I’ve seen places cost as much as 20 a unit- but fuck that. Don’t pay that much. While it will always depend on where you live, the saturation and demand of the market- botox is purchased whole sale and then increased via a 50-75% markup, cus this is America baby. No matter how many units a location is purchasing- $20 a unit is astronomical.

I encourage you to ask how much locations charge per unit, if they are offering promotions, and if you can wash dishes in the back because typically the simple and direct information of price per unit is not made explicitly clear.

There are two recent payment models that some people are adopting- which is a fee for the area versus the units. Frankly, this guide won't venture too far regarding the amount of units used to treat the area- so you can do the math and see if it's worth it. Or better yet, find a place which will conduct a free consultation and use that as your baseline for the units you might require.

While not as common, some places are adopting an annual membership type deal. Despite living in LA I haven't encountered this...ever? But it seems to be prevalent in new york.

However, my best advice for cost savings is the route I choose to take. I booked as many available appointments with providers, and when I arrived for my appointment I attempted to get them to date me. As a result I now currently live with a board certified dermatologist who I force to give me the rep samples for free.

I love you people. please come talk to me. I wanna hear your feedback, thoughts, suggestions, interests, fav thong brand (mine is amazon). And I am happy to provide anyone with a consultation regarding questions of concerns they have about their face.

k. love you. bye.

# OH interesting-ish update from the world of modern aesthetics 

Literally just today, I was reading the post recent publication modernaesthetics [https://modernaesthetics.com](https://modernaesthetics.com) and came across the article [Here](https://modernaesthetics.com/articles/2024-may-june/navaclick-injection-system?c4src=search:feed)

The article in Modern Aesthetics discusses the Navaclick Injection System, a device designed to improve the delivery of injectable treatments in aesthetic procedures. Basically they are creating needles specifically for neurotoxin injections, which aim to enhance precision and control. 

How did they do this? The Navaclick system can be operated with one hand allowing one to maintain better control over the injection process while freeing up their other hand for other tasks, adjustments, tweeting. More importantly, freeing up the injectors attention to be placed on the facial mapping and anatomy of the patient versus the stupid fucking dosage. 

Each, “click” provides a measured 0.2ml of solution per injection. Which, if you have ever tried to watch a tiny plunger move 1 or 2 mm out of the corner of your eye, while making sure you don’t blind Malibu Barbie- it can be hard. It's not impossible- but if you ask any injector, most of them have done this so many times that they learn to ""feel"" for what its like to inject 0.2ml of a solution based on the gauge of the needle, the viscosity of the solution and the sandpaper grit of your skin.

It's art. I've only truly come to appreciate it as a medical student as I have become better at obtaining diagnostic information solely through tactile senses and touch. I mean arguable- I could actually inject your botox blindfolded (after a visual inspection) because its based on muscle movement- which is felt, not always seen.

But that's fucking insane. And no matter how good of an artist you are- it doesn't exclude this being science, not the MoMa. Providers, no matter what, want precision. Precision not only ensures that every point on your forehead is equally dosed- but if you come back with the left one spocking. We can confidently assume its cus the left is stronger than the right, versus accidentally adding 1-2 units more while we were fantasizing about being a stay at home girlfriend. Fucking massive. Massively valuable to rule out a differential diagnosis because of something as simple as this.

It's almost crazy to think about the way we do it now- when you consider this.

The other enticing aspect is the formulation- which comes pre reconstituted. As you will read below, botox comes in powdered form that requires a solution of saline to be added before it can be injected. Which I mean, seems easy enough right? Well.

One I’m becoming resistant (it only lasts about one month vs. 2 when I first started) before movement comes back and the amount of movement coming back is worse too. I’m seriously considering taking a year off and reassessing at that point.

Two, I think I might be developing accessory muscle lines. Because the muscles seem to be more noticeable in other areas above my brow now.

1dlhf5j,Esthetics,Am I the only one concerned about BioSkin Aesthetics Products and Owner…BioRePeel results?,"Hi everyone,

I’m reaching out to see if anyone else has had a similar experience with BioSkin Aesthetics products. I started using their BioRePeel line on my clients, but unfortunately, I haven’t seen the results that were advertised. This has not only been disappointing for me but also for my clients who trust me to provide them with effective treatments.

Out of concern, I decided to do a bit more research into the company and its background. To my shock, I discovered that David Burke, the owner of BioSkin Aesthetics, has a criminal record. He was convicted of selling fake Botox and fillers in the past and has even served time in jail for these offenses.

This revelation has me extremely worried about the safety and efficacy of the products I’ve been using. I feel responsible for ensuring the best care for my clients and now I’m questioning the integrity of BioSkin Aesthetics’ offerings.

Has anyone else used BioSkin Aesthetics products and noticed a lack of results? Or does anyone have more information about David Burke and his past? I’m concerned that I may have put my clients at risk and would appreciate any insights or shared experiences.

Thank you all in advance for your help.

1c35kgv,30PlusSkinCare,For anyone who gets or is considering getting Botox…,"TLDR: You can develop antibodies to botulinum toxin. If you get Botox but find it’s not working well anymore, antibodies could be the cause. If you develop antibodies it takes 4-5 years for them to clear. During that time if you want or need Botox for anything it will be ineffective. If you haven’t had Botox, make sure you find a good injector and understand that this could be a potential outcome.

______

There has been a lot of discussion around Botox. Everyone has their opinions on it, but for those who currently get it or are considering getting it for the first time, I just wanted to share some info that I didn’t know previously, and haven’t seen discussed very much at all. I also want to state that I’m not a doctor, and I’m totally ready to be schooled in whatever is wrong here, I’m just sharing my experience and what I’ve learned from my own research.

*Botox antibodies/immunogenicity*

I am late 30s and got Botox for the first time 6 months ago. I was super nervous but quickly fell in love once those first shots took effect! Seriously, it was a lightbulb moment - like no wonder why it’s far and away the most common cosmetic procedure. My provider is freaking awesome, I did so much research on everything for so long before I ever pulled the trigger. That’s why I was extra shocked that I never knew you could develop antibodies to the botulinum toxin itself! Right after two injections, I got sick (not from the toxin, my partner and I caught a virus or something). I’m pretty sure that my body fighting whatever bug I caught, at basically the same time that this toxin was setting in, aided in me developing antibodies to Botox since my immune system was already in hyperdrive. 

Apparently, this can happen, and it’s more likely and more common with any of the toxins that are attached to something else as a delivery mechanism - Botox, Dysport, and Jeuveau are all attached to some proteins, Daxxify to some peptide, but the only one that’s “pure” is Xeomin. I was kind of shocked to hear this since I haven’t heard much about Xeomin except that people who have had it seem to be happy with it. I’m now feeling like this is probably why.

From what I’ve read, your body is far, far, less likely to develop antibodies to the pure toxin than it is when it’s attached to a protein or peptide, because your system more readily recognizes a protein or peptide as a foreign invader than it does pure botulinum toxin.  So it starts fighting off that protein or peptide, and then sees “oh this thing is here too, we’ll take care of that”, and boom you’ve got botulinum toxin-A antibodies. 

Once you’ve got these antibodies there’s little you can do except wait 4-5 years if you want to get Botox again. That’s about how long it takes for the antibodies to clear from your system. My doctor says that there is the *potential* to try botulinum toxin-B (Myoblok), but it would be off-label use, and it’s expensive since no one really uses it for cosmetic reasons. There’s also the potential that:
1. It won’t work at all because it’s similar to Botox
2. If it works for a bit and then you still end up developing antibodies to it, now you have rendered a potential medical treatment (should you ever need it), completely ineffective and useless. 

Basically I just wanted to share my experience with this, and create a space for discussion around this potential “complication” or outcome of the procedure. I know I’ve seen plenty of people talk about how Botox became less and less effective for them, and I feel like this has to be at least in part why. But I wonder how many of them ever knew that it *could* be because they have developed antibodies to it. Again, I’m not a doctor, just sharing what I’ve learned, but I am super interested to learn new things that I may not have known. So, if you are a doctor, or anyone which more info in this realm, please chime in!

Also, getting sick around your injections isn’t the only potential way to develop antibodies. It’s also more likely if your injector uses too much or too little toxin, which is yet another reason why it’s so important to do your research and find an experienced and knowledgeable injector.",2024-04-13 16:14:07+00:00,315,164

1c0jvsp,u_DrChaileeMossGYN,"Pelvic floor botulinum toxin (brand names: botox, jeuveau, dysport)","I wanted to post a little bit about botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) because I had a patient yesterday who wanted to know more about it.  I use this medicine on a fairly regular basis for patients with significant pelvic floor muscle dysfunction, and I think there are some misconceptions that it is somehow related to vulvovaginal appearance.  This is not cosmetic gynecology!  BoNT is an amazing tool so I wanted to give people some background that may be helpful.

BoNT is the product of clostridium botulinum, a bacteria.  Adults are usually affected by toxin in spoiled canned food; babies can ingest bacteria spores from honey (their immune systems are not mature enough to avoid this, whereas adults usually can - this is why honey for kids <2yo is an absolute no-no).  

While large ingested amounts of the toxin are harmful, it turns out that very dilute toxin can be used on specific muscles to relax them.  Tightly contracted muscles of the pelvic floor can make sex painful, make people feel the constant need to urinate, and cause constipation among other problems.  Relaxing those muscles using BoNT can substantially improve patient comfort and sexual function.  The downside is it's not an FDA approved medication; it's used off-label (but lots of things are not yet labeled for sexual function!).  It's best to use it in conjunction with pelvic floor physical therapy and treatment of any pain or skin conditions that may be encouraging the muscles to contract, since it's an expensive medication and ideally improving underlying conditions may make it less necessary in the future.

2) I feel way less freezing than when I’ve had it done professionally (always had jeuveau) and he feels no freezing whatsoever after 2 days.  Ordered from Fillerhouse, on ice, freezer after. We mapped our faces like we had professionally.

I’m thinking to open my own business in the near future, but also would like to expand my services beyond just facial treatments. I think there are two options are realistic to me, but both take time and dedications. So, before making the decisions, I would like to hear what other fellow estis think about it.

First option, getting a nursing license. We all know clients should wait at least 2 weeks to get a facial after their Botox or fillers. If I have both nursing and esthetician licenses, I could do both in the same visit. Or facial with laser hair removal?! 
Second option, getting a massage license. I would like to focus on therapeutic massages, like deep tissue, acupressure, shiatsu, cupping therapy, and gua sha. I guess I could target different group of clientele working as a massage therapist? Since facial and Botox clientele are more likely the same? Like those who pay more attentions to how their face looks. 

Since I’ve already received my bachelor degree, for accelerated BSN program, it takes about 12-15 months to complete. And for a massage program that covers both western and eastern techniques, it takes about 8-9 months. 

I genuinely want to hear other estis’ opinions and experience about this. Thank you!",2024-03-03 00:29:26+00:00,3,4

This trend could drive the demand for products like Botox, which reduces wrinkles and offers a more youthful appearance.

Jeuveau (PrabotulinumtoxinA) is a prescription injection used to temporarily improve the appearance of moderate to severe frown lines between the eyebrows (glabellar lines) in adults. It is made from a purified form of botulinum toxin type A, which works by blocking the release of acetylcholine, a chemical messenger that causes muscles to contract. This helps to relax the muscles that cause frown lines, resulting in a smoother appearance.

Jeuveau is typically injected into the glabellar area 3-4 times a year. The effects of the injection usually last for 3-4 months. Common side effects of Jeuveau include headache, injection site pain, bruising, and swelling.

17a47s1,Esthetics,Depressy Esthi,"I've responded to some posts on here encouraging estheticians to keep going and follow their dreams! However, at what point do you throw your hands up and say, I'm fuckin done!? I stopped practicing esthetics a while ago because of the limited spas in my area, now, within 5 years, the area is saturated with them. Between lash and nail salons, medi spas and everything else, the competition is insane. Nothing wrong with competition,  but for the love of God there's 5 spas within a 2 square mile radius of me. 

Regardless, I got back into the game in 2021, went back to EWC just to get my feet wet again, and left because of the toxic environment. Now I'm the only esthetician at a salon with an employer who confessed to me she hasn't cared about her business, and who's salon is above the spa room. You can hear everything. The loud cracks of the wood floor, the blow dryers etc. Im bringing in clients the bedt i can, im still learning how to use social media. ... but I can't force this woman to spend money on marketing or to buy floor padding... I'm not in control. I'm in debt up my ass, and I'm just fuckin mad. I'm seething actually, and I just needed to say it. 


I have no money to go out on my own, and I do not have a degree. I live 90 minutes from NYC, but they pay to commute is horrendous. How do you guys hang on and keep going? I'm never one to give up, but this is why I quit esthetics years ago, and I'm 32, at one point am I going to thrive for fucks sake. Sorry, just had to let it out.

**** also, I'm really pissed off at RNs and other medical workers stomping their way into this industry as well. You're telling me someone who isn't allowed to draw blood can give botox!?!?!? I have never wanted to be a nurse, hence why I never went to school, but some of the best treatments such as microneedling etc. I'm now not allowed to do unless I'm a nurse.... fuck hahaha",2023-10-17 17:51:21+00:00,32,33

15mf61r,Esthetics,"Need advice on going solo, is starting in a new city too risky?","Hi! I’m looking for some guidance. I’ve been working at a med spa for a while now and I feel it’s time for me to go solo. I don’t have much money to start off with so the usual treatments I perform I wouldn’t be able to do until I make enough profit to purchase those machines in the future (laser hair removal, hydrafacial, oxygeneo) 

I’ve been looking at studios and came across one that was beautiful. It’s a nurse/medical directors med spa where she offers fillers Botox prp etc another person is renting one of the rooms doing lashes I’d be in the third room doing facials and laser eventually. She’s offered to be my medical director for an affordable price. The only thing is it’s $1000 a month and a hour drive in a whole other city.

My family told me it isn’t wise because all my clients are where I live but I think all of my clients would be expecting hydrafacials or oxygeno which I just can’t afford right now. Plus I don’t think they’d change spas I think they like the convenience of the med spa I work at plus it’s the best in our city so best bet is they’ll just switch to another esthetician that works there. There’s a couple other studios I’ve looked at that are closer to me for $800 which is more my price range but I also feel like collaborating with someone who does Botox and fillers would be beneficial for me and might bring in more clientele.

I’m in Canada so I don’t really need a medical director for much except for ordering certain chemical peels.. my main thing is I think partnering with a nurse could bring in more clientele rather than just being alone.

What do you guys think? Should I go with the further studio in another city or just stick close to home. Thanks in advance!!!",2023-08-09 13:21:10+00:00,2,6

13try5u,30PlusSkinCare,ADVICE: Wrinkles & Feeling Like Still Frowning After 1st Time Botox (Jeuveau),"Hey everyone!!! 

So I just turned 30 a little while ago & finally decided to get Botox for the first time in my forehead 2 weeks ago. My doctor injected me with Jeuveau - she said that's her preferred type & she loves the results better for her patients (and herself). Anyway, since I'm completely new to this experience, my forehead definitely felt weird for a while, like a sort of ""heaviness"" feeling. As the days have been going on, I've been feeling this sort of ""push and pull"" with the muscles in my forehead. My forehead itself, like when it comes to raising my brows and forehead, I can't do that anymore, those muscles are definitely relaxed, but I've still been having this ""frowning"" feeling between my brows - like they don't feel relaxed at all, and I've been noticing this 1 frown line that I've had before by my brow still there. 

Full disclosure - before the injections, I've never been able to frown on demand, it kind of has always happened involuntarily, like when I'm really mad or in front of a computer/phone screen, and I'll feel the muscles and realize I've been frowning. As a result, there has been this 1 frown line that I've mentioned that has been slowly creeping onto my skin - it's definitely a fine line, not crazy deep, but it is noticeable to a degree (obviously with certain lightings it's even worse). 

That all being said, I had my 2 week follow-up appointment with the doctor yesterday. I was honestly fully convinced that I'd need a touch up, but when she and her assistant saw me they both said everything looks amazing. I told her all my concerns though, everything that I mentioned above & how the muscles between my brows still don't feel relaxed, because I honestly was expecting her to say the opposite and to see what I've been talking about, but she showed me before and afters and she said there's no line there & she tried getting me to frown and she said I wasn't doing it. She's the real deal, because she said that if I wanted to ""blow my money"" that she would do a touch up for me, but again, she said it would be a waste because there's nothing there to be ""touched up"" even. 

I mean, ngl, I am kind of disappointed because I still see the frown line there, not to mention the muscles by my brows still feel the same as before, so I'm completely confused why she didn't see it. Like, she's a doc, and it would benefit her $$$ wise if she recommended I get a touch up, but I guess she was being real with me, which I love about her, but at the same time I am still disappointed about the line. She said she didn't see a line & the ""Frowning"" feeling/unrelaxed brow feeling that I mentioned is actually normal for 1st time patients (something about how my brain is trying to frown, so that feeling is there, but the tox is preventing it from actually happening on my face?) & the next time I get the injections I'll be used to it by then & won't feel that sensation anymore. 

I'm kind of at a loss about what to do. I've been seriously debating about going to see another injector but Idk if that would be a waste. I mean, my doctor has no reason to lie like that to me, right? If she wanted to scam me for more cash, she could have easily injected me more. I feel like I'm just being paranoid & hard on myself as usual, but I promise there's still a frown line there. Sometimes it's visible and other times it isn't. I examined my face yesterday when I got home from the appointment & I didn't see it there, but tonight I just did. I'm so annoyed! I know these injections don't ""erase"" the wrinkles, they just relax the muscles and since you're not moving those parts of your face anymore, the lines in those areas soften up & depending on the kind of wrinkle they are, they become less visible as time goes on. So now I'm thinking, maybe I just have to give it time? The doctor did say that the injections are already kicked in, too, so there's no more waiting regarding my muscle movement. 

I don't know, I'm just feeling a bit at a loss about this & could really use some advice from others who have done this - or if anyone else has experienced the same thing? Because I just don't know what to do right now. Seek out another injector or give it some time? 

Thank you everyone Xx",2023-05-28 05:03:53+00:00,2,2

112fo9x,Esthetics,Becoming an esthetician,"
I’ve done many google searches, but I wanted to reach out here and see if I could get some feedback. I’ve been a nurse for 5 years now and I’m looking at moving into aesthetics. I’ve only been an ER nurse, so no current experience in plastics or derm. I’m wondering if I should look into completing the 750 hour esthetician course to become a licensed esthetician. Most job postings I’ve seen in my area are looking for experienced nurse injectors or NP’s with experience as well. My goal is to do facials, focus on skin care, but I’d be interested in microneedling, laser hair removal, etc. and maybe eventually Botox/fillers, but that is not my top priority. I see plenty of job postings looking for licensed Estheticians, so that’s why I’m thinking of completing the course. I figured that certification plus being a registered nurse would help me advance in this area. Thanks for any responses!",2023-02-14 20:45:44+00:00,9,7

10grn7h,Esthetics,If you’re unhappy quit that job!!,"Sharing my experience I’m a recent graduate so once I finished school I was willing to work anywhere to get into the field.

My first job out of school was $18/hr as a med spa receptionist I told her I recently graduated and was looking to actually be hired as an esthetician she said she wanted to wait it out since I was so new, which was understandable. She had me cold calling random numbers asking if they wanted a facial or Botox but failed to mention she already called these numbers multiple times so I was basically harassing these people and being yelled and cursed at. after being over worked and micromanaged with the empty promise to soon take in clients, seeing how she treated other estis, how much they disliked being there and many other red flags I left immediately.

Second job was $20/hr and I was actually taking in clients. I was hired with promise to be an esthetician doing all services but was only ever booked for laser hair removal id mention the fact that I was fully trained for everything and my boss would brush me off, she actually once just straight up said “I don’t care” other estis that worked there said she also stuck them on to one service which within the past years made them become insecure about doing the other services they were trained to provide, they no longer felt confident. She’d yell at employees AND clients. She would threaten us with taking money out of our pay, micromanaged and said if I quit or she fired me I’d have to pay her $3k for training I already received at school. Commission was 10% but she made it impossible to sell she’d take over the conversation and make the sale herself. Tips were nothing I’d get $5 a week if I was lucky.

Third (current) job $20/hr I’m doing everything I was trained for and more. They’re teaching me electrolysis thermo-coagulation and tattoo removal. I’ve been there a month and already have returning clients and people requesting me. Commission is only 5% (wish it was more) I usually sell facial packages which averages at $600 so I only make about  $30 on that which sucks but hey it’s better than nothing. I make a lot more tips than I did at my previous job not a lot but it brings my average pay up to about $25-$30 an hour. So far I’m happy with this job but if something better comes along I’ll definitely take it. I’m planning/saving up to work for myself one day.
 
Although it feels like forever this all happened within the past 5 months. If I had stayed at my first or even second job right now I’d be so unhappy and making less than I am right now I’m still definitely not where I want to be but I’m slowly moving up. Ive always felt so anxious and guilty about leaving a job but If you’re unhappy, if your boss is toxic and you feel like you’re not getting what you deserve PLEASE leave.

y4xyla,30PlusSkinCare,Got 40 units of Jeuveau yesterday,"I haven’t seen a lot of Jeuveau posts so just want to kinda put my my experience out there. 

I chose Jeuveau over Botox because I was advised by the nurse that it was same formula, she likes the results better and it was $2 a unit cheaper. There was also a promo for $40 off. I got 40 units for $360. 

This is my first time with any injectables but I have had some lines on my forehead that have been getting progressively deeper for the last two years and I finally decided to do something about. I also got my frown lines done. It was suggested to do crows feet but I opted out because I don’t think mine are that bad. 

Been about 22 hours and I can already see and feel results. I feel fine - one sight did bruise so that’s pretty tender. I have a slight headache but think that’s probably from the bruise. Forehead feels a little heavy but I have read that’s just side effect from any injectable. My stomach was a little upset though, not sure if that’s just nerves.

Jeuveau and Botox have a few similarities, especially in their application. Both FDA-approved neuromodulators made from botulinum toxin type A. Jeuveau and Botox are useful in correcting and enhancing facial lines and wrinkles.

I have had Botox and Dysport begore (4 times) and had minor dull headaches but nothing crazy. 

I had Jeuveau (aka newtox ) 4 months ago and went back today. 4 months ago headache was very minor but today it is probably the most excruciating headache I’ve ever had in my life. Same amount of units (50) but this time I had a diff Nurse Practitioner and I had a brow lift which I had never done before.

I have thrown up twice, took prescription medicine and it’s just getting worse. It was almost 9 hours ago.

Could this be an allergic reaction? What should I do? It’s like absolutely excruciating…

vgw10w,Esthetics,Plasma pen,"Plasma fibroblast gone wrong

So I [25F] got plasma done on my forehead and under eyes/cheeks 8 weeks ago. Now I have textured skin also known as dermal pits all over the areas that were done. As much sunscreen as I use & hats I wear to block the Sun, parts of my skin have started to also become pigmented on top of the texture. 

I was told it was an alternative to Botox. My friend from aesthetician school talked me into doing it telling me how Botox is just injecting toxins into my body. When I looked into the fibroblast I was only seeing the good parts, the amazing results. I felt compelled to do it only because I was freaked out about the toxins in Botox. I feel really stupid & regret getting this procedure done. I can’t stop worrying or crying about it. 

My friend told me I could get it sprayed instead of dotting with the plasma pen to help with the texture but I am too traumatized to have that thing touch my face again.

I’m wondering if anyone out there has had the same effects & also if you had any recommendations. I’m wanting to wait till after summer to possibly try microneedling to help. I’ve been putting lots of vitamin E oil in hopes to help, wearing lots of sunscreens, hats. Any advice is tremendously appreciated!! Nice comments only please!

skm0oc,Esthetics,Looking into starting esthetician school. Any advice welcome!,"Hello all! I am interested in going back to school to become an esthetician. I’m 25, female, and graduated from college with a communication degree. I live in North Carolina in a fairly small-but big city. My first question is, is it worth it to go to Aveda or to a smaller local school? Is there is big difference between “medical” esthetician vs standard esthetician? Who makes more? I’m not quite sure which path I want to take once I am certified. I’m debating between the lash/brow specialist or doing something more medical, like laser and potentially advancing to Botox/filler. I know estheticians are all for skin care, but the one thing I don’t want to make a career in is extractions. I’m sorry, but those pimple popping videos creep me out. I understand I will have to learn these things in class, but it’s not the route I want to take. After I’m done with school, is it best to work for someone else or try to start my own thing? What is the best transition for someone coming right out of school who wants to make a successful career out of esthetics? I currently work a nightly bar job Wednesday- Saturday, so I will still continue to do this on the side until I make enough to support myself living in the city (which isn’t cheap).

Any suggestions, tips, advice, or experience will be greatly appreciated! Also, are there any classes that are strictly online?

She only takes cash or check which is fine but I’m wondering how much I should ask for since I’m so new (commission wise).

po8zbn,30PlusSkinCare,I got my first filler today!,"I am 38. I have noticed for a while that my face looks different than in my 20's but can't exactly pin down what is different. (Less full maybe?!)  I do see wrinkles (or crinkles) around my eyes when I smile and lines on my forehead when I raise my eyebrows. I have also started getting that famous '11' between my eyebrows.

I have never been against fillers but always thought they were too expensive. I heard awhile ago that Botox was now 'only a few hundred dollars'. I, of course, could think of a lot of other things to spend $300-$400  on and have continued to talk myself out of getting anything. However, I keep staring at those lines around my eyes. I finally decided to go for it. If it raises my self-confidence a bit then it is worth it to me. 

 I went in thinking I would get Botox but really was fine with whatever they recommended. I ended up getting Jeuveau.  They said it is also called Newtox and said it was the Millennial Botox haha. Since I am an elder Millennial this seemed very fitting.  They said they like to be conservative with the injections when it is someone's first time and I think I received 16 total units.  My total cost was way cheaper than I thought it would be (Under $250). We did the areas above/between my eyebrows and outside of my eyes. A few of them pinched a bit but as far as pain goes- it hurts worse when I stub my toe. Between my consultation and the injections,  I was in the office for less than 45 minutes. I have an appointment in two weeks to finish my forehead wrinkles.  

So far, I am super excited and happy with my entire experience. I will update in a week or so and report on my results.  I'm just posting here to let anyone considering fillers know how mine went. Also, because I am not telling very many people in my life and need to share with someone! : )

Edited to add: Apparently I did not get filler at all and so parts of my post are wrong. I got injections but they were not filler. Learn something new everyday!",2021-09-14 18:50:18+00:00,221,88
o038h5,Esthetics,"Microneedling & Spectra Peel Horror Story, Help","Hi everyone, it all starts with 2/24/21 when I got my first microneedling treatment (only .02 on forehead and .06 mm deep on chin). It was FANTASTIC, the results were amazing 8 days after, I was radiating with a smooth new complexion especially on my expression lines. However, the day after, it was a Saturday and I got drunk. I will never forget this day. I was drunk and got into an argument where I FORCIBLY frowned at the person (it took effort and energy to even make my tight skin express that face). I didn't notice it right away, but the day after, I noticed I had... possibly traumatized/permanently scarred/permanently etched a frown into my face along with an indentation running all the way up to my hairline that I know is from making that face. I had JUST completely smoothed out those lines with this treatment... butI really tried to ignore it and prayed that it would go back to the way it was, I'm fearing it won't. 

On 4/1/21 I then saw a dermatologist who didn't even look at it as i expressed my concerns and followed through with a spectra peel. It really didn't help much, in fact, I think it may have scientifically made it more difficult to repair whatever I just did. I further expressed my concerns to both the med spa and the dermatology clinic, but no one seems to take it serious. 

I tried to ignore it and I tried to logically think, maybe another microneedling treatment will undo what I had just created. So on 5/13, I got my second treatment. That's when i recognized there was something majorly wrong. While I was healing, I felt serious tension where the indentations/new frown lines were, and it looked really really scary during the healing process. I've never had a ""resting bitch face,"" but I guess I created one now. 

I recently (6/10) went back to the dermatologist and she didn't really explain much and just kept pushing for Botox, so I let her inject 12 units, which has helped just the slightest bit. Some of the tension has released but definitely not entirely. It feels like I'm just constantly putting a bandaid over a gushing wound. 

I'm sorry for this long long essay but I'm dying for an answer, for a cure, for a complete reset back to that 8th day after my first microneedling treatment where it I had no anger lines.. Are there any remedies? Is there any outlook? I know it's so unheard of, I'm probably the only one that has ever sabotaged their own treatment and face like this, so I've turned to reddit for answers. :(",2021-06-15 02:16:05+00:00,1,3
lzhuk1,Esthetics,Let’s talk client/patient charting & record keeping (LONG),"Esthies, although the article below is primarily directed at Med spas, I cannot stress enough the importance of maintaining good records. There are multiple reasons for doing so. The main reasons are for everyone’s safety and in the event you ever get sued. You should ALWAYS have current contact information, updated health/medications/allergies records. Allergies can happen at any time… Even if someone is not allergic to say a particular lash glue, they can develop an allergic reaction at any time down the road. Always ask if they are using anything you aren’t aware of (retinol, had injectables, using or recently treated with acids, BP use, etc.). If you’re performing certain therapies like laser, MC, RF, ultrasound, you need to know if they have dental appliances, implants, removable prosthetics and the like. I was in dentistry for 20 years... believe me, it can matter. You keep records PRIVATE just as you would HIPAA regulated documents. This means you do not share info with your bestie, spouse, significant other, etc. The same applies to photos. In order to show them outside of the confines of your practice, for any reason, you need a signed release from the client/patient. Although you don’t need a diatribe of notes, keep an UPDATED record of products, treatments and devices used, reactions if any. Note anything unusual (you wax their brows all the time, but this visit you lifted skin), or, (“client had a headache after MC”, had a rash, weird growth [location], you advised them to see a derm, etc.). It doesn’t hurt to keep a record of samples you give them. Most POS credit card processing systems keep itemized product sales. If your POS only states a generic facial, note any customization or changes. This is just a broad overview. Things vary practice to practice. 

One more thing... accuracy, grammar, correct spelling, proper punctuation/measurements & numbers/dates (3% acid or pH of 3, or was it 3 layers, or 3 minutes of processing). Or worse “crap, did I neutralize that peel?”. Write out abbreviations if they can be confused with something else. Nothing looks worse, unprofessional, and incompetent when there is slang, run-on sentences, improper punctuation or lack thereof. Sign and date all entries. Remember, one day, maybe only one slip-up... and these records might be given to a doctor, lawyer, or judge. Protect yourself. 


By Alex R. Thiersch, JD, CEO of the American Med Spa Association (AmSpa)

Medical aesthetic practices and medical spas are medical facilities, so they are subject to the rules and regulations that govern more conventional medical practices, such as doctor’s offices and hospitals. Among these is the requirement to keep detailed medical records for all patients. And although it might not necessarily seem crucial for a medical spa employee to record every interaction with every person seeking a Botox injection, meticulous charting can be a practice’s best defense against unwarranted legal action and unforeseen complications. Read on for a quick primer about what should be expected of patient charting in a medical aesthetics environment.

Charting Basics
A properly maintained medical chart should contain the full story of each patient encounter—who the patient is, why he or she came in, what the diagnosis was, and what the plan of care is. It is critical to ensuring continuity in patient care.

“Professionals need to open up that medical record and be able to discern all the relevant information that they’re going to need in order to make an informed decision as to the course of treatment for whatever the patient approached them for,” explains Jay D. Reyero, partner with national medical aesthetics law firm ByrdAdatto.

Many state medical boards have rules that dictate what an adequate medical record should contain and, while there may be some differences in minutiae from state to state, these guidelines tend to include certain items—the patient’s history, identifying information, the diagnosis, supporting documentation, signed consent, any prescriptions given, and any referrals or consultations provided. In addition, many medical practices have their own statutory requirements for patient charts; reviewing some of these can also provide an idea of what a well-maintained medical record should contain.

At the end of the day, a patient chart will likely reflect the administering physician’s professional medical judgment. If he or she deems the information relevant, it will be added to the record. However, certain common omissions make charts significantly less useful, from both legal and patient care perspectives.

Coming Up Short
The lack of documentation of informed consent is one of the primary shortcomings in many medical records. Generally speaking, physicians need to show that they have followed the standard of care by fully informing a patient about the risks and potential complications of the course of action they are recommending.

“It [documentation of informed consent] is critical to defend yourself,” Reyero says. “Whether it’s malpractice litigation or a medical board complaint issue, those are the most important documents that you’re going to want to have to show that you advised the patient, as much as possible, as to what they were going to do, and that they actually consented to the procedure being performed.”

Additionally, lack of supporting documentation for diagnoses or treatments administered can impact reimbursement, since the physician cannot corroborate the codes that are being billed to the insurance providers.

Many physicians and mid-level practitioners also fail to properly document their supervision and oversight over non-licensed professionals to whom they have delegated treatments. This information demonstrates that the proper steps have been taken for all procedures that have been performed, and the lack of it can be a major red flag if something happens to go wrong with a treatment.

For more guidelines regarding what legally needs to appear on patient charts in your state, consult an experienced local healthcare attorney.

For Your Eyes Only
In medical aesthetic practices, it is typical that both licensed medical and non-medical personnel work with patients. However, due to the privacy protection required by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), some of the information on patient charts must be withheld from the non-medical personnel at the practice.

“HIPAA generally allows workforce members who are employees of the entity [medical aesthetics practice] to have access to patient records, although the entity does have to have proper policies and procedures in place to limit the amount of information accessible by those individuals to what’s known as the minimum necessary,” Reyero says. “Essentially, employees should only have access to information that is necessary to do their job or practices can be exposed to risk. Improper access by employees to information that they don’t otherwise need access to can give rise to HIPAA breach issues. You see that a lot with the celebrity HIPAA breaches, where employees who have no relation to the treatment or care given to a celebrity access their information, and the hospital or facility didn’t have the proper policies or procedures in place to prevent that from occurring.”

State laws regulating patient privacy may be even more stringent than HIPAA, so it is important for medical aesthetic practices and medical spas to establish policies and procedures to prevent employees from accessing information that they do not need. If a practice is using electronic medical records (EMRs), the system can typically restrict access to certain information for users who do not have authorization to view it. If you do not know if your system includes such features (or if you do not know how to use them), consult your EMR vendor to learn how to set them up using your information technology infrastructure.

If your practice does not use an EMR system, it is critical to establish strong internal procedures and the proper training of employees to make sure that everyone is aware of the roles and responsibilities of everyone involved. The practice must also continually update and assess the risks of employees improperly accessing confidential medical records, and it must implement appropriate safeguards in order to prevent that access.

Regardless of the system being used, the practice must hold employees who improperly access confidential medical information accountable. HIPAA and state patient privacy violations can alter a medical aesthetic practice forever, so it is critical that they be prevented at all costs.

Closing the Communication Gap
The issue of maintaining communication about a patient’s history goes beyond HIPAA, however—it is about doing what is right for the patient. So how should medical and non-medical personnel, both inside and outside a medical aesthetic practice, maintain meaningful communication regarding a patient’s history? The best way to do this is to have very clear policies and procedures regarding the tracking and documentation of information within patient medical records, so that the next time a provider has access to that information, it is clear what courses of treatment were offered or accepted following a consultation with a physician.

“Having a very clear set of initial questions, whether that’s on the initial patient examination when it’s their first time at your practice or a set of follow-up questions when it’s a follow-up appointment, can address some of those concerns and find out if the patient has undergone any procedures recently. Have they taken any supplements? Have they received any injections? Those sorts of questions that can determine a different set of care that you’re going to have to give,” Reyero explains. “It’s communicating with the patient up front, making that part of your process of intake with the new patient or the follow-up patient, and then making sure that you cover all your bases. The goal is to get them to talk to you about what they’ve been doing or if they’ve had any changes in their medical history since they last visited you.”

Policies and procedures for patient charting should be developed internally by licensed medical professionals who are familiar with using and maintaining informative medical records. Then these charting guidelines can be incorporated into the environment of the medical aesthetic practice or medical spa.

“Training can take the form of a lunch meeting where everyone is going over what the policies and procedures are and asking questions, or online questionnaires where you print out a certificate at the end of the test, or one-on-one training where you sit down with the individual and you walk through their daily routine and make sure that everything that they’re doing is in line with the policies and procedures in place,” Reyero says. “You can customize it to each individual employee’s relevant situation and circumstances, so that when you walk through their daily routine, you’re being sure that you’re talking about the policies and educating them about the policies that will impact them on a daily basis, and not overwhelm them with 20 different policies when maybe only two are applicable.”

Writing the Story
Those who create and maintain medical records have a duty to make sure that the information on a patient’s medical chart is complete and accurate, so that there is no potential for the disruption of care that might be given in the future. A physician who opens up that document should feel like he or she has all the information needed to make an informed decision. A medical record should tell a patient’s entire story, because ultimately a physician’s job is to make sure that story continues.",2021-03-07 03:10:58+00:00,11,4

i1egje,u_Aleksys_Stuart,Botox,"Botox injections are probably best known for reducing skin wrinkles. Botox can also help treat crossed eyes, eyelid spasms, excessive sweating, and some bladder disorders.

What is Botox?

Botox derives from a bacterium called Clostridium botulinum. This bacterium is present in many natural settings, including soil, lakes, forests, and in the intestinal tracts of mammals and fish.
Naturally occurring Clostridium botulinum bacteria and spores are generally harmless. Problems only arise when the spores transform and the cell population increases. At a certain point, the bacteria begin producing botulinum toxin, the deadly neurotoxin responsible for botulism.
Botulinum toxin is extremely toxic. In fact, some scientists have estimated that 1 gram (g) of crystalline toxin could kill 1 million people and a couple of kilograms could kill every human on earth.
However, according to the American Osteopathic College of Dermatology, (AOCD), Botox is safe and has few side effects when used in a therapeutic context.


Commercial versions of Botulinum toxin include:
	•	Botox (onabotulinumtoxin A)
	•	Dysport (abobotulinumtoxin A)
	•	Xeomin (incobotulinumtoxin A)
	•	Myobloc (rimabotulinumtoxin B)
	•	Jeuveau (prabotulinumtoxin A)
People use the term Botox interchangeably for these various products, though “Botox” is the registered trademark of Allergan Inc.


How does it work?

Botox is a neurotoxin. These substances target the nervous system, disrupting the nerve signaling processes that stimulate muscle contraction. This is how the drug causes temporary muscle paralysis.
In order for muscles to contract, nerves release a chemical messenger called acetylcholine at the junction where the nerve endings meet muscle cells. Acetylcholine attaches to receptors on the muscle cells and causes the muscle cells to contract or shorten.
Botox injections prevent the release of acetylcholine, which stops muscle cells from contracting. The toxin reduces abnormal muscle contraction, allowing the muscles to become less stiff.

gb6fer,Esthetics,Having major issues with the spa I work at,"I am at a loss in my current workplace.  Like many of you, I am a 1099 employee. I work at a med spa as an esthetician along with the business owner who is an NP.

The entire time I've been at this place I feel like I have been taken advantage of. I am paid off of commission.  My employer gets 60%, pays for the back bar but I am responsible for tools such as needles and scalpels etc.  I am expected to stay at the spa even when I do not have clients, to answer the phones, clean when needed and help out . When the HOURLY receptionist leaves for the day, I stay and answer phones.. I obviously do not get paid hourly. When I have to leave outside of normal business hours I am looked down upon . The owner walks in every morning 10 minutes until we open, does her thing, and leaves. 

I'm responsible for my own laundry . She refuses to buy a washer and dryer so I take the laundry home every night. I do not get compensated.  

About three months ago I had enough. I grew a back bone and I told her I am an independent contractor. I will not stay when I do not have clients. I dont mind hanging out waiting on walk ins but I am not going to be your receptionist for free when you want to send the actual one home. I will not do laundry.  Buy a washer and dryer and I will do mine as I go (plus,  I'm almost positive legally she needs to have them as we draw blood and use injections , but I'm not sure). Anyways, she was pissed at first, but came around and said she understood. I stopped doing laundry, left when I didnt have clients, etc..  we actually had a decent relationship because now I think she respected me. 

Now, she comes to me in preparation for whenever we open, that she is going to start charging me credit card processing fees. I am also now responsible for laundry again.  And, she is planning on running specials but not on botox or anything that she does. So lets say my service is normally $100, she has taken it upon herself to discount the service 80, and I still only get 40% of the 80, not the normal price.

I'm still relatively new in this business so maybe I'm overlooking something.  Am I wrong  ? I am LIVID she wants to charge me her processing fees. I am meeting with her tomorrow to basically tell her no, that why dont I just pay you rent and I pay for all of my back bar and I get 100% of the fees for my services.  I could use some encouragement.  Am I in the wrong ?",2020-04-30 23:01:35+00:00,7,11

بهترین مارک ژل برای خط اخم

## بهترین مارک ژل برای خط اخم

امروزه [**تزریق ژل**](https://rozclinic.com/gel-injection/) برای پر کردن خط اخم با استقبال زیادی در سراسر دنیا روبرو شده است شما می بایست برای تزریق ژل بهترین کلینیک ها و بهترین مارک را برای تزریق انتخاب نمایید زیرا این گونه عمل یا جراحی های زیبایی بسیار مهم هستند.

📷بنابراین لازم به ذکر است که به هنگام تزریق فیلر حتما دقت کافی را در انتخاب [**دکتر تزریق ژل**](https://rozclinic.com/best-doctor-injection-gel/) و کلینیکی که در قصد انجام تزریق ژل را دارید را در نظر بگیرید زیرا هر گونه اشتباه عوارض جبران ناپذیری را به همراه خواهد داشت از همه مهم تر این است که این گونه تزریق ها چون قرار است که در صورت شما انجام شود. کوچکترین مواد بی کیفیت برای شما می تواند عوارض بسیاری داشته باشد.

در واقع سعی کنید برای تزریق ژل از برندهای بی کیفیت و ارزان استفاده نکنید و برای انجام هرگونه عمل های زیبایی از بهترین مارک های موجود در بازار استفاده کنید تا در این صورت بتوانید به بهترین نتیجه دست یابید. ما در این مقاله در رابطه با بهترین ویژگی و بهترین مارک ژل برای خط اخم توضیحات زیادی خواهیم داد. همچنین شما با انواع تزریق ژل آشنا خواهید شد.

### 📷عملکرد بهترین تزریق ژل چگونه است؟

انواع مختلفی از تزریق ژل وجود دارد که مارک های متفاوتی است. این مارک ها شامل Botox, Dysport xeomin, Jeuveau است. اغلب بر این باورند که ژل ها خط اخم را پر می کند اما اینگونه نیست.

عملکرد این ژل ها به این صورت است که با استفاده از سم بوتولینوم اصطلاحا برای فلج کردن یا صاف کردن خط اخم به کار می رود و این امر موجب شود که خط اخمی که باعث پیر به نظر رسیدن این افراد شده است را برطرف می کند.

سم های موجود در ژل باعث شده تا انتقال نیرو از عصب به منطقه گیرنده قطع شود و در نتیجه عضلات نمی توانند منقبض شوند. در تزریق ژل باید همه این عملکرد وجود داشته باشد در غیر این صورت آن ژل مرغوب نیست.

### بهترین مارک ژل برای تزریق فیلر چیست؟

برندهای مختلفی برای تزریق ژل در کلینیک های زیبایی وجود دارد. یکی از جدیدترین و بهترین آن ها Jeuveau است که در سازمان های مختلفی کیفیت آن تایید شده است. این ژل برای خطوط اخم متوسط به بالا توصیه می شود و باعث شده که این خطوط عمیق اخم را از بین ببرد.

این مارک ژل با این وجود که جدید است اما پزشکان و متخصصان در رابطه با آن به جهت تزریق فیلر خوشبین هستند زیرا افراد زیادی این ژل را استفاده کردند و از نتایج آن تا مدت های طولانی راضی بودند.

اما گاهی اوقات افرادی هستند که پس از استفاده های متعدد از ژل، آن نتایج قبلی را با کیفیت گذشته تجربه نمی کنند این به معنی است که کیفیت ژل پایین بوده و باید به دنبال ژل با کیفیت تری باشند.

بعد از گذشت زمان کسی که بارها از تزریق ژل با این مارک استفاده می کنند بعد از مدت زمانی آن قسمت که در آن ها ژل تزریق شده در برابر آن مقاومت نشان می دهد و دیگر تاثیر گذشته را برای آنها نخواهد داشت.

### تزریق ژل بر پایه آب

پوست صورت به دلایل مختلفی دچار چین و چروک می شوند و بسته به نوع و جنس پوست آنها تزریق ژل انجام می شود. بسیار از پوست ها وجود دارد که به دلیل کمبود رطوبت و آب باعث ایجاد خطوط اخم در صورت می شوند. ژل هایی در این خصوص وجود دارند که بهترین نوع ژل برای این گونه خطوط هستند.

بیشتر پوست ها این گونه تزریق ژل را تحمل می کند و برای آن ها بهترین تاثیرات را دارد. این گونه ژل ها معمولا برای پوست هایی که چرب و مستعد به آکنه هستند بسیار موثرتر هستند.

اگر خطوط شما عمیق و زیاد باشد نیازی به تزریق این گونه ژل ها نخواهد بود. می توانید از کرم هایی که آبرسان هستند برای رفع این خطوط به صورت روزانه مصرف کنید.

### بهترین مارک ژل برای پر کردن خطوط تا چه مدت بر روی پوست صورت باقی می ماند؟

برای تزریق فیلر باید بهترین آن را برای خود انتخاب کنید زیرا این تزریقات در صورت انجام می شود و از حساسیت بالایی برخوردار است همچنین انتخاب بهترین نوع در ماندگاری در صورت تاثیر خواهد گذاشت.

زمانی که شما بهترین تزریق ژل را انجام می دهید باید به مدت 12 تا 18 ماه اثرات آن باقی بماند و در صورت نیاز مجددا تزریق ژل را انجام دهید. در غیر این صورت تزریق ژلی که انجام داده اید از کیفیت بالایی برخوردار نیست.

نوع دیگر از تزریق ها وجود دارند که از نوع بوتاکس نمی باشد و تا چندین سال اثر آن بر پوست باقی می ماند مثل تزریق چربی. در این گونه تزریق ها از مواد خارجی استفاده نمی کنند از داخل بدن شما چربی برداشته و در ناحیه مورد نظر چربی را تزریق می کنند.

### چه عوارض هایی به هنگام استفاده نکردن از بهترین مارک ژل وجود دارد؟

عوارض هایی که در جهت تزریق ژل وجود دارد بستگی به نوع مارک ژل و افرادی که این تزریقات را انجام می دهد، دارد. ممکن است برخی از افراد دچار سوزش و لکه هایی در ناحیه اخم بشوند اما این عارضه ها معمولا کوتاه مدت هستند اما احساس غیر قابل تحملی را برای فردی که این تزریق ژل را انجام داده است، ایجاد می کند.

شایع ترین این عارضه کبودی، عفونت و واکنش نشان دادن به نوع ژلی است که شما استفاده کرده اید. نحوه تزریق این گونه ژل ها می تواند در بروز یکسری عارضه ای دیگر نیز تاثیر گذار باشد. ممکن است شما دچار پوسته پوسته شدن در آن قسمت از تزریق بشوید.

شما همچنین باید مراقب تزریق ژل دائمی نیز باشید زیرا ممکن است شما را دچار مشکلات دائمی یا بلند مدت کند.

### چگونه بهترین مارک ژل برای تزریق ژل خط اخم بشناسیم؟

بسیاری از افراد که قصد دارند تزریق فیلر برای خط اخم را انجام بدهند به دنبال برای تزریق هستند؛ اما نمی دانند که چگونه بهترین مارک ژل را شناسایی و انتخاب کنند. ما چند روش را برای این کار به شما پیشنهاد می کنیم.

در ابتدا به یک پزشک متخصص در زمینه تزریق ژل مراجعه کنید و در مورد انتظارات و خواسته خود به وسیله تزریق ژل با او صحبت کنید و از او بخواهید که بهترین نوع ژل را با توجه به مشکل و نوع پوست شما پیشنهاد دهد.

قبل از انجام هر گونه تزریقاتی در خصوص زیبایی در مشاوره و کلاس های قبل از عمل حضور داشته باشید تا بتوانید از بهترین نکات و انواع ژل های بوتاکس آگاهی کسب کنید.

شما می توانید با استفاده از این گونه روش های شناسایی بهترین تزریق ژل را بسته به نوع پوست خود انتخاب کنید تا از بروز هرگونه عارضه شدید جلوگیری کنید.

پس در نتیجه انتخاب بهترین کیفیت در هر گونه عمل زیبایی تاثیر مستقیمی در نتیجه گیری شما از عمل زیبایی خواهد داشت. شما برای انتخاب بهترین تزریق ژل به شنیده ها کفایت نکنید و به پرس و جوی بیشتری در این باره بپردازید زیرا همانطور که گفته شد هرگونه عمل زیبایی از اهمیت زیادی برخوردار است.

اگر شما نتیجه عکس از این گونه عمل های زیبایی بگیرید دچار افسردگی و عدم عزت نفس خواهید شد در نتیجه به جای رفع کردن مشکل خود مشکلی دیگر با بی توجهی اضافه می کنید.

شما می توانید با مراجعه به **کلینیک تخصصی پوست و مو رز** با متخصصین مجرب این [**کلینیک تزریق ژل**](https://rozclinic.com/best-gel-injection-clinic-in-tehran/) مشورت نمایید. جهت مشاوره با شماره **۰۲۱۴۴۰۶۷۰۰۵** تماس بگیرید.",2020-01-07 07:00:30+00:00,1,0

بوتولینیوم توکسین، یک سم موثر بر سیستم عصبی عضلانی است و توسط میکروبی بنام کلستریدیوم بوتولینیوم درست می شود. اثر آن ابتدا در مسمومیت ناشی غذای فاسد شناخته شد و بعد بعنوان یک سلاح شیمیایی در جنگ جهانی اول بکار رفت.امروزه از این ماده فقط برای مصارف درمانی و زیبایی استفاده می‌شود .

بوتولینیوم توکسین موجب فلج کردن عضله می شود بطوریکه عضله ای که این ماده به آن تزریق شده به فرمان عصب خود هیچ واکنشی نشان نمی دهد و منقبض نمی شود.

### آیا تزریق بوتاکس عوارضی هم دارد؟

امروزه بوتولینیوم توکسین برای حدود ۵۰ مورد درمانی و زیبایی بصورت تزریقی استفاده می‌شود . مقادیر تزریق شده بسیار بسیار اندک است و به هیچ وجه جذب بدن نمی شود و هیچ اثری بر سایر نواحی بدن ندارد.برای از بین بردن یک موش آزمایشگاهی لازم است ۱۶ هزار تا از آمپول هایی که برای زیبایی استفاده می شود، به آن موش تزریق بشود پس نباید از عوارض عمومی تزریق این دارو هراس داشت.

موارد درمانی استفاده از این دارو شامل درمان بعضی از انواع [انحراف چشم](http://drerfanian.com/%d8%af%d8%b1%d9%85%d8%a7%d9%86-%d8%a7%d9%86%d8%ad%d8%b1%d8%a7%d9%81-%da%86%d8%b4%d9%85/)( استرابیسم )، اسپاسم پلک و صورت ، تعدادی از بیماری های ارتوپدی و بعضی اختلالات مری و بلع، می باشد.

اما شهرت بیشتر این دارو ، استفاده در موارد زیبایی است.

اولین  فرم دارویی این ماده که به بازار آمد بوتاکسBOTOX نام داشت و دارد که تولید کشور امریکاست و نام عمومی برای اطلاق به انواع این ماده دارویی را بدست آورده است. این دارو اولین مارکی بود که تایید سازمان غذا و داروی امریکا(FDA) را بدست آورد، در گذشتهاین دارو به کشور ما صادر نمی‌شود.

پس از بوتاکس داروی تولیدی کشور انگلیس بنام دیسپورت (Dysport)مجوز  تجویز گرفت و این دارو به کشور ما وارد می شود و اجازه وزارت بهداشت را دارد.

دوسال پیش از کشور آلمان داروی زئومین(Xeomin)هم تایید FDA را بدست آورد و در کشور ما وجود دارد و استفاده می شود.

چند ماه پیش دارویی بنام Jeuveau هم به این بازار وارد شد، که طرفداران بسیاری دارد .

### نحوه تزریق بوتاکس

تزریق بوتاکس در مطب و یا درکلینیک  توسط پزشک باید انجام شود .  برای بوتاکس معمولا از سوزن های بسیار ظریفی استفاده می کنند  که معمولا درد شدید و غیر قابل تحمل ندارد، در نتیجه نیاز به استفاده از مواد بی حس  کننده موضعی نمی باشد .

ابتدا لازم است برای تزریق  نواحی مورد نظر برای تزریق بوتاکس ضد عفونی شود، سپس پزشک با کمک  سرنگ مقداری از مواد بوتاکس را  به  نواحی از صورت همچون چانه، پیشانی و.. تزریق کند .

نتیجه بوتاکس معمولا  همان روز  مشخص نمی شود و لازم است  کمی صبور باشید .  لازم به ذکر است که تزریق بوتاکس ماندگار نیست و  باید  به صورت دوره  ای معمولا ۳ تا ۴ماه بعد  مجدد  تزریق صورت گیرد .

### نقاط تزریق بوتاکس

[تزریق بوتاکس](http://drerfanian.com/%d8%aa%d8%b2%d8%b1%db%8c%d9%82-%d8%a8%d9%88%d8%aa%d8%a7%da%a9%d8%b3/) برای کم کردن چین و چروک های اطراف چشم مانند خط اخم ، خطوط پیشانی و خطوط گوشه چشم استفاده می شود. می توان از تکنیک های خاص برای کمی بالاتر بردن انتهای ابرو ها استفاده کرد تا چشم ها زیبا تر به نظر بیایند.

دکتر رضا عرفانیان سلیم، از سال ۸۲ تزریق بوتاکس را برای کاربرد های زیبایی و درمانی  انجام می دهند و در این زمینه تجربه بسیار بالایی دارند .

### محدودیت استفاده از بوتاکس

بر اساس توصیه اداره غذا و داروی امریکا مصرف داروی بوتاکس برای افراد زیر ۱۸ سال ، خانم های باردار و شیرده ممنوع است هرچند تا کنون عارضه ای در این موارد گزارش نشده است و همینطور در بیماران مبتلا به MS و بیماری‌های عصبی عضلانی مانند میاستنی گراویس منع مصرف نسبی دارد،

بهتر است جهت پیشگیری از ایجاد کبودی در محل تزریق از چند روز قبل داروهای رقیق کننده خون قطع شوند.

### آیا بوتاکس عوارض هم دارد ؟

در صورت وجود ناحیه تورم در محل تزریق مانند جراحی پلک و بینی و یا تاتو ابرو یا کانون عفونی مانند جوش پوستی ، از تزریق پرهیز شود تا تورم بر طرف گردد چراکه احتمال گسترش دارو به طرف چشم و ایجاد عوارض وجود خواهد داشت.

مهم‌ترین عوارض بعد از بوتاکس، درد در هنگام تزریق و گاهی ایجاد کبودی در محل تزریق، ایجاد افتادگی پلک و یا دوبینی است که در صورت استفاده از داروی اصل و کاربرد تکنیک صحیح احتمال بروز آنها اندک است.

### آیا بوتاکس برای خطوط گردن هم موثر است ؟

معمولا خطوط گردن در زمان حرف زدن و یا دیگر فعالیت های بدن نمایان می شوند . خیلی از افراد به دلیل بالا رفتن سن دچار افتادگی در این نواحی می شوند ، تزریق بوتاکس  برای خطوط  گردن هم می تواند انتخاب خوبی باشد .  برای  تزریق بوتاکس به نواحی گردن  باید با فشار دادن  دندان ها به یکدیگر این خطوط را بیشتر نمایان کنیم، بعد  از مشخص شدن نواحی عضلانی این ناحیه  باید تزریق به فاصله  1تا 1/5 سانتی متری از  خط فکم تا پایین گردن انجام شود . لازم به ذکر است که برای خطوط نازک تر گردن نیاز به 5 تا10 واحد تزریق است ، هر چه این خطوط ضخیم تر باشد، این مقدار  افزایش پیدا می کند و به 10 تا 15 واحد  هم می رسد .

### نکات مورد توجه

توجه بفرمایید داروهایی که با نام آنها اشاره شده است، تنها دارو های مجوز دار علمی هستند که تزریق آنها بدون عارضه عمومی و مناسب برای تزریق است،

ولی در این آشفته بازار فعلی بسیاری دارو های دیگر با و بدون شناسنامه وجود دارند که گاهی حتی مجوز های داخلی هم دارند! ولی متاسفانه عوارض موضعی و عمومی خطرناکی دارند که توصیه می شود تنها، به دلیل  ارزان تر بودن این داروها از تن دادن به تزریق این قبیل داروها بپرهیزید .",2020-01-06 11:55:47+00:00,1,0

chc6ds,AskDocs,Forehead Bulge on top of and above right eyebrow,"Age: 31

Sex: Female

Height: 5'5""

Weight: 118 lbs

Race: Caucasian

Duration of Complaint: The bulge started 3 days ago.  I've had pressure in my forehead when looking down for a couple of weeks.

Location: Forehead

Existing Relevant Medical Issues:  None

Current Medication: I received 18 units of Jeuveau in my forehead on July 2nd to help with headaches and prevent development of wrinkles.  I only mention this because my mom keeps blaming the Jeuveau for my symptoms which doesn't make sense to me.  In March 2018, I received 16 units of traditional Botox in my forehead with zero issues.

&#x200B;

For the past few weeks, I have been having issues with pressure in my forehead, especially when I lean my head over.  On Sunday,  I started feeling the pressure constantly. My significant other asked me if I knew that I had a bulge over my right eyebrow.  On Monday and Tuesday, the pain was also in my cheekbones and jaw.  I am now back to feeling pain only in my right forehead,eye, and top of my nose.  

It's now at the point where there isn't any sort of relief whether I am sitting, standing, propped in different angles, looking up, or lying flat.  My right eyeball hurts, is bloodshot,  and I have blurry vision with a lot of tearing up.  I do not have a fever or any signs of congestion.  My nose has actually been clearer and easier to breathe out of than usual. There is no back drip.  I do have a metallic taste in my mouth and can't smell very well despite my nose being clear. I would have to say it is pretty painful compared to other headaches due to it being a very intense pressure that feels like my head is going to explode when I change positions.   I have been trying to use steam and decongestants because I figure it might be my sinuses but neither has given me relief.  

I am curious if you all think this might be sinusitis and if it is something I can wait out or if I should head to the doctor.  I have finals and all work in my abbreviated Chem 1 course due on Friday, so I wanted to make sure it was alright to wait until next week if I didn't end up feeling better over the weekend.  I am reluctant to visit a doctor because I don't have insurance right now and have tuition payments coming up in August, so I am trying to figure out if it's potentially serious or something to wait for my immune system to sort out.  Thank you all very much!",2019-07-24 18:43:51+00:00,1,1

a117k8,Esthetics,Working with a Physician as an Owner of a Medical Spa,"Location: Bellevue, WA

My girlfriend is completing her Master Esthetics program in a few weeks. I want to give her a business plan to own her own medical spa as a form of graduation present.

From what I've gleaned from conversations with her, this state requires you to be a PA or RN in order to perform advanced treatment like Botox and laser work. It also requires you to ""work with"" a physician -- an actual doctor -- who will provide treatment plans and diagnoses. I also know that the physician does not have to be on-site, just have an office nearby (I think she said 30mi).

How ... would this arrangement work? I read somewhere that the physician pays the spa for covering all the risk, but that doesn't really make much sense to me. Also how would I go about estimating this income / expenditure?",2018-11-28 01:12:00+00:00,5,5
