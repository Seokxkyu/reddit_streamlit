1kq5wp6,handbags,Bag recommendations with good organization?,"Hi! I’m looking for a medium-sized everyday bag with an adjustable strap (I’d like the option of having it both as a shoulder and crossbody bag). Preferably a bag with outside pocket organization and/or good interior organization (I carry a lot of small items and would rather have pockets than multiple pouches). I’m about 5’2 so I also have to be cautious of how bags look on my frame. 

I’m a “just in case” packer so I carry my little emergency kit, 2-3 lippies, sanitizer, lotion, hair comb, reusable bag, portable charger (sometimes), sunglasses, and wallet/phone/keys ofc. 

#1 pic - Attaching styles I like - I got the Marge sherwood outpocket and I loved the outpockets but the bag itself looked too long (length-wise) on me and the leather quality left a bit to be desired. I also loved the silver hardware.

#2 pic - I have the goodtotes cargo sling, but it can’t be worn as a crossbody, and the canvas material isn’t the best. It’s also a bit too small for all my things. I love the outside pockets and the interior organization though. 

#3 pic - I love interior organization!

I’m not completely stuck on the idea of outside pockets (huge plus), but it definitely needs to have good interior organization. I’d prefer the bag style to look cool, with silver hardware if possible! I’d appreciate any recommendations! Thanks in advance :)",2025-05-19 07:38:52+00:00,1,1

1kq4nkh,handbags,Need help getting oil out of bag!,"I just came back from vacation and saw that a bath&body works body oil COMPLETELY spilled inside a tote bag I left at home. And when I say spilled… I mean the previously full bottle is now empty. I was on vacation for 2 weeks so who knows how long the oil has been sitting inside my purse, getting absorbed. I tried using dawn dish soap (hand washed) but I can’t get the oily feeling out. Whenever I put items inside the bag, they come out feeling oily. Btw, this is the tote bag for context: https://kouhightoys.com/products/new-pop-mart-skullpanda-image-of-reality-series-pu-bag

It was a silly mistake :( and pretty sure this bag is limited edition so I don’t think I can get a replacement. The exterior is fake leather and the inside feels like a smooth canvas-like fabric.

Any advice on what I can do to save this bag? I’m willing to go to a cleaners or professional, just not sure if this is something they can fix.

BTW: no visible oil stains and I don’t really care if the “look” of the bag changes. I just want it to be functional again and stop feeling oily inside.",2025-05-19 06:12:09+00:00,1,3
1kq3x37,handbags,Purses smell like smoke - help!!,"I picked up a box of purses (most are leather) that I hoped to resell, but they all smell of cigarette smoke. 

I’ve cleaned them with leather cleaner, sprayed down cloth interiors with a 1:1 denatured alcohol & distilled water mix, then put them in my spare room with an air purifier & open window with a fan to blow fresh air in, but it doesn’t seem to have gotten rid of it all. 

I’ve read that ‘remove smell’ sprays don’t work (would activated charcoal or Ozium help??). I’ve also read that putting them outside on a sunny day (or two) *could* help…

When I inspected it closely (faintly stamped 7VA003), I also saw a ‘HAPPY NEW YEAR 2005’ stamp by the strap.

I also felt something inside the lining. It felt like the same clip outside the bag. I looked for holes and saw a tiny tear on its side pocket, and fished out the same clip albeit a smoother one.

Does anyone have it? Any thoughts/opinions? 

Does the fold stay like that or do you have to constantly fix it? I had been looking for a white/creamish bag and this seems perfect for it, but if the fold doesn’t stay like that then I don’t love the shape as much. I had to keep fixing it at the store, and the sales person there said that the bag has to be ‘trained’ to retain that shape.

1kpz9a3,handbags,Not a handbag: a lightweight backpack?,"Ok, ok, this may not be the place given that this subreddit is called “handbags”.  But you all are so welcoming and have good taste, so I figured I’d ask. 

Long story short, due to some medical needs, there are times where I’m going to be out and about for many hours and need to carry a (smallish) sackful of things. On shorter days, I just toss my stuff in a Longchamp or a cute medium-to-large crossbody and I’m good to go. But over a whole day, this can be too wearing, and a backpack then becomes much more optimal since it distributes weight evenly and leaves hands free. However the wrinkle is that for this to be most effective it needs to be lightweight, and due to what I carry, I need something that won’t easily get messy / ruined… so leather, for example, is out. 

So, hive mind: any cute options to suggest?! I’ve considered the Longchamp backpack, but I’m just not in love. I found the Rebecca Minkoff Julian in nylon, which checks many boxes and at least seems cute online - haven’t seen it in person yet. 

What other backpacks might you suggest that are both functional, lightweight, and yet also looo lovely (or even “sophisticated”)? Additional bonus points for water bottle/umbrella holder, though I’m not going to hold my breath for that too. Goal would be $200 or less mostly bc I know this will get tossed around / beat up, and I’d be paranoid with something pricier in this scenario. ",2025-05-19 00:57:09+00:00,1,3

1kpxqio,handbags,Just bought my mens Saint Laurent large sac de jour in croc,"Crocodile embossed that is..

I'm a little late to the Sac de Jour game but I finally purchased this bag I wanted for awhile now. 

I bought directly from the Ala Moana Saint Laurent in Honolulu.  This particular size and style bag isn't really sold anymore and they had to get one from the store in Toronto. 

Although it looks small to me,  that is because my frame of reference had always been online viewing and youtube unboxings. Plus I am 6'3"".

It fits so much,  I have my Chromebook in there but along with everything else, I can also put my 14"" Mac in there. I've added some photos. I have this Gecko trinket someone made for me years ago that I've added to personalize the bag. Just love this guy. 

One silly thing that i love is to put a folded sweater over the top to keep prying eyes away as this has no zip closure. I found a Comme des Garcons sweater in my closet with the eyes peeking out that i found a fun touch. I totally knew what this bag was all about way before I purchased so no issues regarding the closure.

SL  is changing their logo and i prefer the black and white Saint Laurent font so I had to ask if they still had the black shopping bag as they were preparing to provide me the new white bag.

One thing is that I  just cannot figure out what that lock is supposed to lock!

1kpps0i,handbags,What do we think? Should I get this bag?,"I really love it, but am a little bit on the fence due to its large size. It’s basically a tote with a different shape, and it is *actually* intended to be a crossbody. Dimensions are 10"" H X 15"" L X 6"" D. 

I used to exclusively carry totes, and now still carry fairly large bags as my EDC, but I don’t want to look silly since I’m only 5’4” and about 135lbs - so not big by any stretch of the imagination. 

I’ve been eyeing it for a few weeks, and I can now get it for an amazing price (under $300 when the original owner purchased it for over $400 and retail is about $600). 

Pros:

1. The navy color is gorgeous!
2. Amazing pebbles. 
3. Big enough for anything and everything I’d need for any given day/occasion. 
4. Two exterior pockets. 

Cons:

1. Maybe too big?
2. Grab handles don’t allow for a comfortable shoulder carry.

1kpnknf,handbags,Mulberry - vintage vs. new black cherry? Some questions,"Hi all! I have been looking to upgrade my cotton tote for a proper work bag for some time now and the Mulberry Bayswater has caught my eye. When I went to their website, the black cherry color caught my eye, and I was thrilled to see that it had silver hardware. However, I HATE that the bag is lined with microfiber. That is not a texture that I enjoy and think that it would cheapen the overall vibe. With some online research I have found that some of the older bags had suede lining, and I can find similar colors like oxblood and black forest, however, they do have gold hardware so I would need to make the determination of how much that matters to me. I have a few questions for those who have owned or considered any of these bags:

\- Is the suede vs. microfiber really that big of a deal or should I just get over myself?

\- I have noticed different leather types in the new vs. old bags. Will the grained leathers develop a lovely patina? Or does that only happen with the natural vegetable tanned leathers?

\- Anyone have any experience in choosing a bag with a non-preferred hardware color? Regrets or changes of heart?",2025-05-18 16:10:55+00:00,2,1

1kpko1k,handbags,PSA: People selling fakes on Poshmark,"I mean I knew people sold fakes trying to pass it off as real, but I didn’t expect it to happen to me (classic, I know!) I picked up this “Coach Brooklyn” off Poshmark and learned my lesson. 

As soon as I opened the package it smelled like plastic. The handle was super flimsy, the interior was completely smooth plastic, the stitching wasn’t right, the button on the back was installed CROOKED (and the real one just says Coach not New York), and the dust bag was the flimsiest plastic satin I’ve ever seen. 

If it seems too good to be true, it is. I decided to go for the Poshmark one since it was a lower price but was already a little suspicious because I realized after I submitted my offer that the seller had 4 or 5 identical listings.. like using the exact same photos. I was a little bit fooled because the pics included what appeared to be a shipping box from Coach, tissue paper etc… and I wasn’t quite sure about the bag so I thought it would be a good way to try it out. 

In the end, I reported the seller and submitted a return request to Poshmark (which they approved) then went to Coach and just picked up a Brooklyn after deciding I loved the bag.

I got it over a year ago at an antique/flea market sort of thing in Monferrato, Northern Italy.
The lady selling it gave it to me for €50, although I don't know if it helps for the ID.
I think she said it had to do something with France, but don't quote me on that because it was quite some time ago and my memory isn't the best.
It has no label or brand in sight, but I did find that diamond shaped sheet made of the same material as the bag in the zipped pocket.

As you can see, one of the handles is broken and the other is giving out as well and I'm looking to get it repaired because I am absolutely in love with it!

I'm not expecting a crazy value on this, but I'm curious to understand if it is, in fact, real leather.
If so, what kind and possibly what brand it is?
It looks and feels a little old, but I have no experience on this matter and I might be 100% off.

Hopefully someone can help me out :)

The show was French and seemed to showcase a lot of French design houses (like Jerome Dreyfuss) so it's likely a French brand, but I've searched by brand and still can't ID this bag.

I'm including pics from all angles I could screenshot. It's red suede with either navy or black leather. It has 2 handles and 2 large gold zippers. I initially thought it was the Celine Edge bag, but that one only has 1 zipper and the red doesn't wrap around the side (like it does on this bag). Any thoughts?

1kp8dr1,handbags,Help me pick please!,"Looking for a cream colored casual bag for summer. I have a white/cream clutch in embossed leather with a chain and it’s too fancy for casual use so looking for something to fill that. I have a YSL in taupe which is more like a very light brown, so I’m thinking I shouldn’t go for Strathberry as that’s too similar of a color.

All these look very cool, help me decide! If you have either of these would love to hear your opinions.

1kp7oxk,handbags,A walk on the “wild” side…,"Brahmin bags aren’t everyone’s cup of tea; I get it.  However, this medium Duxbury satchel in “Feline Hermosa” looked fun to me.  Croc-embossed with lizard-embossed trim, tiger print…and an unexpected hint of iridescence in a few places.  It sounds ridiculous, but something about it works.  I think of it as a “loud” neutral.

That said, even though I’d seen the bag specs, it’s a little larger than I anticipated.  I also prefer the centered “eye” placement on the back of the bag (2nd photo)- and wish that was the front.  I love that the handles can fold down, rather than being fixed upright.  Plenty of interior pockets, plus two pen loops and a key clip.  My iPhone does fit in the outside pocket on the back…but only without its phone case.

Still need to play a bit more with styling before I remove the tag and metal protection, but I’m probably keeping her.",2025-05-18 00:42:02+00:00,30,6

Things I like about 
1. Gucci Sylvie - boxy, good shoulder strap and length, has young cool energy. Downside - the gold accessories are a little eye catching
2. Celine - muted and understated, seems to fit more. Downside - the handles are a bit small so I can only hold that way. The side saddles are also a little long for my height, not sure if they are adjustable.

it’s been about 18-20 since I bought it years and somehow gotten damaged and the bag is crumbling away on the outside. There’s just nothing I can do about it.
I can’t tell you how fucking devastated I am that it’s cooked !!

I’m thinking about pulling all the skulls off of it and then maybe cutting the bag off and keeping the handle with the brass knuckles and stuff because it’s so cool 
And maybe I could get someone who knows how to make items repurpose it for me   so it’s kind of like a new bag but with parts from a previous lifetime.

Or I might see if some sort sort of crafty person wants to maybe buy them and make their own joy!!

I’ve never posted in here before, but I’m just so devastated about it. I needed to talk to a group of people who cared about bags.

1kp2mc3,handbags,Got a Jacquemus Le Chiquito Noeud for 290€ on Farfetch Pre-Owned. Is this normal?,"Hey! I just bought a Jacquemus Pre-Owned Le Chiquito Noeud mini bag from Farfetch’s pre-owned section, and I’m honestly a bit shocked. It was only €290 (I think that’s around $315–$320 USD?). I’m adding pics from the listing.

I do trust Farfetch completely. I’ve been buying from them for years, and so have my family and friends, so I’ve always felt safe ordering through them. The bag is listed as EXCELLENT condition, and the seller is one of their boutiques in Portugal.

I never really looked into those bags. Maybe I’m not that crazy about bags in general, and for a bag that could barely fit a phone, they were always close to a thousand euros, which felt wild. I’d rather spend that money on something else entirely.

I’ve been wanting a small red bag for a while now, and this one just felt right. Still, the price seemed unusually low for what it is. It looks like the regular version, full size, no damage, nothing missing. 
Or maybe I’m just not familiar with the market and the pricing is fine? I need feedback lol 

Has anyone bought Jacquemus pre-owned before or used Farfetch’s secondhand section? I’d love to hear your thoughts. I’m getting it next week and can update once it arrives.

- more colorways & availability
- no need for an extension strap to wear cross body
- can be carried by the top handle
- I am drawn to the BV woven leather motif

Some pros of the Loewe bag:
- able to be zipped
- accordion style opening is appealing and well-designed
- possibly more timeless/less trendy?

1ko57s3,handbags,Charli with Charles & Keith Bag,"One thing that’s stuck with me over the past 6 months is when someone posted about their first designer bag, and it was Charles and Keith.

The nasties were out in full force telling them that it wasn’t designer instead of sharing their excitement with them.

It made my heart explode (in the best way) to learn that after having to endure that unkindness, the poster was actually invited to their HQ and I believe got to pick out another bag or two.

I hope that user is still loving their bags and using them in good health.

Anyways, here’s Charli XCX at Cannes with a Charles and Keith bag!

I think she looks so cool, and it’s proof that you don’t need a luxury bag to look stylish. She looks just as cool carrying this bag as she does her $5800 Gucci Jackie.

1knv75d,handbags,Longchamp Épure XS Toast Bag,"When I saw this bag in an ig reel a few weeks, I fell in love right away and waited for the bag to be available online. I have been looking for a brown bag with the following conditions:
1. Sturdy leather (so no lambskin), which I can use without any concern in summer, when I am out and about more often than in winter. I usually go cycling, go to beer gardens (yes I live in Germany), or sit on grass.
2. Zipper-closing: because I travel a lot, I need that extra security.


Since I couldn't find any online reviews yet, here's my first attempt at posting on this sub! 

The bag is quite sturdy. The leather feels hard and a bit plastic-y. According to the website the leather is ""durable and supple grained Russian cowhide leather"" -- same as the flaps on the popular Longchamp Le Pliage bags. The zipper feels sturdy as well. Since only the top half of the ""toast"" opens, you need to get used to a small and a rather narrow opening, unless you can stomach opening it widely and creating a crease (I certainly can't).

Lastly: I debated between this bag and Longchamp Épure XS Shopper bag (2nd photo) for a few weeks. What ultimately led to the toast bag is 
a. Uniqueness of the shape (a bit kitschy, I know, but I just love it)
b. The Shopper bag has no zipper (prone to pickpockets or at least my anxiety) and the Toast bag has it.

Let me know if you have any questions :)

1knqe7x,handbags,Choosing my first day to evening carry!,"I started building a small collection of bags last year and it’s been so fun! I’m now looking to save up and add a day to evening carry to my collection.

I’m currently stuck between the Strathberry Crescent Moon and new Coach Jonie 22 as I really enjoy the crescent silhouette. If anyone has any thoughts or experiences they’d like to share, I’d love to hear them, please! Thanks in advance!

Some considerations:

Crescent Moon (https://us.strathberry.com/products/crescent-moon-black)
* $645
* Larger at 10.2” L x 7.5” H x 4.7”
* 100% Smooth Calf Leather and soft microfibre lining
* Appears slouchier
* Comes in black, oxblood, and oat
* Zipper closure
* Metal top handle is not detachable
* Comes with chain and leather crossbody strap
* Personally, I’m not much into the hardware styling on Strathberry bags, but I do enjoy it on this one
* My current collection is nearly all Coach, so this would be my first (exciting) step into exploring other brands

Jonie 22 (https://www.dillards.com/p/coach-jonie-22-shoulder-bag/520146864)
* $295
* Smaller at 8.5"" L x 8.75"" H x 2.75"" W
* Glovetanned leather and fabric lining (I’m pretty familiar with how this leather wears and how to care for it)
* Appears to have more structure
* Comes in black, maple, chalk
* Zipper closure
* Comes with detachable leather shoulder and crossbody straps
* Ends at the top can be hooked together for a rounder dumpling/wristlet style
* I already own a black Coach Re-Issue Dinky that I was gifted for my birthday

1knpdo0,handbags,How do I best carry bills in a mini purse?,"Dear Redditors,

I have recently hopped on the mini bag trend and am trying to figure out the best way to carry bills and cards etc. My issue is that any mini wallets take up too much room in the purse to the point that I won't be able to fit much else in it (like my phone), but bills are also annoying to fold up into a card holder/get crumpled and are hard to pull out/stuff back in/organize by value. So, any suggestions would be most appreciated! 

For reference: 

\-I am Canadian thus the currency I am most interested in storing is Canadian size bills, which are 152x70mm, and which are made out of a plasticky material similar to Australian bills. This is part of why they are annoying to fold as they don't really stay folded

\-This is the purse I am working with: [https://www.sancia.com.au/products/the-cerda-mini-cranberry-croc?\_pos=3&\_sid=cfd149ac5&\_ss=r](https://www.sancia.com.au/products/the-cerda-mini-cranberry-croc?_pos=3&_sid=cfd149ac5&_ss=r)

\-this wallet looked promising but will just take up too much space, I think: [https://ca.coach.com/en/products/essential-billfold-wallet/CD717+B4%2FBK.html?searchSection=recentProduct](https://ca.coach.com/en/products/essential-billfold-wallet/CD717+B4%2FBK.html?searchSection=recentProduct) 

\-Currently I am thinking about folding the bills in half and just using a paperclip to hold them together (or a cheap money clip if I can find one for less than 20 bucks). But a more elegant solution would be preferred. 

Thank you to everyone who reads this :) ",2025-05-16 01:51:56+00:00,2,2

1knofpu,handbags,Well…it happened,"I really needed a new bag. My Pearl is just a bit too small for everyday. My Coccinelle Boheme is perfect, and the metallic leather is beautiful. But I don’t want to have to baby it. 

I’ve been eyeing the LV Carryall Cargo. However, between the negative press, and the price I decided to get this beauty instead. (Funny note: my husband said I could have the LV or another trip to Costa Rica).

The Coach is a nice size. The leather is nicer than I expected. (I think the Brooklyn is a little thin).  I wish it had more pockets inside, but I have a cute bag to hold things. I really like all the straps. I can do crossbody or shoulder. And the straps are wider so they seem to stay on my shoulder and are more comfortable than a skinny strap.  And with the cost a fraction of the LV I figure it’s a good trial if I do change my mind. 

Anyone else have this bag? Thoughts on it?

I thought I wanted the Hug in Lucky Charme (which just went on sale for $1600 👀 ) but then this Cumin color came out and I’m so torn - it’s so bright and lovely! 
I stayed at the Wynn in Vegas a few weeks ago and was able to actually see all of these bags in person albeit different colors (except the LV) and out of all of them I actually liked the Loewe Puzzle Fold Pouch the most due to size and simple shape HOWEVER I thought that due to size and shape it should not be quite so pricy.. 
I also fell in love with the Andiamo and would have actually purchased while in Vegas had they had the Travertine color in stock .. but now that I’m home I think I’m stuck on the Rose color idk!!! Also $4700 is a bit rich for my blood; $2500 is about my limit for these things. I’m staying in Oregon right now so no sales tax - it’s the right time to buy.
Someone posted their vintage LV Denim Pleaty so naturally I’m feeling the Sunset… it’s such a cute fun size but again, $3k for something NOT leather is a hard sell… then the Le Teckel. I saw these at the Foubtainbleau and wasn’t entirely impressed IRL but they also only had black, so it’s last on the list. 
1. Loewe Puzzle Fold Pouch in Blue Iceberg 
2. Ferragamo Hug in Cumin (this color is way more Turmeric than Cumin in my opinion 😉)
3. Bottega Veneta Small Andiamo in Rose
4. Louis Vuitton Sunset in Pink Denim
5. Alaia Le Teckel Small in Blue

I bought it 15 years ago in high school to fit in. I've no idea anymore how much it cost or how much it would be worth now, but the sentimental value made it irreplaceable. 

The other one was a radley I'd been eyeing for months until it finally went on sale. My dream bag, essentially. Radley doesn't seem to ship to the EU anymore, so I had it delivered to my godmother in the US, who kindly shipped it to my grandma in country A, who gave it to my mom to country B, who then sent it with the longchamp to the country I live in... We do this all the time and never has anything gotten lost. Until this time. 

We obviously had it tracked and it was supposedly delivered – but I never got anything. After several phone calls with customer service today they finally told me the package was registered as an Amazon return and delivered to an Amazon processing center or whatever. They wouldn't tell me where or which one, but apparently I wasn't the addressee of the package anyway.

I've no idea what happened. The tracking number exists, the sender is correct (my mom via my brother) and the post branch it was sent from is the same. 

I've filed a compensation claim and a complaint and I guess I can wait to see what comes of it but I have a feeling I'm out 500 bucks.

I went to the Grant Bazar and some streets in the Old Town, but all they had was replicas of big brands. Not even funny ones like a Christian Doir, of Balineciega, which I would've bought. I guess there are higher end shopping streets (so, not for tourist) with good Turkish brand, but I was on a business trip, so no time for that. It is sad though that those traditional markets are just full of Chinese replicas (I asked the sellers where they got them). But I wonder who buys them. I saw nobody around wearing them... Anyways I came back home empty handed except for a mini birkin dupe for my Labubus. End of rant. ",2025-05-15 19:32:36+00:00,2,2

1kng238,handbags,Le Jardin Goyard,"Did I read all the posts recently about how Goyard quality has gone down? Yes. Did I buy one anyway? Also yes. But I couldn’t resist this color and print. I got the St. Louis PM in Iris and a Yellow Vendome cosmetic case. Anyway, I thought I would tell my experience purchasing through Goyard’s distant sales option since I couldn’t find much info about it before I tried it. 

I don’t live anywhere near a Goyard boutique, so I put in a distant sales request via the Goyard website. After a month of no response, I emailed them and then I got a response within about a week. An SA at the Chicago boutique texted me and I told him what I was looking for. He said they didn’t have any in stock right then but maybe next week they would. But then he texted me on Sunday and said they got the bag I wanted in stock! I said I’d take it so he emailed me a purchase contract to fill out and then I got a Neiman Marcus email link where I could make payment (the Chicago Goyard is in a Neiman Marcus I believe). I paid on Monday, and my items arrived today! Pretty easy for something that I thought I could only get by waiting in line in person.

That said, I love the look of the bag, and I don’t plan to use it as an everyday lug-around-a-heavy-laptop tote, so I’m hopeful that it will stay nice. FWIW, the little booklet that came with the bag does specifically say that the St. Louis is a beach bag and not intended for heavy use, and that Goyard has other bags if you need a workhorse. 💁‍♀️

The Vendome cosmetic case is a great size and slightly larger than the LV monogram one I’m currently using. 

Prices, because I couldn’t find that info online either:
Special Edition St. Louis PM $2,450
Vendome cosmetic case $880
Express shipping $60

(Anyone else see these prices and have the most reaction to shipping being $60?! Or just me…😳)",2025-05-15 18:49:03+00:00,286,36

1kndy9e,handbags,My Featherlight,"I bought this bag a few weeks ago and I absolutely love it. I am really into the feel of the leathers used on bags. Last year I happened to see my nearest Neiman Marcus carried Loewe while walking around and touched their bags for the first time. I was floored by the softness of the Flamenco purse. I had the burgundy on my wish list for a while but could never pull the trigger. The Puzzle was ok but the calfskin felt too stiff for me. 

When I saw a new Puzzle was going to be introduced, I was definitely interested. It looked so slouchy and soft. When it finally dropped, it seemed like it sold out quick. I sold a few of my bags to save up for it if it came back. 

I had a trip to Houston planned, so I called ahead to the boutique to see if they might have any in store. Unfortunately, they said they didn’t have any. So I planned to buy the flamenco in person on my trip. 

On the day I went to the boutique, I was surprised they had the black and dark butter in store! It felt meant to be. I did try on the burgundy flamenco purse again to compare but both are nappa leather so they were both great options. In the end, I went with the featherlight since I feel I can get more use from it. I love the slouch and how versatile it is. I might be nearing purse peace! ",2025-05-15 17:24:10+00:00,271,12

1knd89c,handbags,"Seeking the Perfect Travel Backpack: Durable, Polished, and Stealth-Luxury (Think Tumi, Not LV)","Hi everyone,

I’m on the hunt for a travel backpack that strikes a balance between luxury and low-profile functionality. Here’s what I’m looking for:

Durability: Something that can handle frequent travel bag that transitions well from airport lounges to more elevated destinations.

Tumi-level quality or better.

Aesthetic: Polished enough to wear in high-end settings (think boutique hotels and upscale cities) without looking overly sporty or casual.

Security & Subtlety: No flashy logos or obvious designer vibes—something that won’t scream “steal me” while abroad.
Functionality:
Luggage sleeve
Padded laptop 
Room for a water bottle
Comfortable straps for long days in transit

I don’t want something ultra high-end like Chanel or Louis Vuitton, but I’m happy to invest in something elevated that will last and look great.

I'm also very petite so something that isn't too bulky. I don't want to carry a tote as I have a little one (don't need to carry kid stuff as my child is old enough to have their own bag).

Any recs? I’ve looked at Tumi but I’d love input from this community before pulling the trigger. Thank you!",2025-05-15 16:55:39+00:00,2,3

Definitely an impulse buy, but I've been wanting a bigger handbag for when I get dressed up, to go better with my dresses as the two purses I have now are rather small. I do have the tags on it still, if I want to return it. Does anyone else have experience with leather goods?

Will it ever go away? and I've also heard you need to treat and moisturize it every now and then, how often do I need to and does anyone recommend certain products. Also is this the kind of purse I can travel with on a plane or a road trip, or is it something I should keep to more formal occasions? in other words, will it ever work a an everyday bag for work/travel and such?

According to the article, One of the Valentino controlled firms has been caught by Italian  LE in employing Chinese workers in unsafe (no protection, modified machinery, inflammable materials) and almost slavery conditions (working from 8 to 19, sleeping and living in factory, ect).

The Longchamp is lovely but the Fossil is more than half the price and I have heard good things about their quality and am wondering if they'd scratch the same itch and serve the same purpose, especially since the Longchamp isn't a ""have been coveting for ages"" bag, though I do like it and want a bag that is equally aesthetically pleasing. I basically want a nice looking bag for days I need to carry a fair amount of stuff. Ideally this bag would be nice enough that I could carry it to lunch or dinner without feeling too out of place (obviously not a dressy one where a smaller purse would be more appropriate with outfits). One downside of the Fossil is I wouldn't be able to see it in person first, but that might not be that big a deal.

Looking for a bag and hoping I’ve come to the right place. I’m struggling to find the type of bag I’m looking for at the price point I’m looking at and could do with some assistance. I seem to only have large bags (longchamp size) or clutch/small crossbody bags and I  want a classy and stylish alternative/middle ground that I can wear year round but also take on summer holidays and travel with. 

Bonus points if it’s a cool brand I’ve not heard of/that’s new and growing 😅

Looking for a leather shoulder bag with the following:

- Large enough top handle that I can actually wear over my shoulder
- Genuine leather (or suede)
- Not black (got to be able to wear with summer clothes)
- Zip or secure closure
- Big enough to fit a book (alongside phone, sunglasses etc) 
- Less than £250/$250/€250

- Not too much hardware

I was initially considering the Coach Brooklyn, but I found that everything tends to sink to the bottom. I want something sturdy that can comfortably hold my laptop, chargers, AirPods, cardholder, a small book, a makeup pouch, and essentials like sanitizer, pads, hair ties, gum, etc.

I’ve narrowed it down to two options that seem to hold their shape well and are spacious enough for all my stuff. I’ve been saving up for this, and I’m finally ready to get one! Which do you think is better: the Coach Lana Shoulder Bag or the Freja Paloma Tote? Or do you have other recommendations?",2025-05-15 05:59:18+00:00,3,1

1kmyz1n,handbags,First luxury bag!! But I'm confused?!,"Long time lurker here!
Husband got me my very first Gucci from Fashionphi le. He used to notice me getting lost scrolling through FP so he got the hint. He of course got my approval before purchase. 
Now, I love this bag. But maybe I'm feeling buyers remorse. Here's what I love about it -
1. She was listed as Excellent and is exactly as shown.
2. She has little feet.
3. Could be worn a crossbody or evening bag.
4. Size is perfect! Not too small not too big.(8W×6H×2D)inches.
5. Hardware looks nice.
6. It's unique. I haven't seen many around which makes it special for me.

Now here's what's giving me second thoughts -
1. Is it too shiny?
2. I don't like the metal strap, it's not my style. Can I find a wide long strap that balances the shiny look? The gold+shine is too much for my daily use.
3. It's HEAVYYYY! Especially with that metal strap. I wish to use it crossbody on my trips.
4. Doesn't scream GUCCI. ( One of the reasons I liked it) I'm not fan of logos but the only place this one says GUCCI is on the clasp. Is that too subtle?

I only have 24hrs to file a return, so I appreciate quick help from my fellow bag lovers. Help yo girlie out!!!

1kmxshm,handbags,Help me pick my first ever present to my mother in my 25 years of life.,"""present for my mother"" - sorry about the title.  
Hello everyone. As the title reads, I am finally buying my mom a present with the money that I have earned. I know as a 25 year old male this shouldn't be that big of a deal but I am finally in a position where I can afford a good present. My parents are comfortable and my mom does have a couple of coaches, MKs and other stuff. I was thinking of either a handbag or some Swarovski stuff.

I would really like some help picking the right one. I live in Sydney so anything available on the Australian websites would do. My parents live in a different country so I will be flying there to gift it to her.

Handbags

1. Something that looks posh and classy for a woman over the age of 50.
2. Budget $400 to $600 AUD.
3. She likes slightly bigger bags but takes smaller bags for like special occasions.
4. I don't know any other brands apart from Coach and MK. (Obviously I can't afford Channel or LV)
5. I don't know if Kate Spade or Marc Jacobs (never heard of these) have any hype similar to Coach or MK. I might be completely wrong.

Jewellery

1. Same budget $400 - $600
2. We are Indian so she already has the best gold, diamond, plat, anything.
3. She doesn't wear anything big, chunky or extravagant.
4. I literally don't know anything else.

This is for her 51st birthday!

Thank you so much :)

Price and size wise are about the same. Just a minimal difference.

My knowledge in leather is next to none, but I read a few articles about the materials and their care, being latigo a higher quality leather and somewhat waterproof.

CW-11 is made of latigo leather 
CW-35 is a soft leather bag

I took notice of the handles and CW-35 will definitely get wrinkles in the long run and that’s okay, but is there something I might be missing comparing both? I would love my bag to last long enough. 

About the style, CW-35 has a homey vibe to it. While CW-11 seems a bit more modern. But both look cute and it’s driving me nuts lol.

1kmpqzi,handbags,Horrible YSL Customer Service,"I just had the most massively disappointing experience with Yves Saint Laurent customer service.  I'm curious if this is a common issue with YSL, as I had never ordered anything from them before and left me with a horrible experience.  I'm curious to hear from others.

  
I placed an online order via chat for two bags that were surprise gifts.  I asked before placing the order if the bags could be delivered directly to Fedex for pickup instead of my home address (again, they were a surprise).  I was told absolutely, not a problem.  I place the order, which has the two bags shipping separately.  A few days later, Fedex attempts to deliver a package while no one is home.  It's caught on our security cameras, and my spouse immediately texts me asking why Fedex was there trying to deliver a package that required a signature.  I skirted around answering the question, and immediately contacted YSL.  They told me that there was no guarantee a delivery attempt would not be made.  I became extremely irritated, as this was not something relayed to me for the representative who was pushing me to order.  Aside from an apology that it happened, really don't get any accountability.  They tell me to proactively reach out to them when the second bag ships to ensure the hold is placed.  I received the notification today, so I chat with their support and say ""hey, look at the notes, please put a hold on this.  Thanks"".  I get the response ""we don't do that, you need to call these people"".  Then go through phone hell with people not understanding what's going on and telling me this should have already been done.  

  
I'm just shocked that a premium brand that sells luxury as their identity would do such a horrible job at delivering to customers.  We don't have a YSL anywhere in Minnesota, so all of my YSL purchases had previously been through Nordstrom.

In terms of budget, under 500 pounds would be great.

I've done some of my own looking and have my eye on a few options (Furla 1927, Le Tanneur Emilie), but I thought I'd ask the experts on this one in case anyone knows of anything really close. 

Alternatively, if anyone knows how to get this bag to the UK (preferably without costing an arm and a leg), I'm open to hearing it! Thanks.",2025-05-14 17:01:20+00:00,2,2

1kmh67v,handbags,Fated puzzle bag in Rome plus Italian handbag shopping report (long af),"I never cared about handbags at all until I happened across the Loewe puzzle bag a few years ago, and that started me on an obsessive journey of researching and admiring purses. I almost bought a small black classic puzzle in Japan a year and a half ago (for less than 3k with the exchange rate 😭) but walked away and have regretted it since. When I saw the new woven handle puzzles I was insanely in love and would gaze at the burgundy one online knowing I would never justify buying it ($4100 is too much for me).

Flash forward to now when I’m shopping in Italy and hoping to buy a bag in Florence. I was agonizing over a couple cool local bags, came very close to buying one and then walked out at the last minute because it felt too expensive and I just didn’t love it THAT much. It was this bag: https://benedettabruzziches.com/en/amalia-mineral-grey/
The leather quality was very good but I was worried the metal would ding or chip or discolor and I would have no way to repair it.

I was feeling sad about leaving Florence without one, and stopped into the Loewe in  Rome just to look. They had only Edge bags out, but I asked if they had any classics. She said yes, they had one, with a woven handle in burgundy (!). She said it was reserved for another customer, but they hadn’t come to pick it up and so I could just see it to get an idea of the color, but she would text them to see if they were still coming. She brought it out and it was perfect, everything I had hoped for and more. Then she got the text back that the other client had moved on (!!) and wouldn’t be coming for it. So I bought it. All together, with cheaper European prices, VAT, and exchange rate, it will be about $3100.

When I tried to buy the $1200 purse in Florence I felt so anxious and guilty, and buying this vastly more expensive bag just made my heart sing. Literally jumping up and down while drinking the champagne they brought out to celebrate. Just goes to show you it was meant to be! 

I know it’s corny to be this excited and even to spend so much, I can’t even tell my friends but I know you guys will understand. I can’t believe I finally own one and it’s mine.

Other Italy shopping notes:

—Gucci garden was very disappointing. Small selection of unique solid colors but no animal/botanical prints like they’ve had in the past. Shout out to the ultra violet patent Jackie I saw, very cool color.

—I finally got to try on the Celine Romy, and the small is very small. The Camille I thought I would love but didn’t. It’s fine, just smaller than I expected (it was the small size to be fair) and didn’t spark joy. 
It’s still very beautiful and stylish just not for me I guess.

—The leather on the Etro Vela is kind of stiff and not very pleasing to touch, also the sales associates at both stores seemed very cagey about letting me touch the clasps which makes me feel like maybe the hardware isn’t very durable. It could have just been the over-the-top Italian sales style though (they like to be overly helpful, it’s too much for me personally). The Saturno bag is very very cute though and the leather pouch feels nicer than the Vela.

—The leather school is Florence is dope. No pushy sales people, it’s actually tricky to try on the bags sometimes because there are few sales people around, but lots of unique and pretty options. Lots of woven leather. Got one for my mom for €275.

—Went to Ferragmo to try on the Soft Hug bag and it is indeed lovely, but fell in love with a gorgeous color blocked Folded Shoulder Bag that I would have loved to buy but wasn’t ready to spend that kind of money on (this was pre-puzzle bag while I was still feeling cheap).

—Tried to go to Bottega Giotti (style precursor to Bottega Veneta), got the name wrong and went to Bottega Fiorentina instead 😂. Priced well at €200-€300 and really cute styles, slightly rougher quality (metal external zippers but plastic internal ones, leather and suede feel a little cheaper). Wasn’t in love but I was being a little unfair because I went there right after Ferragamo and that’s a tough comparison.

—Local Florentine designers: went to Misuri and Cuoi Officine. Misuri has excellent selections from their own line and other Italian designers (almost bought a bag there), CO has a very specific style with marble painted leather that is very cool if you’re into that. Some of the bags even let you switch out the marbleized panels for different looks. Misuri marks up a LOT, like a few hundred euro, so keep an eye out for that if you find a bag you like. My husband found an Il Bisonte bag he liked and saved €300 by going just to the Il Bisonte store down the street.

—Il Bisonte is a very cool brand, it’s a Japanese company but based in Florence, they have a 30km or so supply chain range, meaning they source the leather and make the bags all within that space.
Very rustic style bags, watch out for some of their wallets which are made with genuine leather (so cheap and poor quality) but others are not.

—Braccialini is a very fun Italian brand but their bags are made with genuine leather, so be aware. More style than quality.

—Went into a Prada store just because I’ve never tried on one of their bags and hated the whole experience. They only let you in if they have an available sales person to work with you for every second you are in the store, and otherwise you have to wait outside. I personally hate being hovered over, plus the whole vibe was pretentious and weird. So I am very sorry to report that the Aimee bag is gorgeous and high quality. The Bonnie bag is cute but the leather is very different and not as nice IMO.

1kmceji,handbags,What's your favorite WOC that you can recommend for an upcoming trip that will help keep me organized and fit the necessities?,"Hello! I am considering purchasing a WOC or something of the likes (shoulder/can sit crossbody, preferably a coated canvas) for an upcoming trip. I did a quick search through the sub before posting and did not see options that fit.

I have to pack very smart and light so I'd likely use this as my main bag for the trip. I'd like something that fits a passport, cash, phone, a lipstick, and has slots for my credit card, room card, and health insurance card so I don't have to bring my wallet. I think I'm heading away from WOC territory with these additions, but if I can slide in a thin back up charger and earbuds, bonus points.

Part of the trip will be spent in a city where we will do lots of touring. The bulk of our trip will be spent on a cruise ship so carrying a purse makes little sense. I typically travel with my Speedy 30 and that's much too big.

I'm looking for coated canvas (or a very, very, very durable leather) that can withstand a ton of flying and beating up, and a small chance of snow and rain while on the ship. So nothing too precious, but certainly high quality and nice looking!

This Celine [WOC ](https://www.celine.com/en-at/celine-shop-women/mini-bags/triomphe-canvas/wallet-on-strap-in-triomphe-canvas-and-smooth-lambskin-10D852CG9.04LU.html?nav=A0321-VIEW-ALL)sparked my interest in the first place; I've viewed FLP's and do not love the colors currently available.

1kmbssg,handbags,Just got back from Japan without buying a handbag,"I had been hyping up this trip for months and was expecting to come back buying a few handbags. I had a list of bags I was hunting for. In the end, I didn’t buy any handbags (except for small totes made of canvas and raffia), and I’ll explain why below. 

Here are some things that surprised me, handbag-wise from my trip!

1. The Japanese women I saw didn’t carry a lot of designer bags! I hardly noticed designer bags out in the wild, and most of the time, they were carried by tourists! I noticed that Japanese women almost all carry a canvas tote with them at all times. They look really cute and chic - I ended up buying a few myself. And they are totally inexpensive (like $1-5)!

2. The one designer bag that I noticed the most out in the wild was the Hermes picotin. Saw it in various colours in both size 18 and 22. I can see the appeal of this bag, as it functions as an alternative to the canvas tote bags.

3. The most exotic handbag I saw out in the wild was a dark blue croc Hermes constance at Shibuya crossing. Definitely carried by a tourist, as they had a lot of tax-free shopping bags with them.

4. Social media kind of overhypes the second-hand bag scene in Japan. I shopped the major second-hand designer shops in both Tokyo and Osaka and was very disappointed by the stock. Every store seemed to be carrying the same bags - pristine Hermes quota bags, Chanel, and Louis Vuitton monogram. I was actually on the lookout for an Hermes Plume, vintage Bottega, or vintage Loewe. I guess I thought that the stores would carry the same if not better stock as online marketplaces like Japanese eBay, but that was not the case at all. I guess most of those online stores probably don’t have an actual storefront?

5. Even factoring in the weak yen and the tax refund, the prices of second-hand designer bags in Japan aren’t actually that much better than in Europe. In a lot cases it was more expensive. I live in Europe, and I realised that I could find better deals back home. This was another reason I didn’t end up making any purchases in Japan. But I can see the appeal for tourists from US or other Asian countries faced with higher prices back home. ",2025-05-14 10:30:59+00:00,756,128

Loewe Hammock Hobo - this one is such a cute bag! Love the dark khaki color. Watched a lot of reviews and found out it fits so much. It's also very versatile. I love loewe's leather. I have the original puzzle bag that i bought back in 2018 and it held up pretty well. No peeling at all.

I also want the new chanel hobo bag from their spring-summer 2025 but i think i’ll save that one for december maybe? 🥹",2025-05-14 02:01:14+00:00,7,11

1km1igm,handbags,Help me choose! Celine Camille 16 (Small) or YSL LE 5 À 7 (Small),"Saw and tried both in store and I’m torn! Long story short, I like the design of the Celine Camille 16 more, but not a fan of how thin it is. I have four Celine bags already (plus accessories and SLGs) so not sure if I should diversify my bag collection as well and go with the YSL (aside from it having more space)

Things I took note of while trying in store:

The YSL le 5 à 7 supple (small) can hold more items (full wallet, phone, sunglasses, small makeup pouch, keys, hand sanitizer, a small notebook/book +++), there is a bit of structure at the base but the handles are very floppy, not really a bad thing Overall it's great if you like carrying more things with you without having a bulkier bag (for the small size). The grained leather is soft and makes it a bit more resistant to scratches. Also it currently comes with in color ways compared to the Celine. The logo detail is enough to make a ""subtle statement"", and can match with many outfits. Lining is suede, not the best for stains etc but I like it better than Celine Camille (for the Celine, the lining is lambskin, which is very prone to scratches, something to consider if you like having longer nails)

The Celine Camille 16 (small) I noticed looks better in person than online! Looks very chic, classy, elegant, and understated (the YSL also looks chic but the logo detail makes it a bit more noticeable). Leather is very smooth and feels luxurious, though could be more prone to scratches. It comes with 2 strap options, but I personally think it looks best as a shoulder bag. It is very THIN, only 2 inches depth wise. So you have to be picky with what you put inside (I tested in the store, my phone and tri-fold Triomphe wallet already made the bag bulge, and you have to ""strategically"" place your items, like laying them a certain way and stacking on top of each other to make them fit inside). I think the Black, Tan (brown), and Rice (ivory white) are the better color options, not a fan of the new peach and yellow colors (also the yellow looks quite different in person versus online). I wish they had more colors options.

Thank you!",2025-05-14 00:05:44+00:00,5,9
1km12wl,handbags,Looking for opinions: Best black evening bag – Lady Dior vs. Capucine,"
Hi everyone! I’m looking to add a small black evening bag to my collection—something chic and elegant for date nights with my husband. I want something timeless but also functional enough for a night out.

Today I tried on a few options in boutiques and narrowed it down to:
	•	Small Lady Dior in black with gold hardware
	•	Small Lady Dior in black patent leather with black hardware
	•	New LV “My Capucine” in black with the customizable chain

I absolutely loved the look of both the Lady Dior and the Capucine, but I did notice that the Lady Dior felt a little cumbersome to get my phone in and out of—especially with the top handles and flap. The Capucine felt a bit more flexible and modern, but I’m wondering how it holds up long-term and if it’s just as classic. It’s also about $1000 more! 

Would love to hear thoughts from anyone who owns or has used either of these bags. Do you find the Lady Dior impractical in small size? Is the Capucine as versatile as it seems?

Appreciate any input!

1km028u,handbags,Latigo Chance bucket or Festival tote - opinions,"Running out of time to choose a work anniversary award out of a catalog. Was rather surprised to see purses at these price points in the list, considering a lot of the random household and jewelry options they list are half the retail value of these bags. 

I personally feel I have enough purses right now and haven't bought one in a couple of years to save money. Have always loved the bucket shape and minimalist purses in general and I honestly don't currently own a brown leather purse, other than a tiny crossbody - everything else is black or colored. And my only bucket is much smaller. And covered in a bright colored star print. 

To be completely honest, lately I've been living out of a plain black travel nylon crossbody despite all my pretty purses because switching purses can be a bother. Not worried about always being on trend either. Not even sure what's in fashion this year.

I've never heard of the Latigo brand before. But I have read some positive reviews on here. My options:

1. Chance bucket in brown or cognac. Normally I would gravitate to the dark brown immediately. But maybe the cognac is more versatile?

[https://laticoleathers.com/products/chance-shoulder-bag?variant=41410906325090](https://laticoleathers.com/products/chance-shoulder-bag?variant=41410906325090)

2. Festival tote is also an option in natural or cafe. But I already have a couple of Coach totes and not sure how well it would work as a shoulder bag for someone plus-sized like me. Not a fan of natural but that cafe color is lovely.

3. And this Bianca bag in cognac. But not a fan of the pocket.

1klr8i4,handbags,Songmont Medium Song bag first impressions and thoughts.,"hey everyone!

as promised here is my post in regards to the songmont song bag in medium color : creamy apricot. 

a little back story if you did not read my previous post : i was looking for a bag that gives off similar vibes to the picotin as i had no intention of purchasing the picotin at resellers mark up. 

  
the bag came an hour ago so everything is what i am currently feeling.

ordering, delivery, packaging : ordering the bag was extremely easy. A lot of concerns regarding tarrifs as songmont is a chinese brand, however, i was not charged additional charges. 

i placed the order on friday, requesting next day delivery. The order arrived to me on Tuesday.

packaging : the packaging was excellent and durable. I felt as if they did everything they could to protect my box from damaging. 

i was torn between creamy apricot and the ivory color, i will say the creamy apricot is quite darker than its image, however, i am happy. 

the bag itself is a medium and to me, looks like a medium. I am a mini bag carrier so this bag for me is quite big. If you want this bag but want it to hold additional items (books, ipad, etc) id get the large. 

2nd to last photo shows what fits, and i sitll have ample room in there. I'd also throw in my phone which is the iphone 14 pro. 

the bag comes with an additional pouch/card holder, however, it takes up too much room imo and i will be passing on using it.

last thoughts : i love this bag! i will be adding a nice labubu to it lol to match but other than that i plan on using it all summer.

1klqw2k,handbags,LF bag i saw on the train,"Hi All,

I'm sorry if this is not the place for this, but I'm looking for a bag i saw a woman wear on the train. She got off before i could ask her.
I used a picture of an existing coach bag to help with the description.
It was grey and had a yellow little metal knob on it to twist, but not with a C. My most favorite traits were that it had a zipper to close. The strap was like a belt and get this: the strap that was on the other end and too long could be fastened on the bottom between the protective feet. 
I would love this bag, but I can't find it online..
Does anyone know which one this is?

1klqcp6,handbags,Smaak Amsterdam Tony bag,"Yesterday I went to the Smaak Amsterdam store to look at and potentially buy a Scott bag in Denim color. I ended up buying a Tony in Denim color.

What attracted me to the Scott bag was the handles on the end (really nice design feature, I loved being able to carrry the bag that way, so much more comfortable for me), and the wider shoulder band (more of those, please!), plus the fact that it was just one big empty space for stuff, with a removable inner bag with a zipper. What ended up being the reason I didn't buy it was the shoulder band not being long enough to comfortably carry cross body - I don't like the bag sitting next to my boob, I want it resting on my hip - the inner bag not being very big, despite the dimensions of the bag, and lastly that it was just too open without a proper zipper to close it (magnet is plenty strong though, but not if you fill the bag to the rim), and the final draw: gold hardware, I'm just more a silver girl. Genuinely a wonderful bag in a great size that I would've bought in a heartbeat if it had a longer shoulder band, and a zipper to close.

I ended up buying the Tony, after also having looked at the Ike (a Tony but bigger, just too big for my needs), the Drew (too slim, not enough bottom space and no cross body shoulder band), the Tuur (no crossbody band), and the Marilyn (no carry handles).

The Tony really got me on size, zipper, silver hardware, and that it has a split pocket inside. My old bag (a Gigi Fratelli Rom0157) also had the split inside, but the bag itself was just not big enough to carry all the junk I ~~need~~ want to haul around, although the water bottle is a bit of a pain to zipper over as it's juuust tall enough to be annoying. The Tony also have two smaller pockets on both ends of the bag, each with a magnetic closure. They're tiny though, and I'm not sure what I would use them for, but probably that extra key that's nice to have around, or some other small bits and bops.

The leather is fine (genuine leather according to the tag on the inside, so not top shelf quality). Plenty soft, but definitely not something I'm expecting will last for years and years with heavy use. I think it will eventually scuff and get worn, just like my Gigi Fratelli which are in the same price range, but I'm happy to be proven wrong, and it will instead build patina. The inner viscose liner is suuuuuper soft! I'm definitely a fan of that, and I'm also waiting to see how that holds up.

Overall I'm really happy with my new Tony bag. I think it will treat me nicely for the next few years.

1kln42r,handbags,Luxury evermore,"I would like to inform everyone about my recent purchase with luxury evermore. I was very excited to find this website but have only had a poor and disheartening experience. I would not recommend this site to anyone. I purchased a medium classic flap for my birthday. I spent months searching for the perfect bag and finally made the decision to buy this bag because of the condition that was listed and the reasonable price compared to US prices. When I received the bag I was not pleased with the size of the bag as I have only ever owned a jumbo. I found that the medium was no proportionate with my height / body type. So, I decided to send the bag to rebag in hopes to get my money bag or switch the bag for a jumbo. Rebag let me know that they would not accept the bag as it was heavily repainted! I was in shock. I thought there had to a mistake so I offered the bag to fashionphile. Once again, they would not accept the bag. Finally, I sent the bag to MyGemma and they did not accept the bag and claimed the bag was obviously repainted and did not meet their standards. I contact LUXURY EVERMORE about what had happened and they failed to make the situation right. I initially did not ask for a refund but asked for an exchange in hope to get the right size and give them another chance. I had hoped that this was a mistake or oversight on their part. They refused and offered me a store credit of 75 bucks for my next purchase. This conversation went on for quite some time and they claimed the they did not have to disclose that the bag was repainted and only would accept a refund or exchange if a bag was deemed inauthetic. I am extremely upset about this whole experience and their failure to resolve this the right way. I would have been very happy to receive an exchange and move forward in a positive direction with giving them another chance. Ultimately I believe that many of their bags are repainted due to their significant low prices. Caution to all and please do your due diligence when shopping online. 😭",2025-05-13 14:18:42+00:00,4,2

With all due respect, why should I care about what a social group I'll never even remotely be a part of thinks about how I dress? They're not better than me or born with objectively better taste just because they're wealthy. They just belong to a social stratum that has different customs than mine does. If wearing what I want brands me as upper middle class, so what? I am upper middle class, so pretty much everything else about my lifestyle gives that away.

Why are we putting these people's *alleged* taste on a pedestal? They know who they grew up with. They're not going to think you're one of them because you wear a Celine bag instead of a Goyard. Why even aspire for their approval?

Nevermind that if ""actual rich people"" NEVER wear LV monogram, for example, it either wouldn't exist or it wouldn't cost what it does.

But I feel like perhaps I would wear the micro djoy one more as it's an easy errand bag that I can put on. Wanted any advice you guys may have!  I still want a regular dior because it's so classic, overall just having more trouble which colour and size to get. my other alternative is to get the powder pink in small, but still conflicted if i should get the mini size and then the white micro djoy.

1klamsw,handbags,Designer Bags and Middle-Class Guilt: Anyone Else?,"Feeling a bit conflicted lately. I grew up middle class and have been really proud to build a small collection of designer handbags and wallets through my own efforts and the generosity of my husband.

The thing is, I still feel this weird sense of self-consciousness when I actually use them. Monogram prints especially make me feel like I'm showing off. I'd love to bring my nicer bags to work, but I'm worried about the impression it'll give my colleagues. And around my family, who mostly use brands like Kate Spade and Coach, I'm afraid they'll think I'm being extravagant.

Anyone else feel this way? How do you get over this feeling of being ""too much"" or worrying about what others think?

Edit: Thanks so much for your responses! I'm taking everything to heart and I hope I can muster enough courage to overcome this feeling. ",2025-05-13 02:11:23+00:00,268,126

1kl9eo0,handbags,Quince Handwoven Leather Mini Shoulder Bag -  great travel bag!,"I know Quince has mixed reviews so I want to share my thoughts about this bag in case anyone is interested.


Background: I’m looking for a bag that can lay flat for traveling, can fit a my Kindle and a small water bottle along side my essentials, have both crossbody and shoulder straps, and has zipper. I already have a Uniqlo Round Bag which I love and use daily but want a dressier option!


My frame of reference: I’ve owned and used bags from Gucci, Loewe, Acne Studios, Longchamp, AllSaints, Kate Spade, random Korean bags from WConcept. Nowadays I look for functionality and wearability over brand name, but I mentioned this so that you can see where I’m coming from when reviewing the Quince bag.


My thoughts:

Leather quality: I’m pleasantly surprised! The leather feels very soft and does not smell too chemical. While it’s not the thickest leather out there, it keeps the bag very light even with two straps on. I think the shoulder strap is not as nice as the original Clare V but this is an easy fix (I’m thinking of getting a thicker strap from Amz if I end up needing it). 

Storage: this is the small size but can fit a lot! It’s similar to my Uniqlo Round bag. Obviously it slouches more if you don’t fill it to the rim but the space is there if you need it. Inside there are 3 card slots and 1 zipper pocket, compared to none in the original Clare V design.

Hardware: looks a bit cheap lol. The gold is too shiny for my taste (compared to Gucci gold that I knew). However, for a bag of this price, I’m willing to overlook it. The zipper is moderately smooth.

Strap length: the crossbody at the shortest setting is still a bit long for my short-torso 5’ ass. However, this is an easy fix since I have a leather puncher and can add an extra hole or two.

You can see in my photos it can fit phone, passport, a tin can for my personal stuff, card holder, kindle paperwhite, and a water bottle.

I hope you found the review helpful!!",2025-05-13 01:09:59+00:00,26,1

1kl2q8h,handbags,How much does your body type influence your bag choices (if at all)?,"I was wondering about how much body type and proportions affect people’s bag choices. 
This could be height, weight, curves, whatever.

The usual one you hear is petite people opting for the smaller versions of bags or people with bigger chests having to carefully pick crossbody bags due to strap issues. I was watching a YouTube review where the person specifically said they sold a bag because it didn’t accommodate their large hands well. 

When micro bags were trending a few years ago, I saw people of all shapes and sizes wearing them happily and I don’t exclusively see taller or broader people rocking large bags. I know body type does play a role and you don’t want a bag to throw you off balance, but I don’t think it’s a one size fits all approach (pun intended 😄) or as simple as big with big and small with small. A couple of SAs have steered me to certain sizes based purely on my body type before even asking me what I need the bag for 😆.

I’m also not opposed to purchasing an insert that divides a larger tote like some of these.

But when I received a 16 inch from work, I panicked because the website says the back pocket can fit up to a 14 inch. 

However, the 16 inch can fit perfectly into the main compartment with room to spare (picture 2). I have a personal 14 inch and it does NOT fit into the back pocket though (picture 3). I guess it worked out in the end but surprising that the dedicated laptop pocket can't fit my 14 inch laptop. 

Separately, this is my first Songmont and after months and months of deliberation I pulled the trigger on this and was very pleasantly surprised. The leather is really smooth and feels high quality. It feels very squishy and slouchy with nothing inside. I love the ""shiny"" textured leather on this line and it is so lightweight. I ordered before the price increases and just received it today after 2 weeks to the US.

1kkthzo,handbags,Workbags That Work – What Are the Best Luxury (or Just Smartly Designed) Work Bags You’ve Found?,"Hi Fellow Bag Obsessed! I’m deep in the trenches of finding *the* *perfect* work bag, and I’d love your help.

I’m someone who’s a little bit obsessed with beautiful craftsmanship—think Hermès, Chanel, Loewe—but I also need a bag that’s not just a looker. I’m talking *practical*, *smart design*, and *daily functionality* without compromising on style.

So I want to hear from you:  
✨ What are the best work bags out there—luxury or otherwise?  
✨ If you *love* yours, tell me why! What makes it special?  
✨ If you don’t love yours, what’s missing? What would make it better?

Personally, I wish my current one had:

* A designated upright space for a water bottle
* Easy-access phone pocket (without digging!)
* A proper zipper to keep everything from spilling out when I toss it in the car
* Still look and feel like it belongs on a runway!

Would love your recs, your regrets, your wishlist features—whatever you’ve learned from real-life use. Bonus points for anything that can fit a laptop without turning into a black hole. 👀

Thanks in advance—can’t wait to hear what bags are getting it right!",2025-05-12 14:11:20+00:00,34,50
1kkteym,handbags,Navy is so underrated 💙,"Laid eyes on the side trunk MM in navy and couldn’t look back! Love how it’s a subtle nod towards LV’s heritage with the trunk look and has minimal branding (not a huge monogram/DE girl). Also came with a crossbody strap but I prefer the bag as a top handle/shoulder bag more. The side trunk reminds me of Loewe’s iconic puzzle bag with the boxier look and slouch so definitely why I gravitated towards it too.

It’s surprisingly not a heavy bag with all the hardware and I’ll likely buy protective cover for the bottom edges just to prevent scratches but I do like when bags and jewelry have scratches—adds lived in character plus I don’t plan on selling.",2025-05-12 14:07:49+00:00,488,45

1kkrxw8,handbags,Weekly Questions Thread,"Hey folks! Welcome to the weekly question thread. Going forward for a short  while, we will be having a weekly question thread that will be pinned.  You can ask questions about specific bags that don’t require an entire  review to see if anyone has the answer!

We are doing this so that we can start building up an FAQ so that your  questions can be more easily answered. Questions are NOT restricted to  this post, especially if those questions involve discussions! If you have posted in a previous Weekly Question Thread but your question was not answered, feel free to repost it again. 

Here are some example questions:

1. Can an iPhone 13 Pro fit in the Loewe Mini Puzzle?
2. What bag can I use in the rain under $X?
3. Does this bag match this outfit? (Can be asked in this thread or as a discussion post).
4. Has anyone had any experience shopping at <boutique> in <city>?

Examples of what NOT to post:

1. What bag are you wearing today? (This would be better as a discussion post).
2. Where was your best boutique experience? (This would be better as a discussion post).
3. Review  request for Mlouye! (There’s a chance someone who’s purchased won’t see  it as a comment and may be better off as a post for now).

This thread will be reposted every Monday. You can always revisit any previous [Weekly Question Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/handbags/search/?q=flair_name%3A%22Weekly%20Questions%20%F0%9F%94%AE%22&restrict_sr=1).

I wanted to buy Celine Antoinette a few years ago after seeing it on Angeline Jolie. But I didn’t pull the trigger and this bag serves similar look IMO so I’m glad I purchased this bag!

This sorts as the first time I've ever bought a bag with my own abilities, and even though this bag was expensive for me, I really looked at it for quite a while and compared the prices with Reversible before I decided to go for it. I didn't really understand why it was so expensive, but the style appealed to me so much that I made it a goal to do it, and I got two jobs, one as a teacher on the internet, where I enjoy helping children with their problems and sometimes helping people in other countries with their English, and the other job, as an artist, also on the internet, where I earn money by drawing pictures for other people. I like both jobs very much and they enrich my life and I can reach my goals, I like this life very much! I think making money should go to rewarding myself and getting what I want.

About this bag, I personally find it convenient to hold it or carry it while shopping. Since it's my first time buying this expensive bag, how should I take care of it? My friend told me that I need to take care of oxidization, so how should I store it? Any answer is acceptable to me.",2025-05-12 08:20:34+00:00,5,2

At the end of the semester, a bunch of international girls move out of the dorms and leave behind whatever they don’t want/can’t take back. Someone dropped off a little Coach bag (supposedly) and I found it while organizing the mess that is our lobby right now.

If it helps:
- brown jacquard canvas
- leather bits here and there*
- YKK zipper
- could probably only hold a phone and some essential makeup

The leather bits are a small label on the front that says Coach Leatherware, est. 1941. The inside is just the usual “This is a Coach bag.” The handle, zipper hold and small keychain thing are all leather too. 

I just want to know what kind of bag it’s supposed to be.

Paid $740 USD before taxes. It’s currently €590 on European APC site. 

I was looking for a work bag and this is perfect for me! It’s ludicrously capacious but it’s not obnoxiously large that you’ll hit people on the sidewalk with it. The slouch makes it more compact. Love the double zipper, gold hardware, it’s smooth black leather (I think the smaller sized Veras are all pebbled- I could be wrong). I put a measuring tape for reference and it fits my 13” MacBook horizontally with plenty of room for other stuff. Really nice bag. I’m not sure why the online site says they are made in Portugal; the tag in mine says Made in Morocco. The inside black cotton lined. Really beautiful slouch and the strap is adjustable with a lot of holes, so good for taller and shorter folks. This is a great alternative to the Goyard boheme if you don’t want a printed pattern but very similar style and slouch.",2025-05-12 02:01:56+00:00,18,3

My #1 choice is probably YSL clutch (that I can add a chain to) or pouch, just because I don’t have a bag from them yet, but I like the price point of the quiet luxury bags better 🙃 I also like the Loewe puzzle bag but I read that it’s not really an evening bag style.

1kk9krl,handbags,Hobo Large Vida Tote,"Coming back to review the bag I choose after extensive research fatigue.

I was looking for a professional laptop bag that was leather, that could fit a 15.6” laptop, external monitor, and bonus points if I could bring my external keyboard. Also wanted it structured enough to stand on it’s on, had a zipper or magnet closure, comfortable shoulder straps, and that also had a trolley sleeve. 

I liked the Coach Hadley but it was too small and didn’t have a lot of the features I wanted, I looked a lot at Cuyana’s double loop satchel and the Mila satchel but they were just too big.  My friend has the oversized double loop and it’s just too floppy to stand on its own with a laptop and external monitor. I found several other bags posted in this sub but none that jumped out at me. 

Purchased the hobo vida and am so glad I did!  It fits everything!  Not pictured here but it fits my laptop and external monitor in the back section.   

Including a picture of what I pack day to day where I can keep all the small items like pens, lipsticks, etc in the internal pockets and when I travel when I move all loose smaller items to a zippered pouch.  It does get heavy but the trolley sleeve is amazing. 

I commute by car and visit clients multiple times a week. I prefer to use my own keyboard and mouse for longer periods of use and this tote also fits my 17” keyboard!  When I travel, the keyboard and mouse goes in a case in my carryon luggage.  

I am so happy with my purchase!  The leather is beautiful!  I have a few other accessories from them like cosmetic pouches and they have all held up so well!",2025-05-11 19:47:40+00:00,6,1

1kjyifn,handbags,Is the longchamp L pilage bag no longer available in ebony (dark brown)???,"Hiya! 

I have been wanting a longchamp bag for the longesttttt time, and I was thinking of asking for it for my birthday for next year of school. I remember when I last looked the bag was available in dark brown (ebony), and honestly the colour is gorgeous!! 

The thing is, I can’t find it on their website. Someone posted on this subreddit about it 10 months ago actually, and a commenter mentioned it should still be available in France, so I had a look on the French website but it also does not offer the bag in dark brown. I have found it on eBay and there seems to be a dupe for it by Ariadné, but idk if that’s a trustworthy website or not.

**Loewe Puzzle Fold Pouch in Dark Burgundy** \- I think this is adorable but it looks quite small. It also looks unspecial in its unfolded form.

**Polene Numero Dix in Black Cherry** \- Also cute and the least expensive option!

1kjrqhc,handbags,wore her out for the first time! i understand now why she’s such a classic.,"the sun is coming out to play recently, so say hello to my Gucci Jackie medium in orange python! everyone has the small or mini one, but i’m a big boy and LOOOVE the size of the medium. she feels so substantial and i love how much it makes the python print pop. i love exotics and this bright orange (one of my fave colors) made buying this a no brainer.

my arm’s too fat to use just the shoulder strap as it digs into my armpit, but i really like where the bag hits on me using the extender strap (i’m 5’6” and the extender strap is the shortest it can be, except for being attached to the original strap at the middle loop). i’ve attached the Coach New York cluster charm, but we’ll see if it stays; i like them, but i’m still playing around with how i want to style this purse and what vibe she’s giving.

didn’t feel like she fully matched the vibe of my outfit today, but i tried to pair the orange with a light blue top and dark navy shorts and was happy with the color coordination. i’ll have to see what else i can really pair her with to make her shine.

anyone else have a Gucci Jackie they’ve been loving recently? as much as there’s disarray about the current state of Gucci, i just think you can’t go wrong with their classics. ",2025-05-11 03:33:30+00:00,993,75

1kjo7pk,handbags,Speedy 30 soft dark over monogram 30 Bandoliere - worth it??,"Sorry for the long post ahead 

I’m really stuck in decision paralysis regarding if the speedy 30 soft specifically in the dark is worth it over the regular monogram 30B. I know the regular 30B strap can be made into a shoulder one (I’ve been using my speedy 25B in DE this way) 

The main thing drawing me is the fact that it’s monogram with the black leather. I absolutely love this combo and don’t have anything with this. I also like the luggage tag and chain accessory (don’t care for the tassel) BUT that said, the price difference is really insane lol. I know the soft is lined with leather but tbh that’s not really a draw to me bc it’s inside the bag, so not like it’s being seen. I also like that the black leather is way more care free than vachetta (only monogram is a contender either way since I have the 25b in DE)

Another thing drawing me to the soft is that the shoulder strap doesn’t have any buckles like the bandoliere does. I’ve noticed in using my speedy 25B (as short shoulder or longer) sometimes the buckle catches my hair, so I have to be cautious of that, but obviously not a deal breaker since I do enjoy my speedy 25. 

Another pro for the soft is I kinda like that without the shoulder strap it looks like a more traditional speedy since it doesn’t have the side pieces of leather. 

A pro for the bandoliere is it does have the option to be crossbody if necessary. I never wear my 25 crossbody nor would I with a 30 but thinking in terms of travel, crossbody can be handy for moments when you just need to move quick and be hands free. 

Is the speedy 30 soft really worth it over the 30B? For sure the largest factor to me is that it’s black leather but is that really worth it? lol I know worth is subjective but hoping to get some opinions from those of you who have both (even if you have the soft in the other versions).

Pic 1 - Cyme mini in Ebony
Pic 2 - Numero Un Nano in Chalk
Pic 3 - Numero Un Nano in Taupe
Pic 4 - Cyme mini in Camel

What I ended up buying: Cyme mini in Ebony

Overall impression: The brand and this bag in particular lives up to the hype for me. It’s probably not a classic and more leaning towards a trendy bag but for this price point I’m not mad about it! 

2-3 days of carrying the Cyme Mini in Ebony and so far so good! Love the size, the convenience of shoulder-carry-style. The bag itself is structured leather but the little pouch that came with it is actually soft leather which is a nice little touch. I love this bag proportion for easy access to my things and it fits all my essentials (cardholder, a6 hobonichi, 2x pouches, and a jellycat drink holder). The bag fits well under my arm, it’s also very light and I can even carry it around the playground chasing my kids. 
The only thing that is a bit annoying is the bag doesn’t stand upright on its own. 

But overall I really like this bag! 

Store experience: I finally made it to the NYC store (I live in Queens and sometimes it feels like it’s a hike to get into Manhattan). Tried on all the bags that I had been looking at online and came home to order the mini cyme in Ebony which arrived a few days later. My next one will probably be Numero Un Nano or the Mokki Mini (didn’t take any pictures) for a summer crossbody bag. 

This was last Sunday and it was pouring rain a bit. I had to wait outside for a few minutes (under cover) since the store was full. Once I got in I was left alone to try on all the bags that I wanted to try on from the shelves (which was what I much preferred) . When I didn’t see the color that I wanted, I asked and was helped by a really nice gentleman who brought it out from the back for me to try. I was in and out within 15 mins! Overall the experience was great and I thought the bags were beautiful in person and sturdy and nice to touch, hold and wear. 

Online experience: They didn’t have the Cyme Mini in Ebony in store (the one I tried was for display only) so I ended up ordering it a few days later. the bag was delivered within 3-4 days and arrived in a delivery brown box, inside was another white box, some paper stuffing, care cards, etc. Bonus, no taxes! 

Some notes on the Bags I tried on: 
Cyme mini in camel - this color was really beautiful and I would probably normally go for this color if I wasn’t specifically looking for a dark brown bag to go with my camel trench. 

Cyme mini in Raffia - this bag is really pretty and would look great for a summer bag! The side doesn’t clench in though in case you were wondering! 

Mokki mini in Chalk - this bag was surprisingly mini (in a good way!) it’s a bulky and structured and looked great on a petite frame. 

Numero Un Nano in Chalk - this color is cooler than I expected, it looks very similar to Taupe and I wonder if I should go for taupe for a summer bag that is a bit more forgiving in terms of maintenance. 

Hope this was helpful in some ways!

The kit was $65, so I thought “why not? Let’s see how identical it is to my Burberry”. And damnit it’s the exact same bag, minus the quality and the inside lining. 

Google “handbag kit” if you want to start to learn leatherworking :) 

(just an FYI, the dupe kits are poor leather/hardware/string but a FANTASTIC way to learn bag making) ",2025-05-10 21:57:53+00:00,54,5

1kjgemb,handbags,What are your thoughts on contrast stitching?,"For those who aren't familiar: contrast stitching is when the thread of the bag is a different colour than the leather.

I noticed a post in which a bag had contrast stitching, and saw surprisingly a few negative reviews in regard to it. This isn't my first time seeing people share the same opinion, however.

I was quite surprised because I never really thought much of contrast stitching. I never really thought it looked bad, and at times, if the stitching is even (perfect) it may help enhance a bag. I might be bias because I make my own bags, however.

Anyhow, what are all your thoughts in regards to contrast stitching?  Do you love it? Hate it? Are neutral about it? :) all opinions are welcomed!

Hi everyone, I’m hoping someone can help me understand what I can do. I bought a Goyard bag in Milan, Italy and processed the VAT refund through Planet Tax Free. My point of exit from the EU was Vienna, Austria. At the Vienna airport, I got my Planet Tax Free form customs validated (scanned) at the kiosk, and I was told my items were validated.

However, I just realized I forgot to drop the physical Planet Tax Free form into the designated box before leaving. Now, it’s been a few days and I haven’t received any refund yet. I also checked the Italian customs portal, and it still says ND (Not Delivered).

Strangely, I also had items under Global Blue, and even though I also forgot to submit those forms, I already received the Global Blue refund.

Is there still a way for me to get my refund? I also am trying to email Planet Tax's Customer Service. 

Thanks in advance for any advice!

* chapstick
* a few pens

The Kipling Gunne (22 x 16 x 6 cm) seems like the perfect size, but I would love to find something nicer looking and maybe less brand-y. Tumi Persia seems about right too, but I am pushed away by that price for a non-leather bag.

But the purple one that Carrie wears was never an option for me as it’s not my usual color scheme. 
Also I preferred the newer Baguette since they have the removable straps to prevent the shoulder strap from breaking up, compared to the older models. 

So for a long time I’ve been checking the Fendi website regularly for new models but I always thought they were never worth enough to spend 3k+ and keep for a long time. 

I have been back and forth with a Fendi SA to find my perfect baguette. Some Baguette I really liked were almost every time from the hand in hand collection and worth 10k +, some even 20k +. 

Then I flew to Seoul for vacation and went to the lotte mall there. One friendly SA there showed me this mini model with this brown sequin which took my breath away instantly. I had seen this version on the website before but seeing it with your own eyes was so insanely pretty and sparkly. 

The Seoul SA ordered my baguette to be picked up a week later. And there she is! Took her immediately out to the Dior exhibition. And I pulled so many looks! Usually Koreans wear minimalistic and cute bags so mine really shines out! 

Also got such a better deal buying it in Korea than my home country. With the weak Korean currency rates ant tax refund I almost saved 600€.

At this point, LVMH just has someone watching Tanner's reviews and are buying minority stakes in whatever brand they want, absorbing them into the LVMH portfolio or one of its subsidary companies and enshittifing their products and designs.

Delvaux bags are always a work of art, but this spring collection is absolutely stunning! It is inspired by the Art Nouveau, so there are lots of dreamy florals —including lambskin crafted flowers on bags, and some very limited hand painted Brilliant bags. Some of the other highlights were the embroidered Tempête Small with the NYC skyline—it really looks like you’re flying over the city at night. And the darling Sweet Daisy embroidery work in the Brilliant and Pin bags. 

The store event was as blooming and fun as the collection—Anna Wintour even stopped by one day and gave the displays her thumbs up approval. I wore my Nuages Magritte limited edition mini Brilliant to the event (it’s been one of my go-to bags since I received it this year), and had an amazing time visiting with the fun Delvaux team, and was given a lovely scarf as a gift. I love Delvaux bags—every bag in this collection is so beautiful though that I haven’t decided what to get first: the tulip Brilliant (it’s nearly sold out worldwide so hurry if you’re interested in it), a handpainted Brilliant, or a *porcelain ceramic* micro Toy 💐 ",2025-05-09 23:48:17+00:00,99,13

1kip8vb,handbags,Vintage Bag - vinyl or leather?,"
So I found this cool bag at an estate sale/online auction. It was described as black leather. The brand is Astrid. I loved that it has an alarm clock in it. I figured it was from the 50’s or 40’s because that is when Rensie watch/clock company seemed to be active. I was first trying to find out more about the super cool imbedded alarm clock but that was kind of a dead end. Watch forums can’t decide if it was a line of export only watches from a Swiss company or if it was from a West German company founded by a guy named Eisner that just spelled his name backwards who sourced most of his parts from Switzerland and put them together in Germany. Anyway, once I received the bag, the “leather” is very stiff and plasticy feeling so I was trying to figure out if it was vinyl or truly leather. The only place where I could feel the backside of it was where the watch opening is and it feels suede-like but I am still not sure. It doesn’t smell like plastic and only faintly leathery. Where it has deep folds on the sides, there are no creases as you would expect from vinyl. I only found one other “Astrid” bag on ebay and it is described as Saffiano leather. I did clean it and there was some dye transfer. Would that only be from leather? I also realize someone may have used shoe polish on it at some point so it could also have been that. I am still not sure- is there any other way I can test to see if it’s leather outside of burning it 🔥. Although now that it’s clean and deodorized, I am not sure I care that much either and will add it to my collection of odd handbags. But I am curious.

Eclipse is a very deep navy. 

It’s a two compartment bag, can be crossbody, it “gives Birkin and Balenciaga Rodeo” as one of my colleagues said but at a much lower price. The front compartment is the one with the closure, the back is open but has a zipper compartment. Will take about 3 months and cost $200 more than the regular version.

Everywhere I look, it's just not the shade of pink I'm looking for or I'll find the shade but won't like the bag 😭. 

I used to loathe the color pink. Never cared for anything pink. From clothes, makeup, nail polish, accessories, etc, I hated pink. Until one day, I started dreaming of *everything* in pink then found out the reason why women begin to like pink again and it's 100% true. 

But I can't find the pink anywhere! It's truly disappointing and frustrating and I'm at the point of wanting to make my own, which, likely I would start the project then stop midway.

1kih0ex,handbags,Time Resistance - I'm in love!!,"I learned about this brand accidentally through just googling for a nice barrel bag. I discovered the Little Dorrit and just \*fell in love\* with the red. 

  
Received it a little while ago and, I must say, I'm in LOVE! The leather is soft and supple, while still retaining a sense of thickness, sturdiness, and shape. It came in a beautiful black box (gorgeous opening experience!) and pressed down, which alarmed me at first... but it straightened it out with ease and I really got a feel for the sturdiness of the leather. No creases! After a while in shipping! It also came with a personally signed quality assurance check with name, and a note on how it had been treated with their brand of balsam right before shipping. It all felt so personal and luxurious.

It is a gorgeous, vibrant, rich colour (glossy rather than matte, for those interested, but not super glossy... the slight shine on the pictures online are very accurate). I'm sure it'll scratch and develop a patina, and the notes by the company said to expect that, alongside that their bags are made to wear like that, so I feel quite reassured. It smells great, feels great, and fits EVERYTHING while not feeling overly full. I feel both refined and adorable when wearing it--somehow! 

  
I am just so impressed by this brand and had to write about it. Utterly in love, and I'm now in the process of checking out all their other items now! Absolutely gorgeous. ",2025-05-09 12:15:35+00:00,34,8

1kib8ts,handbags,Help! Should I have the strap design changed? Parisa Wang Grace convertible backpack,"I am in love with this bag for its design that allows me to EASILY convert it between a backpack and a shoulder/sling bag. But the design increases the wear and tear of  the straps especially the part that comes in contact with the metal ring at the back. (Photos for reference)

Do you have any tips on how to protect this part of the strap? 

I know that having it regularly repaired professionaly will not address the issue because it will keep getting twisted when I wear it as a backpack, which is 95% of the time I use this bag. 

I'm planning on having the straps cut, then permanently attached to the two rings at the back to prevent further damage to the leather. The bottom part of the straps are unfortunately not detachable so I can't easily replace the straps.

I would appreciate any tips and suggestions. Thanks!",2025-05-09 05:48:24+00:00,3,1

1ki9kun,handbags,Cleaning a Tory Burch Ella Tote,"Hi everyone! I’ve been using my beloved Tory Burch Ella tote for a few weeks. I noticed today a little grease stain on the inside pocket and was wondering if anyone had any advice on how best to clean it? I tried to soak it up with baby powder but that didn’t do anything. I tried before to remove another grease stain that made the pocket weird (both stains in pic). The bag is like 100% polyester and faux leather (it’s pretty durable). Or am I stuck with these stains? The first stain was Italian dressing and the recent stain was from my sunscreen stick.

I had a mini backpack but it was too small so I ordered the original size.. wasn’t in love with the color so I sent that one back and ordered another one and now I’m waiting for that one to come and I’m having second thoughts. 

I like the aesthetic of the backpack and I really like the lightweight aspect and general distribution of backpacks in general. The straps don’t bother me at all, and i find it to be generally comfortable. 

All I can think about is how other people might perceive me while carrying the bag.  

Someone recently asked me if I was a college student while carrying the one I had sent back and I can’t stop thinking about it. Not that being perceived as college student would be a negative thing.. I am just not.

1ki3bl5,handbags,Is it Crazy to Own Two Neverfulls? Help Me Decide!,"
To my fellow LV lovers: I’m in a bit of a dilemma and could really use some advice from you.

I recently (and finally) made my first luxury bag purchase after a decade of dreaming about owning an LV. This wasn’t an impulse buy. I’ve wanted an LV bag for a long time. And after finally being in a place where I’m making big girl money I can finally afford them, so I went for it! 

Here’s the situation: I bought not one, but two neverfulls…Yes, two! 
Because I loved both and couldn’t just settle for one. I got one in monogram and the other in damier ebene both mm. I genuinely love both for different reasons. Monogram is iconic and girly, and DE is cool-girl coded and carefree. 

So now that I have both. I’m feeling a bit of buyer’s guilt. I make good money. But I’m not filthy rich, and my gut tells me it’s a little insane to have two neverfulls. I feel like I should be more minimalistic, sensible and mindful with my collection. But I also know I’d miss the one I return back to LV.

Should I keep both and build my collection slowly around them, or should I return one and focus on loving one for now? I haven’t used any of them yet. I put them on my shelf side by side. I tell myself maybe if I look at them hard enough I might be able to decide. Lol. 

Would love to hear your thoughts, especially if you’ve been in a similar situation. Do you think it’s overkill to keep both, or is it smart to own both iconic LVs?

Thanks in advance for your advice!

I already have a few (Chanel and Prada), but I’m looking for something a bit more simple/casual without the big logos but in a timeless design and great quality. Also, all my bags are black, so think I need to increase my color tones to include either green or burgundy (love them both dearly).

-ideally silver hardware but I’ll cave on this one if everything else fits
-budget <$700

the closest I’ve found is the Grafea heart satchel which I might go for, but the only thing that’s making me hesitate is that I’m not sure if I’m crazy about the fact that there’s no slip pockets on the inside (I think? it just says 1 main compartment)… so I want to try and find something that feels totally right before I decide to go for the Grafea one!

Both bags are black, but one has a supple grained leather and the second one has a soft grained leather.

1) which is softer? In terms of “keeping fit”, for example, if not much things placed inside

I’m looking for ideas or recommendations for a black leather clutch or evening bag. I’d like something quite minimalist – ideally with little or no visible branding – and a timeless design. I'd like something well made, great quality materials. It needs to be just big enough for the usuals (phone, lipstick, a bank card or two).

The challenge is that a lot of the options I’ve seen have huge logos or very obvious branding, which I’d prefer to avoid. I’d love to hear suggestions – both from big fashion houses and more niche or under-the-radar brands.

Budget is up to €1500, but I’m also open to second-hand pieces (so if you have recommendations for more expensive RRP bags that I might be able to find second hand, please also share). I’m based in Europe, in case that makes a difference.

1khkxql,handbags,Help choosing a card case wallet!,"My current wallet is too bulky and I really want a slim card case when I’m only carrying a few cards or when I’m wearing a smaller purse. I’ve been trying to decide on what type of card case wallet to get for a few months but it’s been difficult to decide. I’ve been thinking it over for awhile and I know these are my absolutes:
- I don’t want a card case with the brand name spelled out on it. Logo is okay if I like the way the design is added
- I want a card case with good leather. So I was looking at Loewe and Bottega

I know it would be more practical for me to get a card case that isn’t black, since I sometimes have a hard time locating my black wallet in my bags and often have to resort to “feel” to find it. But I also love the look of so many black wallets, especially the black bottega card cases. Though, I do need a card case that’d be identifiable at first glance. 

I really love the look of bottega card cases, but the only non-black option they have is this cream wallet and I’m not sure how I feel about it. I like the brown and olive green bottega wallet colors too but it isn’t available at the site I’m purchasing at. 

For another non-black option, I love the red loewe anagram card cases but I still feel hesitant about it for some reason. Probably because I don’t have a lot of popping colors like this red so I’m not used to it. ",2025-05-08 08:20:22+00:00,7,6

I'm looking to internationally ship my vintage bags that all up probably cost me 1.5k. The commercial (original price) or 'market value' (typical resell) far exceeds what I actually paid. Most of these bags were gifted/bought thrifted and secondhand (there's just a lot, my full collection) - and most are are in used condition, none brand new or with tags. 

Has anyone had experience with customs declaring these below assumed value? Did you have to submit paperwork detailing exactly what you paid? I don't want to get flagged to verify costs as for many I don't have it, as some were purchased 10+ years ago. Would they even believe when I said I thrifted them? What do I do? I will have to pay import duties as the parcel is still considered over the low cost goods threshold  regardless.

This is my first chain bag so I’m not sure if heavy or light is better. The oak color is interesting. It seems like it is one color with another painted over it. I was expecting it to be more like one solid color. I do have a vintage Mulberry in black that I’ve loved forever. The leather feels different on this one, but maybe it will be more scratch resistant. I’ll be reaching out to customer service to see what I can do about the damage.

On the other hand, I have a bag from Madewell (pictured on the left) that works seamlessly with both my dressier outfits and my everyday casual looks.

I'm torn—should I keep the Strathberry even though I likely won’t reach for it often? Maybe reserve it as a dedicated spring/summer dressy bag? It pairs wonderfully with my ""date night"" clothes 😏 I’m still relatively new to handbags (started collecting about 2 years ago) and trying to be intentional with building a versatile, well-rounded collection—nothing high-end or designer.

Its a little short in terms of length but thats actually perfect if you want to cinch in the straps as it creates a more rounded bottom.
Also if you want some structure to carry the flamenco as a clutch.. the base of the insert is sturdy enough to hold onto.

Which bag are you all carrying today? 🥰

1khahxd,handbags,Thoughts on this Mulberry Small Bayswater in dark Olive Embossed Leather?,"Hi all,
I recently bought this 2019 Mulberry Small Bayswater in olive green embossed leather from FARFETCH. It was listed as “like new” and came in excellent condition—smelled great, no wear at all. It also has free returns, so I can still send it back.

This is my first Mulberry bag, and while I initially loved the color and structure, I’m now unsure. The olive green and the embossed leather feel a little… dated? I can’t tell if it’s timeless or just old-looking.

What do you think of this style and color in 2025? Would you keep it?",2025-05-07 22:27:00+00:00,6,5

1kh6b39,handbags,First designer bag purchase - analysis paralysis,"Celebrating a recent promotion, I decided I wanted to treat myself to a higher end (or at least, higher than I've ever purchased) bag.

I'm a new mom and I'd like something that combines chic, modern design with practicality. I'd also like to get a matching wallet if I can afford it before de minimis ($800). I've narrowed it down to 4-5 crossbody-style bags — I need my hands free — and would love to get some feedback if anyone has experience with any of them. This is an investment for me, and I don't want to buy something that's going to fall apart or look scratched up in 6 months of wear.

In any design, I'm looking for a black bag with gold hardware. I like a lot of Le Tanneur's designs and they seem to consistently be praised, so there's a lot of that here.

[Le Tanneur Rose (medium or small)](https://www.letanneur.us/products/sac-bandouliere-moyen-modele-rose-en-cuir-lisse) \- sophisticated design, but has smooth leather, which I fear will scratch. I also love the functionality of a top handle. Also a little pricy, and I could probably only get the bag, no wallet

[Le Tanneur Ella (medium) ](https://www.letanneur.us/products/ella-medium-crossbody-bag-grained-leather-black)\- love the extra strap... this bag basically checks all the boxes, but the design looks more classic than sophisticated. I think the leather would hold up well though

[Le Tanneur Naya (small)](https://www.letanneur.us/products/naya-small-leather-shoulder-bag-cork-effect-black?variant=46847234572626) \- sleek design, looks like it can be worn on the shoulder or as a crossbody. I just wish it had a little something extra and it does appear to be a little small

[Leo et Violette Gianni](https://www.leoetviolette.com/en-us/products/le-gianni-noir-liege) \- love the locking clasp and balance of classic and sophisticated design elements. Not sure about the quality of the leather and if it will scratch easily. No matching wallet

[Leo et Violette Nova](https://www.leoetviolette.com/en-us/products/le-nova-noir?_pos=8&_sid=0756e7df7&_ss=r) \- I like the design of the gianni a bit better but I love this one too and thing the matching wallet is a nice touch. Again, not sure about leather quality and durability

I found this bag at a consignment shop last weekend in Carmel by the Sea.

More details: It’s beaded and has tassels and beaded fringe areas, as you can see in the image. The interior is lined with silk and appears to be quite old based on the print and wear. The chain and bangles also seem to be quite old but are in good shape.

Turned out I became a little bit bored and needed something new and fresh. Recently, I bought a beautiful suede tote from ASOS that was about 90€.

Personally, I’m torn between the Quercia pockets and oskan hobo but can’t pick. I think the oskan hobo will age better and looks more classic but looks like it can’t hold a lot.

1kgob3g,handbags,Looking for a Laptop/Work bag for corporate girly life,"**Hi everyone!**

Please forgive me, I don't really know much about bags but I recently landed my first internship and wanted to treat myself to a cute and functional school/work bag! I’ll be commuting, so I’m looking for something that can comfortably carry my 14"" laptop, a water bottle, and other daily essentials.

A friend recommended the **Samo Ondoh Cross Utility Work Bag**, and while I love the look (it’s super cute!), I’m a bit unsure about its durability. The straps seem a little thin for carrying heavier items like a laptop and water bottle but I'm not sure to trust my expertise.

So I wanted to ask:

* Does anyone own this bag and have thoughts on how it holds up for daily use?
* Are there any other bags you’d recommend that are **affordable**, **durable**, **functional**, and have a **similar aesthetic**?
* Also, is artificial leather a good material choice for long-term use? I’ve seen mixed things online and I’m not sure what’s best.

Thanks so much in advance! I really appreciate any guidance!

i saw this used tsuchiya kaban tote leather bag in a local online selling plaform in our country. it was being sold for 25 us dollars.

i am not really familiar with the brand but i did saw some listings online, some were priced at 90 to 100++ usd.

it has the markings of the original tsuchiya bag and a tag (which needs some fixing as well), so i assume that it's the original. the inside is also clean. no bad smell, no mold. the buckles are also in pristine condition. 

the bag seems to hold up well despite some aging and creases. it also looks dry and deformed, but i feel like its not something that can be fix. 

my mom thinks its too worn out.
lol.  i mean, this old bag maybe wrinkled, weirdly shaped, possibly held together by luck, but i feel like it can still get  the job done. lol

i'm a bit rugged myself, so this bag complements my style.

I am 6ft and broad shouldered. Don’t love super teenie bags or super wide bottoms. A top handle with a crossbody hates to see me coming.

1kga6bs,handbags,Tips Please - Prada Aimee vs Loewe Puzzle Featherlight,"TLDR: which bag would you recommend? Prada Aimee (medium) vs Loewe Featherlight Puzzle?

I’ve been into the Puzzle for a while now and even got a black Horse Clementine as a sort of training-wheels version to further confirm if I’d like a bag that shape. When the Puzzle Featherlight came out, I was nervous about the durability of the soft leather, but couldn’t deny that I liked the features. I wanted it as an everyday bag and was torn between black and Pecan, but I’m currently set on the Pecan as I don’t have any bags in that color.

I thought I was decided but I recently saw someone with the Prada Aimee in Caramel and now it’s tempting me as well! Both bags seem to be in similar camps so it’s either one or the other for me.

Could anyone with experience with either or both bags give me tips on which you would pick?

They’re both relatively new bags so online reviews are limited.

My main concerns are: look, versatility,  durability(I do not baby my bags) and longevity (of style). Although the Aimee is about 1/3 cheaper than the Featherlight, neither is “cheap” so I want to get it right 🤞

Thanks! 🤎

I usually carry just an iPad, a book, some pens, and a few beauty essentials - no laptop.

Both bags are under $150, which fits my budget. I want something modern, stylish, durable, and able to handle rough use. My main concern with the Phoebe Tote is that it does not zip shut. Will it look awkward if it's messy inside, or will it be impractical if I get caught in the rain?

If you have experience with either bag, I would love your thoughts! Also open to other suggestions - but not a fan of the Longchamp look, even though I know it's a popular choice.

The leather version still has the little tabs on the sides…so I made the modification myself 😊 
I bought the screw D rings from Amazon and a black strap from Poshmark. It’s not perfect, the D ring gold is a little rosier, but it’s good enough for me. If it bothers me I may eventually go to a cobbler to get them to install matching gold rings. I’m so pleased with my new bag! I also got an interior organizer that sort of distorts the bag’s shape but it has a zipper top so that has made the bag so much more functional for me as well.   
I don’t use the crossbody strap primarily, but it sure is nice to have sometimes! I can’t figure out why they would offer the crossbody on the ones with the colored fabric on the reverse but not the ones with leather. 🤷🏻‍♀️ ",2025-05-06 13:00:12+00:00,10,4

I know there have been a lot of issues lately with quality but I have to say I’m very pleased with this bag. 

I own a Neverfull GM and she’s been a work horse for 8 years. So I’m excited to have what I hope is another bag I don’t have to baby. I traded my Chanel Deauville to purchase this because I never used it and it was so worried about getting g the baby blue dirty. 

I also added the stripe and patch to make it a little personal. And now I just need to find a scarf that I like. 

Also, while cleaning and going through my bags I found the receipt from 2017 for my Neverfull for $1300 🫠🫠 so that was fun.

1kg3nz9,handbags,Decided on the Flamenco - but which color?,"Hi everyone.

I have finally decided on purchasing the Loewe mini flamenco together with a donut strap.  Problem is that there is no Loewe store nearby and I'm not able to see any of the color options in person. 

I would love a neutral color that is not black, but still versatile enough for both everyday and a dinner out. My wardrobe is basically only neutrals and basics and I already own a few brown and tan bags. Everybody keep saying the Loewe colors are so unique and rich. 

The colors on my list are the Dark Khaki (this is the one I'm leaning towards for now), the Abyss Blue and somehow the Warm desert also speaks to me. 

Have any of you bag lovers seen the Loewe Abyss Blue color in person? It looks really vibrant and bright on some pictures and more neutral  on some pages. Convinced that the Abyss blue would look so chic with the silver chain.. The Dark Khaki also looks gorgeous, but does it stand out? 

The Desert brown seem to be a real Loewe classic, but not sure if it is the best day to night color, and a bit to mustard like for my taste. 

Please share your opinions and help me chose",2025-05-06 12:50:47+00:00,95,92

1kfzphc,handbags,[Advice] Birthday Bag Help! Tory Burch Eleanor vs. Coach Tabby vs. Marc Jacobs Tote Small (Open to Suggestions!),"Hey lovely bag lovers! 👛✨

With my birthday coming up, I’m looking to treat myself by adding a new piece to my small but growing handbag collection. I’ve only started building it recently, and I’d really appreciate your thoughts to help me decide on my next bag!

Right now, I’m torn between these three options:

* **Tory Burch Small Eleanor Bag** – love the classy vibe, but not sure about the practicality.

https://preview.redd.it/u8f8u83bk4ze1.png?width=477&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fa2ca10446a74a12c013b5e026f7e31f81779c1

* **Coach Tabby (probably the 26)** – super chic, versatile, and seems like a fan favorite.

* **Marc Jacobs Tote (Small)** – feels trendy and functional, but I wonder if it aligns with my style long-term.

https://preview.redd.it/5ddaq7kkk4ze1.png?width=315&format=png&auto=webp&s=53e7a6a1d87bf1e6eb0dfa5d52121ab428f7a120

I’m specifically looking for a **classy yet affordable crossbody or shoulder bag**. Something that complements what I already have, but brings something a little new to the mix.

Here’s my current collection:

* **LV Neverfull**
* **Gucci Marmont Super Mini**
* **Marc Jacobs Snapshot**
* **Coach Colorblocked Field Tote**
* **Michael Kors Voyager (Classic)**
* **MK Jet Set Crossbody**

This group pretty much defines my style — I’d say I lean toward **structured, clean lines with a mix of timeless and modern touches**.

I’d love to hear what you all think of the three options I’m considering. Also, if you have suggestions *outside* of these, I’m all ears! Budget-wise I’m hoping to stay under $500–600.

Thanks so much in advance for your help 💛",2025-05-06 08:51:00+00:00,2,5

1kfyd0r,handbags,Oh. My. Gosh!!! I returned and reordered that crappy quality Satchel from Dooney and they sent me the EXACT same bag again!,"I am so beyond aggravated. I returned the one from my post last month (https://www.reddit.com/r/handbags/s/UnPfpA7Wq0) and reordered again because D&B said they don’t do replacements. So I had to return the poor quality bag and then order again. Well I just opened my new bag and they sent me the same stinking bag! The leather lines are identical. Some are more smoothed out, partially because they overstuffed the bag with wrapping this time. They did clean off the glue from the stitching areas, but the leather is still heavily textured, the logo is scrunched, and the edges are jagged. What was once a reliable brand has certainly shattered its image with me. And don’t get me started on their horrible customer service. If you’re lucky enough to be able to successfully send an email, don’t expect to be able to respond to their reply. I get persistent “inbox full” responses. And as another person pointed out, the leather doesn’t smell like leather anymore. More like paint mixed with something similar to leather. Sad this brand isn’t going to last at this rate. @PeterDooney, I hope you can step in here and fix a reputation your team is destroying.  Completely unacceptable from a somewhat luxury brand. I wonder how long this bag has been in circulation. Certainly someone will eventually accept 2nd rate quality. It won’t be me. ",2025-05-06 07:09:02+00:00,278,71

1kfx8fj,handbags,Smaak Amsterdam,"I decided I liked one of the bags during the recent sale on the Smaak Amsterdam site so I ordered the Lotte in the color Pine and because I didn't want to pay for shipping and wanted a white/cream colored bag with silver hardware anyways, I got the Alan in Cream. Both were delivered today, so I'll give my initial thoughts.

Quality on both is ok for the price point, though I don't think I would buy either one at full price as neither are particularly luxurious or high quality. I bought them because I like the style and will use for a bit before passing them along. Both came with crossbody straps and the lining on both bags is a fuzzy polyester. The lining on all 3 Smaak bags is prob the worst part of the bags and cheapens the overall feel of the bags. This was my second shipment from them, so I will also say that the boxes they use for shipping aren't particularly great. Both times, the boxes arrived partially open. Whatever glue used to hold the box together just isn't strong enough to stay completely closed during transit.

 I'll start with my initial impression of the Lotte. It's a surprisingly roomy bag due to the soft slouchy structure of the bag. It has one inner zip pocket and a slip pocket. I can easily fit the same things I fit in the orange Smaak bag I posted about last week into this bag as well, but I would skip the feminine hygeine pouch as this one has an inner zip pocket. The Pine color is kinda a matcha latte type color that I really like. I'd prob use the Lotte in casual settings, without too much worry about scuffs or damage. The shoulder strap on this bag does seem to be adjustable, but I didn't attempt to adjust or remove it since I'm ok with the length it came with. I don't love the way the chain feels on my shoulder, so I may just wear this bag as a crossbody. The bag came with a bit of sticky residue on one of the rings where the crossbody strap attaches, but it was easily cleaned.

The Alan I don't like at all. The bag is small and very rigid and structured with a hard base and the lining doesn't lay flat in this bag. I can fit my small pouch (contains my keyfob, small pillcase, contact eyedrops, and hairties), a slim power bank, card holder, headphones, gum, a lippie, Tide pen, nail oil pen, and a small hand cream. My phone will fit as well, but then the bag feels overstuffed and is difficult to close. I may try to return this bag if it doesn't wind up being too much of a hassle. 

My overall impression of Smaak Amsterdam is that it's ok for the price, but nothing special. I'm satisfied with 2/3 bags I purchased for myself due to the color and overall style, and my mom liked the bag I got her. Depending on how these bags last with use, I may consider buying another bag if it was on sale and I was particularly drawn to the color/style, but at the price range these bags are at, I'd probably prefer to get a bag from Lancaster Paris, which I feel is in a similar price range (maybe a touch cheaper), but feels higher quality.",2025-05-06 05:49:54+00:00,8,2

I only noticed because I did exchange it in the states and it was like factory wrapped with tissue over everything and had no loose stitches etc. I’m going to Europe and likely will purchase another bag (I annoyingly checked and my same bag I got 3 weeks ago is $300 cheaper than wha I paid in Asia and $900 cheaper than in the US) but it got me thinking, are bags made in one place or across the world? Like was it LV or a brand where people were like don’t get the bags made in TX! Was it just random that the bag I got in Asia had issues? Would a bag in Italy be made locally? Better quality?

I held off on buying it because I needed to give the price some thought - this is my first luxury bag purchase! By the time I went back two months later, the bag was not to be found in any store but the salesperson was very nice and tracked it down; there were a few in a warehouse and they were still available. I was delighted and I ordered it; it arrived the other day. But I’m concerned about this weird bump that’s right below the hardware - you can see it best in the picture where I’m holding it. First I through it was the paper stuffing pushing the leather out of shape, but it’s not; the leather is just like that. It almost seems like the leather was tugged out of place. I’m just wondering if this type of thing is normal with even luxury bags? Is this acceptable? I wouldn’t be as bothered if it was a $200 bag, but this was much more costly, and I feel like it looks weird.

1kfq1kx,handbags,Are Louis Vuitton monograms still trendy?,"Considering a purchase of the Speedy 20 as I tried it on in store and it’s the perfect size for my petite frame. I love the idea of throwing everything in it, with just the right amount of space to hold essentials but nothing extra. I’m frequently on-the-go and prefer to change my bags as infrequently as possible. This seems like a good catch-all for day-to-day use.

HOWEVER, I remember when these were big back 15-20 years ago. Do they still hold that same timeless appeal, or are they dated? I know there’s trendier options, but I prefer something I could still use in a similar shape for the next 10-15 and this seems like a safe enough bet🤣",2025-05-05 23:20:05+00:00,0,24

I also received two different dustbags with different material?? kinda of strange since they're the exact same product just in different colors. 🤷‍♀️

Overall happy with both though!

1kfoxbw,handbags,need bag rec for uni,"I’ve had my Longchamp Le Pliage for over 6 years now, and it’s finally given out. The corners are ripped, the handles are super worn, and it’s just not holding up anymore. I was fully ready to repurchase, but not after seeing how quickly my friends' newer ones have ripped corners within a year

What I do love about the Longchamp is the size, how much I can carry without killing my shoulder and the water resistance But I always hated how floppy it was and how it basically needs an organizer for my things to be a mess. It's also annoying to reach the zipper to open when on my shoulder and close.

* Durable (ideally lasts a few years without ripping)
* Water-resistant or waterproof
* Comfortable to carry (even with heavy stuff)
* Fits a laptop + notebooks

1kfmrsg,handbags,Financing Bags & Not Freaking Out Over Wear and Tear,"Long time listener, first time caller. Mods, if this subject falls outside of the rules, I understand and please feel free to delete, but I’m asking as someone who is genuinely curious!

I really want to invest in some beautiful pieces. My husband is a watch guy (a couple of Rolexes, a couple of JLCs, and some other Swiss timepieces), and has always been pretty supportive of me picking some up. But, I’ve always been super apprehensive about it because I feel like a bag is more likely to get damaged than a watch, so I’ve been scared to take the leap and make the investment.

I have 2 questions.
1. How do you generally finance the purchase? He used inheritance money to buy his first watches, and then sells pieces to buy other pieces. How did you make your first big purchase? (Big for me is anything over USD$2K)
2. Leather so beautiful and delicate, and I’m a bit of a tomboy, so I’ve always worried about spending a few Ks and ruining the bag. How did you overcome this fear? Did you start with second hand first to get used to having it and then build from there? 

Any insights would be most appreciated! 

EDIT: I just wanted to say thank you so much for sharing your experiences and perspectives with me! Your advice has helped shift my thinking around being anxious about damaging the bag, and it’s also helped me land on going with secondhand first. I really appreciate your time and responses ❤️",2025-05-05 20:58:28+00:00,10,76

I am going to Paris in June and I’m in search of a new bag to bring with me (it’s also a belated birthday gift to myself). My current collection is very autumn/winter, or too small, or doesn’t quite meet the needs of what I’m looking for. 

What I’m looking for:
-Size: Small (not mini). Needs to comfortably fit a phone, portable battery pack, card case, sunglasses case, lipstick and a few other small bits. I’m 5’1” so ideally nothing too large/boxy. 

-Style: something that zips or at least clasps shut so I can comfortably use it on the metro and in busy places. I like multifunctional bags that I can throw on my shoulder, crossbody, or carry top handle. Ideally something that could be used day and night (but I’m rarely doing really fancy things at night). 

-My personal style is pretty casual but classic (jeans, tees, button ups, cute dresses). I’d prefer something on the quiet luxury side but I don’t mind an IYKYK kind of logo (like the Celine Triomphe hardware).

I’m looking at the Fendi Selleria Baguette and Loewe Small Puzzle Edge, but I’m open to other ideas too. I’m also open to waiting until I get to Paris for the special bag and bringing something more mid-range with me instead, but I could use some ideas there too!

1kffvbp,handbags,Help my find the bag from my memories?,"Hey good folks, I'm coming to you out of desperation.

About a 6-18 months ago, I saw a bag that I believe I first saw on this subreddit.

It was a crossbody box bag with a lot of structure; made to look reminiscent of a fancy hardcover book (or at least, it reminded me of a hardcover book.) It came in dark blue, black, burgundy, and I believe also a camel-y brown color. It wasn't from a large name brand (so not Kate Spade, Marc Jacobs, high end designer, etc.) and while I don't remember the brand name, it was definitely a smaller brand, possibly... french? And I recall the website having vintage vibes (though the items it sold were not vintage.)

It was made of leather and I think around $300-$450 USD at the time I saw it.

It was not a book bag from Well Read, where the handbags are designed to literally imitate real book covers.

Unfortunately I don't remember much else other than I loved it. It could have been limited edition? I've scoured Google/searched this subreddit's past posts and I can't find it.

I've included a poor sketch of what I remember. Unfortunately i don't remember its clasp (or if it had a clasp at all, to be honest.) The front flap definitely had some embossing that I didn't dare attempt to recreate.

The closest thing, but not the right bag, that I found was this vintage [Paloma Picasso bag](https://arcadeshops.com/collections/bags/products/paloma-picasso-pebbled-leather-book-bag) and even this one is more book-ish than the one I remember.

1kfdxul,handbags,Looking for recommendations re: similar to Madewell Bucket Tote,"Hi all! 

I am currently in the market for a new work bag/tote. I really love the style of the Madewell bucket tote but have heard varying reviews regarding its quality. 

Some things I like about it include its overall style, price point, one strap as opposed to two shoulder straps, adjustable strap, size, genuine leather, and colour options. 

Things I am not too fond of include its soft shape, I'd prefer a bag that at least has a structured bottom, reports that the leather is a bit too soft and easily marked up (I don't mind a worn look but only if it's actually worn and not a day old lol). 

I'm wondering if anyone has suggestions for a bag of similar style but maybe a bit more durable! OR if you have the Madewell bag and it's actually amazing, share that too!!

1kfcftp,handbags,Searching for the perfect 3 in 1 bag,"Hi! 

I’m in search of the perfect 3 in 1 bag, and I can’t find any!! ( I mean except from Songmont Luna) 🤭

Please help me!! I searched high and low but can’t seem to find one. 🥺

These are the non negotiables:
- It can be an elegant handbag (with strap, not as a clutch), a shoulder bag, and a crossbody bag. 
- It’s small but it can fit my phone, keys, ID-s, lipstick and some small things.
- The hardware is in gold. 
- It’s leather. 
- It can be bought in brown/beige. 
- budget: maximum 500€
- I have the Songmont Luna so I don’t want another bag in this shape. 

It’s a plus if it can be ordered from the EU, because of tax and stuff. 

I have found one bag that meets all the above: the Verafied NY Mini Gold Chocolate Hobo Bag, but I really don’t like the hanging strap. I wish there was a pocket for it at the bottom (like with the Songmont Reset bag), or that it could be adjusted on both sides so the hanging part is smaller. 

Let me know if you have any suggestions!! 🥰🥰

1kfbz3a,handbags,How are your experiences with Goyard mini bags?,"Heading to Paris soon and considering finally getting the [Goyard Sairgon Structure mini](https://www.goyard.com/eu_en/saigon-structure-mini-2.html#SAIGR2MINTY12CL12P) after eyeing it for years.

I've never purchased a Goyard bag before and have seen mixed reviews for the tote, so I wanted to hear about others' experiences with the brand and this bag (or other mini bags from Goyard) specifically to decide if it's a good buy for me.

1kfb1sy,handbags,Weekly Questions Thread,"Hey folks! Welcome to the weekly question thread. Going forward for a short  while, we will be having a weekly question thread that will be pinned.  You can ask questions about specific bags that don’t require an entire  review to see if anyone has the answer!

We are doing this so that we can start building up an FAQ so that your  questions can be more easily answered. Questions are NOT restricted to  this post, especially if those questions involve discussions! If you have posted in a previous Weekly Question Thread but your question was not answered, feel free to repost it again. 

Here are some example questions:

1. Can an iPhone 13 Pro fit in the Loewe Mini Puzzle?
2. What bag can I use in the rain under $X?
3. Does this bag match this outfit? (Can be asked in this thread or as a discussion post).
4. Has anyone had any experience shopping at <boutique> in <city>?

Examples of what NOT to post:

1. What bag are you wearing today? (This would be better as a discussion post).
2. Where was your best boutique experience? (This would be better as a discussion post).
3. Review  request for Mlouye! (There’s a chance someone who’s purchased won’t see  it as a comment and may be better off as a post for now).

This thread will be reposted every Monday.

The 4-0 is hitting at the end of the year. I rarely splurge on myself unless it's a necessity. I also work from home and don't go out much. But, I think I'm feeling like gifting myself a nice bag this year. I received a Guess handag from rellies for my 30th (I was so overwhelmed with joy that I cried), I still have it but would like another nice functional option for the rare occasion I do leave the house.

Planning on buying here in Australia or in the Philippines at the end of the year, happy to spend up to AUD$500 for something medium/tote size. I know that probably rules out a lot of options, but I would love to hear any thoughts, opinions and suggestions you might have for my practical ass.

I finally decided to take a splurge on the Adax Salerno Mindy bag. However, I’m very split on which color to get.

The dark red is what caused my obsession with this bag. I think it’s absolutely beautiful, has character and it’s the color I was set on getting for days ahead.

The other one is charcoal - a subtly “off-black” color that will go with anything and is as classic as it gets. I’m only now starting to think about it in terms of flexibility.

Now, even though I was dreaming only about the dark red (Barolo) color, I’m worried that it will not go with every color top I have (e.g lavender, fuscia).
The charcoal, however, is a safe bet but with it I’m worried I might regret sticking with the safe bet, as the burgundy has me by a chokehold. 

My style is casual and I wear mostly blues, whites, greens, blacks, pinks.

This will be my main bag.

1kf2y65,handbags,"I want something new, but I'm struggling to pick between these three purses.","I currently own 2 handbags, and I'm looking to treat myself and add another one to my modest collection. The two I own are fairly basic, as one is a simple, black Kate Spade crossbody bag, and the other is a dark brown, soft leather Coach crossbody bag.

Options:

1. Dooney & Bourke shoulder bag in yellow.
-It makes me feel nostalgic for a similar purse I had as a child, and yellow is one of my favorite colors.

2. Fossil satchel in red.
-The style immediately caught my eye, and I have been pleased with the quality of this brand in the past.

3. Kate Spade shoulder bag in off-white.
-It feels simple and classic, and it would pair well with anything I wear.

I tend to throw on jeans or leggings and an old t-shirt on my days off, so I am concerned the colored bags may not look the best with my outfits, but I am also naturally drawn to warm colors, so I don't think it's fair to myself to write them off either.

I realized my “order summary” email confirmation showed the image of what I expected I was getting, but then later emails about shipping status showed images of it with the basic strap, which I think already alerted me I wouldn’t get what I thought. I legitimately thought the purchase would include both but maybe it’s my fault if I didn’t read the description closely enough. Still, the main photos did show the turquoise strap. I can’t even check back now because it’s sold out. ",2025-05-04 22:23:30+00:00,4,11

I shouldn't care, but the reaction (or lack thereof) takes away from some of the excitement a little bit. I recently had a birthday, my husband got me a purse that I really wanted, and nobody said anything. It hurt my feelings a little, because why can't they just be excited that I'm excited?

Called coach, waited for 40 mins on the line, finally CS (real person) got on the line. Upon triple checking, logging back into my account on coach, I realized that I put in the correct address initially. So, not my fault, but somehow upon shipping my address was put in wrong.

I also don’t like a huge tote with no dividers/organizers, because everything just falls and moves around. Does anyone have brand recommendations or bag-specific recommendations that may fit into the type of things I’m describing? To reiterate: fun low-mid tier spacious medium-sized bag. I would prefer for it to not have gold hardware and be leather since I want durability, though I understand it’s difficult to find those in fun colors. :) Thanks!",2025-05-04 07:28:43+00:00,2,3

At the time, I was torn between the mini and the regular size, and in the end I decided to get the mini. I regret it now - I love the bag, but its peculiar shape means that it's not as spacious as I expected, and I end up not using it as often as I cannot carry as much as I would like.

I'm now thinking about selling the mini and buying the regular size. However, I read about Polène's decrease in quality. Is there anyone who recently purchased from them who would like to share their experience? Has the quality gotten down so badly that it would be smarter to look for the bag on the reseller market, instead of purchasing new?",2025-05-04 06:37:23+00:00,0,10

What’s messing me up is the buttons on the dress are gold - I feel like they should be silver but I don’t have enough time to have them changed at a tailor I trust. 

• So my first problem is what do I choose: silver vs gold hardware on a bag.

• Second problem: what style bag should I do? 

I like the pyramid bag because it’s unconventional as hell but it might be hard to get done in a week. I attached another few options that I could do but I’m unsure what to do. If there’s another style that you guys think would be pretty, please attach a picture or describe it!!

1ke45oq,handbags,PSA: Do not buy bags from The Row,"Major quality control issue incoming. I live in a car-necessary city, so I’ve never had this issue occur in the year and a half. I’ve had the bag, but while walking around New York for work this week, my Margaux bag rubbed a TON of brown paint staining into my white (The Row) t-shirt and vintage Levi’s. AND one of the gold feet had popped off.

I was shocked. Luckily, I was near their store on the upper east side, so I walked in and showed them the issue (photos attached).The store manager said their bags absolutely should not be doing that, but she couldn’t be of much help without proof of purchase (didn’t have the email anymore but had a printed receipt in its dust bag at home.) She suggested I take it to my store in LA, and said there was nothing she could do for the shirt. An $800 shirt from their company, I might add…

Anyway, fast-forward to today. I brought my bag to the LA store, and the store manager kept trying to insinuate that the bag had been repainted, which it absolutely had not been.  It was a perfectly sunny day, walking around New York, and then this happened. While the New York manager had said, the bag might be defective, the LA one tried to insist it was something I had done to the bag. While it’s well loved, it’s not been touched up. I only got it last year.

She took photos, and said she’d send it to their production facility, and that it would take about a week to get a response if they could do anything. And again, they would not do anything about the T-shirt. I’m gonna try to take it to the dry cleaners, but at least other designer houses would have offered to pay for the dry cleaning!!  Furthermore, she tried to make it seem like the damage was my fault based on usage. I love this bag, I wanna keep using it, but I did not choose to have it ruin almost $7000 worth of my stuff intentionally.

TLDR, don’t buy from the Row if you want good customer service and a brand that stands by its products’ quality. Surprised, disappointed, and won’t ever be recommending them. Will keep y’all posted if they end up repairing the bag, but even then the lady said cost might be involved. 😡

Expected more from a luxury house. Sigh. *end rant*

1kdymdx,handbags,Proenza Ruched Tote arrived,"The bag arrived today and since a few of you asked for an update, here it goes!

First off: it’s gorgeous. The leather, the construction, the general vibe-so cool and elevated without being flashy. It actually looks even better in person.

Now, onto function:
It’s technically roomy enough for a laptop (mine is 13”) but the base is more like a soft bucket bag, so the corners of the laptop kind of press against the sides/wings. Not ideal for daily laptop schlepping. Totally doable here and there, but I wouldn’t recommend it as your go-to workhorse for that.

Also, while the straps feel sturdy and secure, they’re not the most comfortable if you’re planning to load the bag up with heavy stuff. 

That said, this leather feels tough. It’s got that perfect balance of structure and slouch, and the magnetic closure is so satisfying. Just finds its way shut without fuss. No zipper, which I personally don’t mind (living in a pretty safe place), but worth flagging for those in busier cities. Let’s justnsay it’s quite easy to slide a hand in this bag. 

 I  eeally like how you can play with the ruching. You can leave it more winged-out like a Polène Cyme or cinch it in and go almost bucket style. It holds its shape but still feels flexible. Hard to explain but it works really well.

Verdict: it’s a keeper. I’ll use Acne Musubi as my main laptop/work bag, but this Proenza is just too cool to return. Definitely has a place in the rotation.",2025-05-03 17:42:56+00:00,19,4

1kdye3y,handbags,first designer bag‼️,"Hi everyone!

I’m visiting Europe soon and I’m beyond excited — I’ll be shopping for my very first luxury handbag! After doing some research, I’ve narrowed it down to two contenders:

1.	Loewe Mini Puzzle Edge Bag in Classic Calfskin
2.	Balenciaga Rodeo Mini Leather Tote

A few things about me to help with context: I’m in my early 20s, so I’m looking for a bag that doesn’t feel too structured or formal — something age-appropriate that I can wear day-to-day but still feels elevated and sophisticated.

I originally loved the Gucci Jackie, but I’d prefer something that fully closes (the buckle-only closure didn’t work for me). I’m 5’3”, so oversized bags can look a bit awkward on my frame. I also don’t carry much daily, so a large capacity isn’t a priority.

As for the two bags I’m considering: I know there’s been some discourse around the Loewe Puzzle Edge design, so i’m a little fixated on whether I like the older design more.

Also, I’m not a huge designer buyer in general, so I’m doing as much research as I can to make an informed choice. Maybe there are other great options I’m missing? If anyone has suggestions for a great first luxury bag, I’d love to hear them! I’m looking for something mini or small, preferably with a crossbody strap, and I tend to steer away from anything too logo-heavy.

Thanks in advance! 💕",2025-05-03 17:32:53+00:00,14,12

About two months ago I was debating whether I should get her because it's not the most practical bag for me right now but it was too good of a bargain to pass up and I was kind of obsessed!

It's in super condition and the previous owner got the interior repaired at Gucci which was a bonus selling point as most of the bags on the market that I saw are with crumbling leather interiors or the leather's been peeled off and all that's left is a fuzzy lining.

I wasn't sure where/when to wear the bag as it's not super comfortable to carry when using a stroller but I decided to wear her to a wedding and this is what was in my (essentially diaper) bag.

- Big pouch: baby things (diapers, changing matt, wipes, extra clothes)

1kdw02x,handbags,Would you lend your designer bag to a friend?,"I was in a situation where an acquantaince approached me and asked to borrow my Chanel bag as she had to attend an upscale wedding. I turned her down.

Now let me set the context: This girl is not exactly a close friend, but more of an acquantaince whom I met at an event. She is a junior writer who once approached me and interviewed me to be featured in a bag collection article. I said yes and the article turned out great.

A few months later, this girl texted me saying that she had a wedding to attend and she did not have any nice bag to carry. She said that she felt pressured because all the other girls there would be dressed to the nines. She asked if I knew of any bag rental company that she could go to as she could not afford to buy a designer bag. I happily suggested a few I knew but she casually 'steered' the conversation to something like ""hey you have many Chanel bags! It would be veryyy helpful if you could lend me yadda yadda..""

I turned her down and said I was uncomfortable with lending ANYONE my hard-earned expensive pieces and I would not bear to see any stain or scratch on my bags. I firmly told her to stick to her original plan of going to a bag rental company OR she could just go to the wedding as she was and be confident with or without a designer bag. She sullenly agreed and did not continue the conversation.

My own best friend said that I was a bit harsh in this situation and that I could at least offer my cheapest bag on loan as she had done be a favour and featured me in an article. 

What would you have done if you were in my situation?

1kdt3wi,handbags,Eek is there any way to salvage the strap on this Balenciaga Work Bag?,"Hi guys! I asked my friend to snatch up this vintage Balenciaga Work Bag at a consignment store overseas for around 500NZD (300USD), thinking all it needed was some TLC but now that I have it in my hands, I realise that the leather handles are completely worn out to the point where the inside material is exposed 💀

There are not many specialised designer bag restoration places where I live and I doubt leather repair shops would have Balenciaga bag handle replacements on hand, is there anything I could do to repair it myself?

Probably a long shot but I’m really sad because the overall quality of the bag is in really good condition!

Any help would be appreciated and please let me know if there is a more appropriate subreddit this post belongs to, thank you!",2025-05-03 13:34:33+00:00,3,8

1kdsa6f,handbags,Loewe Mini Hammock Hobo vs Bottega Veneta Wallace?,"These are the two bags I can’t get off my mind at the moment.

The Loewe Mini Hammock Hobo in Tan and the Bottega Veneta Wallace in Fondant.

I’ve seen both bags in person. I’ve tried them on. Multiple times. And some days I prefer the Loewe one, and other times I prefer the BV one. Hahaha

Both bags have gorgeous leather… and I love how lowkey they are (I already have YSL, LV and Celine bags). Right now I’m leaning towards bags eith minimal logos/branding and that’s why these 2 are my top picks.

Furthermore, I’m into shoulder bags at the moment. Both can be worn as shoulder bags.

The cons though — the Loewe’s strap for shoulder bag is quite thin. I’ve tried it on and it’s not too bad… pretty comfy actually coz the bag is really light to begin with. And the SA also assured me that the quality of the leather is superb so it should be alright. But I just can’t help but worry about the leather loops and the thin straps… although, they do have various straps I can purchase which I have also tried, and they look so cute with the bag. 

As for BV, the strap is adjustable… but when I did try it on it keeps slipping. So the best way I can wear it is on the crook of my arm or as a top handle. Also the bag seems bulky as a shoulder bag too, so there’s that. 

I’m also 5’2”, petite, and quite fit.

Which of the two looks more classic? More useful? 

And if you have the Loewe Mini Hammock Hobo bag, how’s the quality of the bag so far (especially the loops and the straps)? As I haven’t seen a lot of reviews for this bag. 

Thanks girlies.

The first was 15 dollars at Walmart the second was free at a charity clothes place. 

My cousin said he would buy me a bag for my birthday if i send him one I want. I don't want to have one to throw it away in a few months. 

I was wondering if there were any websites or brands you know of that make ok bags. 

The price range would be around 30 or 40 dollars. And I like bags with pockets like messenger/weekender types with a good size so I can carry my work stuff. 

I like pink, cats, sparkles, pride flags (trans, lgbt) feminine stuff and nerd stuff. I kind of want it to be fun but I'm wondering if I should sacrifice that for something more functional. 

I am a man but I'm pretty fem and people really get on my case when I do fem stuff but I do it anyways. Sometimes I feel strongly about wanting to do it because I get so mad about not being able to be openly fem without people being weird about it. I just want to be pink and sparkly in peace ;-;. Maybe I'm being too overdramatic but I hate that every aspect of my self expression has to be a fight all the time. I never thought I would be so concerned about a decision for a bag.

- preferably has a zipper closure to minimize risk of thieves sticking their hand inside
- preferably has one handle for comfort 
- must be a classic and timeless color, preferably black
- no logos, no patters, no crazy colors
- price up to 200-300 USD ,I will also look for it on secondhand stores as my budget is small.

The pics I’ve added are of the designs I adore, but always lack in smth - either too small, have no zipper, or too expensive.

1kdleml,handbags,Vintage Coach Beekman 5266 restoration,"I've started a new hobby to help me stay sane in these crazy times: restoring vintage leather bags, particularly Coach bags with glovetanned leather. I prefer finding severely worn pieces that need significant restoration. This is in no way a profitable venture, lol, as I tend to give them away when I’m done with them. Listing them somewhere feels like a hassle.

I recently purchased a 1998 Coach Beekman 5266 from Poshmark for approximately $40. My restoration process included:
- Deep cleaning
- Multiple rounds of conditioning
- Reshaping the bag (still in progress)
- Repainting areas where the leather had shrunk
- Disassembling, repairing, and polishing the hardware

The results are excellent, though I'm still planning to:
- Further refine the shape
- Apply additional conditioning (the leather was extremely dry)
- look for a vintage hangtag from the same era since this one is missing it

I think I might give it to one of my friends' more hipster kids who are graduating soon, as vintage styles (#normcore and #corpcore) are currently trendy.

I find satisfaction in giving quality leather goods a second life and preventing them from ending up in landfills.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ Do any of you have any handbag related hobbies?

1kdgxfc,handbags,Backpack size for daily use?,"I hope this post is okay, and I'm probably overthinking things, but wasn't sure where else to ask.  I'm in my 30s, and have carried around larger, cheap handbags forever, and it's getting pretty inconvenient.  The handles start wearing down from being too heavy, and I realized how much of a hassle they are when I went to an antique store thing in my area with a bar, and trying to carry a drink, shop, and hope my purse doesn't slide off my arm was a little scary.  I've looked at different options, but I'm really liking the idea of a backpack, and a good quality one that I won't have to replace every year.

This is probably where the overthinking comes in, but I've had my eye on some Grafea ones since I love their different designs, but I'm not sure what size would look okay for daily use.  I'm not a student or parent, and I'm wanting something that I can use daily for things like shopping or doctors appointments.  When I look at Grafea's backpacks, they have the Baby line, smaller size, and the Hari line.  I would assume the Baby line would look more ""normal,"" I guess?  But I like to bring a book with me, and I'm not sure how well one would fit.  The Hari line has more design variety, but I'm worried it would look odd for daily use since it's bigger, and I've seen people say they use it for school or travel.

1kdg4uj,handbags,Any help would be greatly appreciated.,"I am looking for a higher end handbag. And keep looking. And looking and going around in circles. 


My criteria:

- must have handles
- must have shoulder or cross body strap 
- ideally leather 
- must zip closed 
- ideally at least one pocket inside 
- large/oversized (larger than 12” wide x 12” tall) 

I love slouchier bags, but this isn’t a must. 

I will be using this mainly as my traveling bag for the plane. So it needs to hold things for myself AND my kid. Think switch, passport holder, snacks, etc. 

Any help would be fantastic. In my search I’ve learned I like Saint Laurent, some LV (the less visually loud the better), Hermes, etc.

1kda274,handbags,Bergdorf NIGHTMARE - do not order from them,"Not sure what to do at this point but want to share my handbag backorder nightmare in case anyone is thinking about ordering from Bergdorf Goodman.

I ordered The Row Marlo bag, in saddle leather (which was not available elsewhere at the time, except waitlist on the Row site) -- in EARLY FEBRUARY. At that time, the backorder estimate was May 22.

In late March, I email BG asking for an update, because The Row Marlo bag has disappeared from the site altogether as a listing. CS responds and says it's still on backorder with a date of mid-late May. They ask if I want to cancel or keep this order, and I say keep if it's in May, since I'm traveling from April 2-28 and out of the country.

April 3, while I'm out of the country, I get charged, but I don't worry too much bc every week or two, I get this charge that then falls off, as BG is continuously trying to make sure my card has the authorization amount for the last 2 months...

April 8, I get the shipment email that it's coming on the way to me (no warning or notice, just a random send after backorder in early February).... since I'm out of the country for another 20 days, I immediately email BG and ask them to hold/delay/cancel this shipment.

BG replies that they cannot cancel this shipment, even though the tracking says Fedex hasn't picked it up just yet. They assure me that Fedex will just send it back if I'm not at home, and signature is required, and then I can place a new order in the future.

April 12, Fedex leaves it with a signature (My first name) in the unattended lobby (no doorman, no mail room). Which I get is Fedex fault, and they probably don't think someone ordered smthg expensive and is not even home for the month, except BG sends things backorder as a surprise timeline with no notice. I'm in a major city with rampant package theft.

I wait until April 28 when I'm home, and it's not there and confirmed that it's not there. Fedex says it's too late for receiver to file a claim now (too much time elapsed -- but I wasn't home before to confirm and also didn't want to raise an alarm for nothing). They say the shipper can file a claim.

I contact BG and they say they file a claim, but then the next day they immediately deny the claim. The reason? ""Fedex says you signed for it"". I call and email and explain that I wasn't even in the country and can offer proof. Fedex also says they cannot take the proof that I wasn't in the country -- but they will take the proof from the shipper as part of their claim. But BG doesn't ask for or want this proof, they just deny the claim on the face of the ""fact"" that Fedex has my ""signature"".

Sooooooo \~$5-6k bag gone and neither BG or Fedex take any responsibility. Fedex might be willing to, but BG doesn't want to go to the trouble of filing a more detailed claim. And I guess they don't have to bc they already have me paying for the bag.

Will of course now file a CC dispute, but not sure what will come of it. I get that it's not totally BG's fault, but given they surprise-sent me a backordered bag from months earlier, and not during the time that they outlined, and they reassured me no recall for the sent package was necessary, they might take a little more responsibility and file a more detailed claim with fedex on my behalf, since I cannot file that claim.",2025-05-02 19:49:35+00:00,111,51

Small / big // brown / white

About me:
- Copper hair, light skin all year
- mostly black clothes, during summer beige, white, baby blue, pink, red
- rather sporty / sporty-chic style, no glam etc
((my proper water bottle can't fit into anything so it doesn't matter when it comes to size))

Struggle:
- small is cute, but maybe I need more space?
- if bigger - do I need that much space for everyday non-school??
- white - I don't have any white accessories and idk how I feel about it but it would fit most summer colors
- brown - I don't really wear brown but it's beautiful, it wont fit all my summer colors tho

Bags I already have:
- 32cm (mid sized) casual crossbody bag in black leather
- sporty but nice, big black fabric fanny pack (my go-to for every day, I wear it crossbody)
- mini black bag, mini red bag, mini cream bag in fake leather (all of them 15-20cm, stiff, rather date-style)
- nice black backpack for laptop
- some random black tote ~30x35cm but I don't use it, and a mid-sized black tote 30x20 that I hate

The reason I didn't gravitate to it at first was that the style is a bit minimalist for my taste, but that turned out to be easily solved with a bag charm (this is a Chala charm I already had).

The last bag I purchased was the Kelly 28 in craie, which I bought from a reputable reseller. I wanted something very specific and didn’t want to jump through the Hermes hoops (though I do love the brand, and my non-quota bags were purchased directly through them). I’ve noticed that, since then, I haven’t had the urge to add more bags to my collection, and when I see a beautiful bag posted here that I love, I just think, “Oh, that’s really beautiful,” and then scroll on by, rather than feeling like I want it for myself and need to add it to my collection. 


Is this what purse peace feels like? No longer feeling like you’re on the hunt for your next bag, or feeling tempted by every bag that you like? Like I said, I do still hope to add a Birkin to my collection someday, but the urgency around the desire for it has hugely subsided. What a foreign feeling 😂

current bags in my rotation are a Coach Swing Zip in light green, [vintage D&B in rainbow plaid](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/fSEAAOSwqC5mtB8Q/s-l1200.jpg), and a [vintage red mongram gucci handbag ](https://www.labellov.com/media/catalog/product/cache/0e2abc934cfdd4ea2c7369b2177f3605/g/u/gucci-red-monogram-bag-front.jpg)(in a different shape than the photo, but exact material). I have a few LVs in Mini Lin and classic monogram prints as well, and use my Ferragamos when I'm feeling particularly ladylike :p

Here are some of my preferences:

\- silver hardware or very minimal gold hardware

\- structured, but pliable (aka I can mush it into my chest when the subway is too crowded)

\- shoulder/handbag - i hate crossbodies ;\_\_;

\- monogram isn't a dealbreaker for me as long as it's cute lol (LV classic monogram is my girl)

\- east-west biased but open to anything that can hold a cardholder, phone, airpods, a lipgloss or two, and sometimes a water bottle

\- i despise tote-style bags (i can't imagine needing a neverfull-sized bag and i'm not nearly neat enough to manage that much space LOL)

\- i'm not afraid of color and patterns

\- PLEASE NO EXCLUSIVITY GAMES. I really hate being on a waiting list or needing to make out with an SA just to get a piece of leather and thread

Thank you, everyone!! <3

It’s the best most versatile bag I’ve ever owned) but on events and outings, I’ll wear other bags. 

I’m going on vacation to Hawaii for a week and it’s a work reward trip (like all who hit their high sales goal are rewarded this all-expenses paid trip - food and everything, and they are hosting various events for us, but we can go on the island and explore too) 

My colleagues who make millions of dollars per year will be there as they have earned this reward, and it’s my first year going, so I definitely plan on dressing to impress which means I want to bring multiple bags and shoes! I obviously cannot bring all 20 of my bags, but wanted to crowd source and see what people who use them as fashion accessories first, and function second, do when they travel. How do you decide which to bring? Do you plan specific outfits down to the bag or do you do a “capsule” thing? 

Also, any advice on how to pack them for travel would be great! I also plan on going to the Hermes store in Honolulu while I’m there (we don’t have Hermes in my city, closest is 4 hours away) and fingers crossed on needing room to bring back a Picotin. So people who buy bags when you travel, I’d like to hear from you too. Do you pre-plan room or just hope for the best lol

1kcovjj,handbags,Another ISO work bag post,"I know this post has been made a million of times and trust me, I’ve searched through this sub and still can’t find want I’m looking for. Hoping the handbag fairies can guide me.

I’m looking for a work bag, preferably something that can hold a 15” laptop. It’s not a deal breaker if it can’t, but it must be able to fit a 9x12 folder.

I work from home, but I like to have a cute semi professional bag when meeting clients. Most of my clients are high-net-worth and I meet them at fancy places.

I currently own, a Mulberry Bayswater Tote, that I use as my “work” bag, when I need to carry my laptop. Unfortunately, the bag isn’t ideal when it’s pouring down rain.

I’ve seen myself being attracted to more structured bags like Hermes Kelly, Celine Conti, Delavux Tempete, Ferragmo Iconic Top, Aspinal of London Florence, etc… I just can’t spend $5k on a bag right now.

My budget is less than $3k. The bag doesn’t have to be a designer bag, but I would love a real leather bag.

I’m hoping someone here can see my vision and lead me to the bag of my dreams. TIA!",2025-05-02 01:11:38+00:00,1,4
1kcokkt,handbags,Detailed Review: Hyer Goods Ring Bag,"I’ve been on a journey to find a slouchy leather crossbody that would be a quick sling situation on days that I’m in athleisure (which is all of the time when I’m not at work lol). I wanted something versitile, bonus points if it could sit across my chest fanny pack style and also sit further down at my hip when necessary. I considered The Row’s banana bag but couldn’t get past the 2K price point for a bum bag. Tried on the Lemiare croissant but I’m too short (why isn’t the strap adjustable!) and it hung low on my outer bum rather than up high on my hip like I prefer. 

I almost settled with a new Clare V Grande Fanny… until I found the Hyer Goods ring bag! I loved the idea of a bag that lets you wear it 3 ways with an interchangeable ring system and multiple strap options. I’m always skeptical though; can a bag realllly do all 3 things well or at some point is it trying to be too many things? In the case of this ring bag I think the goal was achieved and it looks good all ways. But read on - you can be the judge :)

Pros: 
- Love the vibe. The ring bag is giving upleveled casual, think a leather version of the uniqulo sling for the modern woman who needs to get shit done and be hands free! With sleek calfskin leather and gold hardware, it looks nice with work clothes or casual. 
- Sorry but can we have a moment for a well made black leather bag with a zipper? With so many bag closure systems these days, hardware woes, and novelty colors… ya girl loves a black crossbody with a zip that just does what it’s supposed to! Which is stop my shit from flying out everywhere when I inevitably fling it across my passenger seat. lol. 
- No logos or unnecessary embellishments 
- Leather seems good quality for a mid tier bag. It’s supple, slouchy, and moulds to the body across the chest. 
- Bag arrived with 2 additional leather strap options: one longer for crossbody that is adjustable depending on where you like your bags to sit, one medium sized for shoulder carry. Straps are sturdy and work as advertised with “O” rings that attach to each end of the bag. The bag looks great both, across the body and on the shoulder, IMO. 
- Not only that but the bag is designed to have all straps removed and it can become a little circle clutch you can wear on your arm. And the way it slouches in that position is also lovely. MAYBE MY FAVORITE WAY TO SEE IT! Even filled with stuff, the shape is pleasing in all formats. (I like the shape and slouch a lot more than the Songmont Luna, which it feels similar to)

Cons:
- The con I have to mention is the hardware. I would totally believe this bag was worth $400 if it wasn’t that the hardware is very light weight and way too bright. Ironically so much of the bag’s function is dependent on the rings for interchanging straps; I worry how long they will hold up and will report back in a few months. Idk WHY they didn’t use something with more heft that could give a higher quality feel to the purse. 
- The leather is on the thinner side. I understand the slouchy shape is mostly possible because the bag is slinky and light… not too concerned about this as it seems hardy.
- Also not a con but finding the right size has been tough. I bought two sizes: regular and small, which they call piccola. I like everything about the regular size. The way the leather moulds to your body definitely hides how big the bag is. I’m usually a mini bag girl but I love how roomy this one is and how it looks on the body. Even as a short gal it’s not too much. When youre wearing it as a circle it is just sooo slouchy and cute! However, when trying it on around the house I couldn’t fill the regular size very much without the weight causing the strap and hardware to dig in. If I was wearing a necklace it rubbed me raw. Why have a bigger bag if you can’t use the space? I think I will end up keeping the piccola because I liked it *almost* as much and it doesn’t have the digging issues. 

But maybe not - if you’ve made it this far, you tell me, which one do I keep!?

To be able to find one with a vertical zipper compartment on the back (as shown in 3rd picture) that could fit my phone would be ideal. I like that it’s hidden.

1kcdlt9,handbags,How do you consider a purchase?,"I just posted this as a comment but actually felt compelled to make an actual post. The Clare V bag porcelain bag strap is very popular and is currently sold out on the website. Target just came out with a knock off.

While the Target strap may be budget friendly, I wouldn’t suggest it to others to buy and I’m not even coming from a “boycott Target” perspective.

The first chain in the picture is Claire V. It’s porcelain and brass hence the price point. The second chain in the picture is Target and it is polyester and acrylic - plastic.

There is a very big difference in craftsmanship with both. Target not only created a knockoff but knocked off Claire V, a woman owned company based in Los Angeles where they still work with family owned companies years after they got started and support charities such as “mothers count” an organization supporting women during childbirth. (I do not work for Claire V or have anything to do with the company)

There have been many discussions in this sub about supporting/not supporting Target but I think the conversation is bigger than Target. Who do we want to support and why? Are we ok with not supporting artists and creators because it can be found cheaper? Does this item go to the landfill once the season is over because it is plastic?

I think at this point and time we should all ask more questions when considering a purchase, especially one that someone, somewhere spent time creating (Claire V) and someone, somewhere spent time producing in what we can assume was not great conditions (Target).",2025-05-01 16:53:18+00:00,193,25
1kcdkxg,handbags,Polene Cyme or Demellier New York (or rebuy Longchamp Le Pliage),"Hello, I know there have been topics on the past of this, but they do not answer my questions completely.

Currently I have the Longchamp Le Pliage which I really like, it is very big and fits everything and it is very lightweight. However I have this bag for less than 1 year and all the edges are open already. I know that Longchamp offers repair so I will definitely do that. But the quality disappoints me, as I never put this bag on the ground, but I do put a lot of stuff in it.

I am eying alternative options such as Polene Cyme (Large) and Demellier New York (Large). I like the shape of the bag and leather is more durable than the nylon bags. But in the past I have had leather bags and they were very heavy and I like bringing these bags for travel so that is a con. I was wondering how heavy Polene and Demellier bags are.

1kcdkq2,handbags,Random question for my handbag aficionados,"For those who enjoy a good cigar bar, what is a good bag type to take in? Going to a birthday night out, and the place we’re going has ok ventilation, but the last time we went, I took a Coach bag, that took serious effort to get the cigar smell out.  

Should I just get a cheap, I’m talking $20 or under bag and call it a day?  If so, can someone recommend styles?

1kcd43k,handbags,Looking for the perfect work bag for the woman with too much stuff,"Hi all, I have been researching work bags for two weeks now and have made zero progress. I am looking for a high-quality bag to be my work tote, and I schlep a lot of stuff too and from the office. There are a few evergreen bags I see recommended (the Kaai Pyramid, the Cuyana tote) but most of them don't work for me for one reason other another (outlined below). If y'all have any suggestions, I would be SO grateful!

Budget: under $1000 (including if I can get it on resale) 

Material: black leather with gold hardware

Shape: I'm open to a shoulder-bearing tote as long as the weight is well-distributed, I'm also interested in a fancy convertible backpack. However, I tried the Senreve Maestra and hated how the weight was distributed. 

Requirements: Needs to at least fit a 15"" laptop, a clutch wallet, a small bag with medication, and random other small objects I use throughout my day. I'm looking for a structured bag that stands on its own and has ""feet"" to keep from getting dirty. I'm looking for something sharp, professional, and stylish, but also practical for my needs. 

Thank y'all!

The big question is which one do I choose between the small double and the shoulder style? Especially to those who have both, which one do you enjoy using more?

I’m normally a smaller bag kind of girl so the small double isn’t something that I would usually consider, but that design is so interesting. And I thought that it would certainly be unique in my collection. But the shoulder style is something that I can see myself using a lot too, with the size probably fitting my body frame better.

For reference, I’m quite short (around 4’11”) and usually wear my bags as a crossbody. Other bags I’ve enjoyed wearing are the Celine Nano Belt Bag, Polene Numero Un Nano, Kate Spade Margaux Medium Satchel, and Kate Spade Knott Flap Crossbody.",2025-05-01 15:06:46+00:00,105,45

What I actually need is a good everyday bag that is light, pretty small, and crossbody.

- They also had marmont camera bags for $1200 I think?

That said, there was one occasion with my most recent ex that sticks out. We got quite a bit of money to do some Christmas shopping from my auntie and uncle, and he ended up getting himself a Rolex and a new expensive computer. We then walked past a Guess outlet and he told me that since he got himself something nice, I should treat myself to a guess bag. No shade if you like them, but thinking that Guess bags are on par with buying a Rolex and an expensive computer is just wild.

Didn’t get the Guess bag for myself but guess (pun intended) what i ended up unwrapping on Christmas Eve. A Guess bag, and probably the most affordable one you can get.

I countered with what I felt was far more reasonable. 

No repair kit (since I’ll be taking it to an artisan) and the glasses case, makeup case and passport holder & was told I could purchase those, separately & they would still only offer 

either the coin purse, or card holder and repair kit if I wanted…

I likely will never purchase from them again. And that makes me really sad. I am very vocal about brands I love & have been telling friends and strangers all about my love of my new bags - complimenting them whenever asked about them. Now I will let anyone know… it’s up to you but their customer service is not ideal and the bags fall apart within a month. 

I care very much about my bags and bag care. They are kept in dust bags/boxes when not in use, and I condition and treat them as my kiddos cuz I love handbags.

A real shame for a brand that I planned to tout on my podcast.

1kbkuic,handbags,Songmont Large Yore Hobo or Coach Brooklyn 39?,"I want a large, brown, casual, and slouchy bag to add to my collection! I’ve narrowed my search down to the Songmont Large Yore Hobo bag or the Coach Brooklyn 39. I’d be happy with either one, but not sure which one to go for.

Songmont: love the pockets, especially in front of the bag for dropping my phone in easily. I’ve read other reviews for the smaller sizes of this bag and it seems light itself. My concern is straps - not sure how they’d hold up with a medium or heavy load. Though, I love the option to carry as a crossbody if needed.

Coach: love the overall look. Really, my only concern is wear and tear on the corners and no external pockets.

If you have any experience with either bag (especially with wear and tear) I’d love to hear it!

I want to buy my GF a bag that she can use as a daily. I have bought several, but those are too big to be used as a daily. She currently uses a guess fedana bag, but it’s proven to be too small. A tad bigger would be perfect! I have a budget up to 500 euros! (can stretch if needed)

Height:** 14 cm  
- **Length:** 26 cm  
- **Width:** 11 cm  are the dimensions of the current bag

This is my first time asking a question like this, so if I need to provide more info lemme know!

1kbjg3w,handbags,Searching for everyday black bag,"Hi all! Longtime lurker looking for advice. I want to get a black every day bag - I don’t carry a lot with me and I have a petite frame so a smaller shoulder bag (bonus if it can be converted to crossbody). I usually just carry keys, phone, card holder, chapstick and sunglasses. 

My current collection - 
Celine multipochette in black shiny calfskin for special events 
LV neonoe MM (bought years ago as my first luxury bag and I rarely use it as I find it bulky for a shoulder bag) 
Strathberry East/West mini in bottle green - also for more special occasions as I found it’s easily banged up, plus it’s pretty small for every day 
Polene numero dix textured taupe - by far my most used luxury bag, love it for everyday 
Frank Clegg Mini Bucket Bag in black - another one of my most used but can’t be worn as a shorter shoulder bag 

Wish list: Gucci Jackie in the burgundy/rosso ancora leather, I had also been considering this in black but feel like the burgundy is more special 
Celine small Camille 16 in tan (was also considering black but fell in love with tan in the store) 

Bags I’ve been considering: my two wishlist items but in black, one of the Prada shoulder bags (thinking they may be more durable for everyday use? I considered nylon but the price feels so high for the material), and the Demellier Tokyo bag. 

I’m open to all brands and price points, I’m just looking for something that is durable, on the smaller side, can be worn as a shoulder bag, and a basic but cute black bag!

1kbegaf,handbags,Loewe Flamenco: A review from someone who didn’t fall in love,"So, this is basically an update to my post from about 200 days ago titled “Help me choose a gift for myself”. After a long time of contemplating and also buying other stuff first (looking at you, Wishbone Chair), I finally got my “gift” and pulled the trigger on the Flamenco in chocolate. Customer service and shipping were excellent and the bag arrived in a deliciously red  box with tomatoes printed on it (Paula’s Ibiza I presume). Upon opening, I immediately noticed the smell of the leather. My partner and I would say that the bag smells like new leather shoes maybe, that’s what it reminded me of anyways. The color and feel of the bag really was divine and my partner immediately said: “yeah that’s the one, that’s the most beautiful bag I’ve seen on you”. I, on the other hand, was disappointed since 1. The bag was smaller than I expected it to be and 2. The strap really cut into my shoulder once I tried putting a book into the bag. Don’t get me wrong, it really fits a lot (even a Nalgene!) but the strap of my Celine for example is way more comfortable. 
Since I didn’t love it enough I ultimately returned it and I’m now thinking of getting the Puzzle Fold Tote since it seems like an easy grab and go kind of bag. 
So, my conclusion: if you love the bag definitely go for it. The leather is so so nice and beautiful.  It just wasn’t for me, the strap became the biggest turn off in the end. For 2.2k€, I need to be fully convinced!

1kbd3x2,handbags,My new mens Fendi,"So i bought this Mens Fendi peekaboo medium at the Honolulu store. (MINUS the french fry charm.. Fendi has dozens of charms to embellish bags)).Not sure why it's not called large.  I initially went in wanting the new yellow small bag with the 100th Anniversary Fendi crest embossed, but saw this beauty and had to choose this one. It is stunning in person and a large size. Yes it's expensive but all the designer boutiques in Hawaii give a special 10% off Hawaii rate from the website price plus the sales tax is approx %4.5 ish.

Anyway, I have yearned for quite awhile for the large mens Saint Laurent croc embossed sac de jour and an toying with purchasing that before it becomes harder to find. It is no longer on the SLP 
website but the boutique can request it from a non US store and offer that 10% Hawaii rate.  Or it's on a variety of pre loved sites..  I'm not at all wealthy, but came into a little money due to my fathers passing a year ago. Hence wanting pieces that  stand the test of time. 

Question. Do you think they are too similar to 
Have both? The Fendi is not a tote but a structured bag with secure  pockets on both sides,  and easily holds my 14"" Mac. Heck, I can put two laptops in it.  The Saint Laurent is more of a big tote, but this is i can see putting a sweater in it PLUS the laptop etc. Or change of clothes. But it is not secure and has an open top.. not at all a deciding factor. Still it is beautiful and disappearing from availability. I've looked at the Balenciaga City but I like a more structured bag and bit slouchy.

1kbcsgy,handbags,Help me pick a bag!,"Hi, all. I’m in Madrid for Holiday and have been going back and forth to the Fendi store 4 times because I can’t make up my mind. I’m looking for a black bag that can be both casual date night or for a special occasion. 

Slide 1, Fendi First: this is only on here because it’s discontinued so it would likely be my only chance getting it outside of the preloved market. Design 10/10. Rich, soft lambskin leather. Can be clutch or shoulder, strap isn’t long enough for crossbody.  Cons are it’s more for fancier occasions, I’ve heard lambskin is terribly prone to wear and tear and is high maintenance. 

Slide 2, I See You cross: classic Fendi silhouette. I love the bag but I feel it’s more business, formal. Maybe I just need to know how to style myself better?

Slide 3, Soft Trunk Baguette: men’s baguette style. Kind of the top contender and also the cheapest on the list. It has card slots so I wouldn’t need to bring a wallet and can fit all date night essentials. Can also be crossbody, shoulder, and a clutch. I love that the Fendi Logo is embossed in the leather and not as obvious as their monogrammed canvas ones. Con, it’s a fabric strap and there’s no leather strap. 

Slide 4, Another soft trunk baguette: this one doesn’t have the embossed logo and is more low key. For me, the large stitching really bothers me and makes it look more amateur. The CA was telling me that that’s Fendi’s signature hand stitching but it looks a little sloppy. Idk if that’s making any sense. 

1 and 3 are my top contenders. My partner likes the I see you. I wanted to know your thoughts as well. Thanks in advance and have a great day!",2025-04-30 10:05:42+00:00,1,10

1kau8ig,handbags,"For those that change bags often, how do you organize your stuff?","Basically the title - for those of you that switch bags often, how do you organize your stuff? Do you have inserts or pouches inside that you can easily move from one to the other? Do you have one “main” bag and then add on a tote or another bag as needed? 
Perhaps I’m over thinking this but currently finding it hard to switch bags often due to the amount of item transfer, or I end up forgetting my wallet in a previous bag, etc…

I’ll also say I’m a total newbie and just starting to get into bags (I was working on my wardrobe and shoes prior, finally satisfied with those)! 

I’ll outline my daily scenario and perhaps that will clarify my struggle. 
For work:
 1. I have a huge heavy laptop (13.5” by 10”) this monstrosity is provided by work and not my choice. I currently have one tall leather tote that fits it (BR slouchy vida bag). I’m always on the hunt for other bags that fit it and currently waiting on a longchamp honore 404 to see if it’ll fit. Mouse, and sometimes charger. 
2. My A5 plotter notebook, small pencil case
3. Personal items - chapstick, lip glass, comb, hand sanitizer, etc 
4. Essentials- phone, keys, wallet

Other- depending on the day, small lunch box, umbrella, etc…


Recently I got the Coach Turnlock Edie, so I’ve put all my personal items into that, and am trying to keep all work stuff in the Vida tote. However now I need a third bag if I bring my lunch for the day. Previously I just had a canvas organizer inside the Vida tote and combined my work and personal stuff. However, after work I shlep kids around to their activities and run errands. I don’t want to have the huge Vida tote for this (even without the laptop) so I’ve been using the Edie (which works great) except it’s a bit too large and heavy for quick errands or kids sports where I end up walking a ton and I don’t need to have as much stuff with me. 

I also recently got the Mansur Gavriel Lilium bag in pink (which reminds me of a tulip and I think is perfect for spring)! So do I just dump all my stuff from the Edie into it when I want to switch? Seems odd having everything loose in there because it doesn’t really close all the way? Am I just being dumb? 

I also sometimes manage to go on walks during my workday, and most of my outfits don’t have pockets, so ideally I need a small bag just for my phone and wallet perhaps? Maybe something thin that can fit into my work tote but can be taken out as needed? Then keep the Edie for weekends?

The Strathberry is slightly wider so it fits the cards more comfortably. But the D&G is such a cute pop of color 🩷 although it can only fit 3 cards comfortably, a fourth one would be too snug. However, I usually carry only 2-3 cards when I wear my tiny bags.

PS: I currently use the YSL zip card case as my main wallet, which is slightly longer and thicker due to the zipper. I also have a Gucci Card Case with the flap and coin purse, which I use for bigger bags. Aside from these, I just have 2 LV key cles which I use as a mini catch all instead of a wallet.

1kas92o,handbags,Battle of the off-white bags: Coach vs Strathberry,"I'm looking to add a just barely off-white bag to my collection and I'm torn between the Coach Chain Tabby 30 in Chalk ($595) and the Strathberry Mosaic in Vanilla ($605). I'm planning to wear it as my main bag this spring/summer, and my typical clothes range from shorts and tees to sundresses.

Coach pros:
- Back pocket that fits my phone
- Multiple carry options: chain, short shoulder strap, long adjustable strap
- I got to try it in person, so I know it fits what I want to carry
- The leather is soooo soft and smooshy. Very good quality (fine grain goat leather)
- Nice mix of structured and slouchy

Coach cons:
- I don't usually like dividers in bags (the compartments are big, though)
- Looks kind of large (messenger bag-like) when worn crossbody

Strathberry pros:
- Strathberry seems like a more exciting brand to me
- Pebbled leather is probably hardier
- One big main compartment
- Magnetic closure for ease of getting in/out of bag (easier than a magnetic button)

Strathberry cons:
- I can't see it in person before purchasing, so I can't get a feel for the size or quality
- The large depth makes it look a little bulky crossbody in photos
- Only carry options are hand carry and long shoulder/crossbody; I prefer a short shoulder strap to a handle

What would you choose if you were me? I'm also open to other suggestions. I'm normally a luxury bag shopper, but I can't stomach luxury prices for a white bag (more prone to wear/damage) that I'll only wear a few months out of the year.

Other contenders I ruled out:
- Strathberry Multrees hobo: not big enough
- Coach Soft Tabby: not big enough, boring looking, lacking the spectacular leather of the Chain Tabby
- Coach Chain Tabby 26: only barely fits my stuff, phone doesn't fit in the back pocket
- Clare V Moyen Messenger: I was so close to buying this, but the color (Cream) is darker than what I'm looking for. The Clare V website makes it look lighter, but other photos online look more light beige than off white. It's probably also too unstructured for my preferences.

1kaoarg,handbags,Shanghai handbag gem,"Hey everyone, long time lurker, but first time poster. 

I’m currently in Shanghai and visited the ZZER consignment warehouse. For those not in the know, they sell second hand bags. Auth is done by the team there, basically a real life TRR. Anyway, for those interested in bags, I’d definitely recommend visiting, there are so many models to try on (you are given gloves to ensure you don’t dirty/damage the bags), and you’re left alone to browse as you wish, so there is no pressure and no time limit. It’s a great way to try on styles that you may be unsure about or even find hidden gems. 

I decided to go for a Celine Classic Box bag in small. It’s in great condition with only a few marks (inevitable with a calfskin bag) and bought it for approx £550 ($770 ish). It doesn’t come with its own dust bag (though the store gave me one of theirs so it doesn’t get damaged in transit) or auth card but I’m not fussed, it’s a bag I’ve wanted for years but never prioritised over other bags, the leather and colour feel and look great, and I have zero plans to sell it. Even if that were to change, I don’t see bags as an investment so wouldn’t expect or want much for it. 

So to anyone visiting Shanghai, I highly recommend a trip there. They literally have all the brands, from Coach and Longchamp to vintage Chanel and Hermes (Kellys and Birkins are protected behind glass or in plastic cases, and can only be viewed with staff’s assistance). I’m saving the vintage Chanel for my Japan trip in a few weeks but still great to walk around and see so many beauties. This is also my first second hand bag, something I probably would have never considered years ago but have definitely had my eyes opened by this sub and the amazing finds, so thanks everyone!

1kad0b8,handbags,Would you return this? Status Anxiety bag arrived creased because of inadequate packaging,"I recently ordered 2 bags from Status Anxiety with a first-timer 15% off discount. They threw both bags in a giant Tyvek bag with no protection. One bag arrived fine, but the one pictured has a noticeable crease running along the bottom frame. You can see in the second pic that even the dust bag it came in (on the right) has the same crease, so the damage probably happened in transit.

Customer service offered an additional 15% off as compensation. But with Status Anxiety's current 20% off sale, that doesn't feel like much more savings to keep a bag that's creased near a structural part. While in transit, my package was stuck in the Jersey City USPS distribution center for 12 days without movement—likely sitting crushed underneath other packages the whole time.

Would you return it and take your chances buying a new one at the 20% sale? Or keep it with the small extra discount?

**Related PSA to US Folks:** Status Anxiety is shipping from NY to avoid tariffs, but their courier doesn't have boxes available. If you're shopping their sale, consider styles that can better withstand shipment in just a Tyvek mailer. Especially since all the USPS distribution centers in NY are severely backlogged. My Mini Mountains bag arrived just fine, probably because it's a squishier bag that doesn't have a rigid frame.",2025-04-29 02:09:47+00:00,3,5

For reference, I really like the look of the Coach Empire 40/48 and the Smaak Amsterdam Barbra XL, but before I go with either of those I wanted to see if this sub had any other suggestions.

She didn’t disclose anything specific, just said the bag was “barely worn/excellent condition”. This is obviously a preloved bag, so maybe my expectations are off. Overall, I really, really like it.

1ka66rz,handbags,Help me pick one! (Sand suede vs Chocolate suede),"Hello everyone,
I’m a 28 year old female, and I already own this bag in black leather(last picture). I love it so much that I’m thinking about ordering another one!
I currently have four bags in total (three black leather, one ivory leather), and this is by far my favorite.

I usually dress very casually (leggings and hoodies most of the time), and even in formal or work settings, I could only go business casual.
I’m looking for a timeless piece(something that will still feel stylish 10 or 20 years from now) because I rarely buy bags (maybe once every two years or even less).

I’m torn between getting the same bag in suede sand or suede chocolate.
Is there anyone from the fashion industry (or anyone with a good eye for timeless style) who could help me?
Also, am I just being dramatic? Is suede a bad idea if I want something that will really last? Will suede bags go out of style soon?

Would love your thoughts! Thank you so much!",2025-04-28 20:48:42+00:00,6,5

Also, the bowling bags that are popular are very colorful, it's part of the reason I love them. I don't know if this bag is real or faux leather, but maybe I can dye it.

1ka2llg,handbags,Help me find my man purse holy grail,"Hey everyone,
I’ve been searching for what feels like forever and could really use some advice on a forever man’s purse / work bag. 

Here’s an idea of what I’m looking for:

* Must fit a laptop + over-ear headphones, glasses cases, notebooks, chargers, etc.
* Prefer leather — something durable and nice-looking
* Not crazy wide — would love to keep it under 6 inches deep
* Big open main compartment with a flat bottom (so stuff doesn’t get lost in the black hole)
* Exterior pockets would be amazing. I want to be able to grab my wallet, ID, or headphones easily when I’m standing in line at TSA or at a coffee shop
* Bonus if it has multiple interior pockets and pen holders for staying organized
* Needs to be casual enough for a t-shirt at the airport but still polished enough for work meetings

For inspo, here are a few bags I’ve been eyeing:

Time Resistance Leather Briefcase for Men - Italian Full Grain Leather Laptop Bag - Messenger Bag 
https://a.co/d/evk8F9b

Time Resistance Leather Briefcase - Italian Handmade Laptop Bag - Work Bag for Men and Women - Attache - Computer Bag
https://a.co/d/doEbooh

I’m open to totes, satchels, soft-structured briefcases, just looking for something that actually works for real life and doesn’t feel too stiff or formal.

If you have a bag you love (or have seen one you think would fit), please drop a rec! Would love to finally find the one.

1k9v017,handbags,Weekly Questions Thread,"Hey folks! Welcome to the weekly question thread. Going forward for a short  while, we will be having a weekly question thread that will be pinned.  You can ask questions about specific bags that don’t require an entire  review to see if anyone has the answer!

We are doing this so that we can start building up an FAQ so that your  questions can be more easily answered. Questions are NOT restricted to  this post, especially if those questions involve discussions! If you have posted in a previous Weekly Question Thread but your question was not answered, feel free to repost it again. 

Here are some example questions:

1. Can an iPhone 13 Pro fit in the Loewe Mini Puzzle?
2. What bag can I use in the rain under $X?
3. Does this bag match this outfit? (Can be asked in this thread or as a discussion post).
4. Has anyone had any experience shopping at <boutique> in <city>?

Examples of what NOT to post:

1. What bag are you wearing today? (This would be better as a discussion post).
2. Where was your best boutique experience? (This would be better as a discussion post).
3. Review  request for Mlouye! (There’s a chance someone who’s purchased won’t see  it as a comment and may be better off as a post for now).

This thread will be reposted every Monday.

### Must-Haves

* Budget: Up to 1,500 USD
* Aesthetic: Modern, sporty, minimal. My style is very casual and sporty, usually jeans or jean shorts with sneakers, Birkenstocks, or Blundstone boots. I'm looking for a high quality purse that I don't need to baby, and won't scratch or mark easily. I'm looking for something high quality, functional, and classic, but ideally with a bit of flair / not the very most basic.
* Minimal branding: I'm looking for something not obviously branded. I like Coach but I *don't like* the classic ""C"" buckle or printed fabric.
* Crossbody strap: Not a thin, afterthought type of crossbody strap, a real one that can carry a stuffed purse. 
* Mid-size: Should be roomy enough for sunglasses case, small wallet, phone, keys, headphone case, chapstick, and tissues.
* Opening / access: I don't want an open-top bag like a tote (it needs to be secure on the subway and bus), but I'm looking for something that's not finicky to open and close. I want to be able to access my phone and chapstick easily while walking. I really dislike narrow zipper openings that scratch my hands. I prefer a magnetic flap or a simple closure (like the Coach rogue top handle, which is my dressier bag).


### Nice-to-Haves
* Pockets! Sections! 
* Color: I don't wear any black but I'm open to many other colors...navy, green, brown, taupe...
* I don't like shiny metal or anything bright / flashy. I prefer non-shiny metal or no metal at all. My color season is soft autumn so bright / shiny doesn't suit me.
* I prefer a bag that's nicely lined, not raw leather.
* I prefer structured bags over unstructured. I'm leaning towards something semi-structured.
* I prefer grained over smooth leather. 

Thank you in advance for any ideas or recommendations.

1k9gm0g,handbags,More VAT questions (leaving the EU),"Just read through the thread about VAT refunds and exchange rates. I’m doing a similar trip to Europe. Going from Austria to Slovakia and then flying to the UK. From what I read if I bought my bag in say Vienna, I’m supposed to do the tax refund out of Slovakia as it’s where I’m leaving the EU. But after I go to London, I am going back into the EU to Spain and Belgium. These are all on different flight itineraries/airlines. So at which point do I find the Global Blue office? I’m hoping Bratislava as it’s such a small airport. At the same time on my flight home I have like a 5 hour layover in Amsterdam and read they have high VAT refunds, so was curious anyone’s experience duty free at like YSL or Gucci in AMS airport. I’m worried to wait until my last stop to shop but if it’s less hassle and prices are comparable I might consider (plus I won’t have to carry it around with me).

And to confirm all EU countries you have to do VAT refunds at the airport, correct? Like in Japan you can do it at the store (for now) and get an immediate refund. I thought I read in Hungary or maybe Poland you could do it immediately but now I can’t find where I read that. ",2025-04-27 22:41:05+00:00,2,1

I am full of gratitude today as my younger self wouldn’t have thought I’d come this far. I bought this by spending a portion of my annual bonus 😆

Please wish me good health with the bag! I wish you guys enjoy yours too in peace and in Good health! ",2025-04-27 22:31:23+00:00,259,44

It is unique (to me) because it comes with this think guitar strap along with the normal strap. I believe that it sold in 2022, but I cannot find another Marcie that sells with a thick strap like this so it makes me curious why this one was sold this way? Was it a special edition? Did Chloe just feel like adding a thick strap randomly to one? I have google image searched and not getting really any answers/results. Figured if anyone would know, perhaps someone in this group :) ",2025-04-27 21:43:40+00:00,5,1

HOWEVER I recently got the Samsung Galaxy Flip, which folds into half the size of a regular phone. So now I want to get a cute teeny bag to go with my new phone. Recommend your favourite bags that you've passed on because they didn't fit regular sized phones? Preferably something that's versatile and not too dressy.

1k9e8wf,handbags,a cuff purse? a bangle bag?,"I got a bag like [this](https://www.riverisland.com/p/burgundy-metal-grab-bag-922634) on a whim at a secondhand shop, and fell in love with it after running errands with it over the weekend. It's fitted at the wrist, sort of like a wristlet, but because of the thick strap and shape, it stays on effortlessly. As if one is wearing a chunky cuff, with a reticule sprouting out of it

Friend wanted one for herself but found out that it's likely originally from a site with awful labor practices (could also be from River Island, but there is no label on the inside). Would you know of other bags like these, or a name I can search them under? Wristlet was the only term I could think of, but still very different from what I'm looking for. Not attached to any particular material, just the shape and ease of use.

I know Goyard isn’t everyone’s favorite here (and honestly, I get why — I thought about it a lot before buying).
But I really needed something low-key, lightweight, and easy to travel with — and the Artois just made sense.

It’s structured enough to stand up on its own, has a zipper (!!!), and the longer straps are super comfy.
Not gonna lie, I also love that it feels a little more iykyk (where I live). 

I’m planning to put it through real life — work, errands, travel — so we’ll see how it holds up.

1k99381,handbags,"Coach at Cat Street, Tokyo — super cool boutique","I set my sights on a Coach Tabby 26 as my bag purchase for this year, so I added a visit to a boutique in Tokyo to my itinerary. Found out they had this new branch in Harajuku. As soon as I saw the photos, I knew I had to visit!

The building stood out from most of the other boutiques along Cat Street because of the architecture, and I loved the giant Tabby at the entrance lol. It was so much more youthful-feeling than their other stores, with neon lights, cartoons and a whimsical layout. I think it had four floors. The top floor was a cafe! Sadly we didn’t get to try it. They also had some exclusive merch, like mugs, canvas totes and bag accessories.

In the end, I got myself a Coach Chain Tabby 26 in black. At first I wasn’t sure of the size because I’m a small bag girl and I was concerned that it would look too big on me. I was choosing between that and the original Tabby that’s more structured, but I fell in love with how the Chain Tabby looked crossbody. It was very light and not bulky at all, and the crossbody strap was nice and thick. You can also wear it as a shoulder bag, using either the chain or the shorter leather strap. I’m a sucker for bags that can be worn multiple ways.

I got to try the Brooklyn 28, which was super nice too but I only had the budget for one bag, and it’s overpriced in Japan for some reason.

I was immediately approached by an SA, who was super friendly and helpful. I did want to have some more time looking around the shop at a more relaxed pace, but she never left my side lol. Still, loved the level of service! She managed to convince me to also buy a cherry bag charm. It was so pretty though, it didn’t take much convincing.

I was influenced by Tanner Leatherstein’s videos and intrigued by the leather quality, especially since it’s made in Ubrique, Spain (I’m based in Italy, so I figured that would work in my favor).

Ordering & Delivery:

Ordered: October 26, 2024

Delivered: October 31, 2024 (Pretty quick!)

I'm no handbag or leather connoisseur, I just like what I like. That said:

✔ Pebbled leather: Gorgeous texture. ✔ That leather smell: The kind that instantly makes you appreciate the material quality. Intoxicating in the best way. ✔ Practical design: Nothing fancy, great for daytime use. ✔ Thoughtful extras: Came with a tote bag that doubled as a dust bag + a leather cord organizer—nice touch!

Overall Thoughts:

So far, I’m loving the quality and practicality of this bag. I initially bought it to match a pair of shoes, but I'm hoping to use it much more this spring and summer.

I bought this bag about 1.5 years ago from Nordstrom and I \*LOVE\* it.  I use it as a work bag and I put my everyday purse inside, plus a ton of other stuff I like to haul to work.  It said on the tags when I bought it that it basically can't be cleaned with any method.  Well, as expected, it's now dirty from daily use.  Do I risk trying to wash it in the sink with Dawn?  I'm not sure what the reasoning was behind stating it can't be cleaned, or what exactly bad will happen if it does get cleaned.  

It's recycled material like nylon that's puffy / quilted.  Advice?

Also is there a FAQ somewhere about cleaning / storing / caring for bags?  I don't have anything high end like some of you, but I would like tips on how to make my small collection last and look good as long as possible.

1k937dd,handbags,Coach cargo or Marc Jacob’s the tote bag?,"In about a month, I will be switching positions at my job, and I’ll be traveling to and from multiple different stores during my training period. So, I’ll need a bag that can carry all that I’ll need, hence why I’m between these two!

I do already have a coach cargo, but I have the 13.5x10 one. I was really going back and forth between that size or the 26, and ended up buying larger. It’s big, and it can fit a ton, but it’s almost too big lol, and really heavy when it’s full! It also can’t fit into a locker at work (retail), which will be a problem when I’m moving around and don’t have my own dedicated cabinet I can put it in, which is what I do now.

So, now I’m trying to decide on if I get the Coach cargo 26 or the Marc Jacob’s tote bag, and I’d love some help! I LOVE the lilac MJ, I like the shaping and the way it looks when being worn a bit better, and I like the price (my budget is small at the moment, so it has to be the canvas one - I wish I could get the leather) but my fear is that I’ve seen a lot of people say the canvas ones fade badly and quickly, and they don’t hold their shape? Is that accurate? If it is, I’d rather just grab the cargo in the smaller size…",2025-04-27 12:49:38+00:00,2,3
1k92yv5,handbags,Coach Empire 28 - HONEY (Erykah Badu voice),"I finally walked out of Coach with the bag I've been eyeing for months! The Empire 28 in Honey wasn't available my side of the 🌎 until about 2 weeks ago. I was debating whether to get this or the Loewe Puzzle, which is way more than I am truly comfortable spending. I popped into my local Coach and immediately said YES. Utimately, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase.

The Empire 28 is a dream- the leather is buttery, and the bag fits everything I need to carry outside my lunch without being heavy. The adjustable shoulder strap is the perfect width for support! I also love the addition of the snap close internal pocket, side straps that adjust to expand the purse width, and key leash (pic. 7).

I most likely would carry a smaller water bottle in this, but it was still comfortable with everything pictured on my outing today. With all my items, it still has some room to spare for travel wipes, small snacks, or whatever without a tight close.

Pictured inside (pic. 2 and 3):
- 20 oz Corksicle Sport Canteen
- Dagne Dover bag filled with toiletries (pic. 4)
- Boox E-Reader (7"")
- Anker battery pack
- earbuds
- packable shopping bag
- card wallet + keys

*I tried fitting my 10"" e-ink notebook (same measurements as my IPad- I left it at work). It fits but only if the bag is unzipped or filled with fewer small items and at the expense of stretching the zip panel upwards, which... should be fine long term? (pic. 5)

I learned with my purchase that Coach will color emboss or stamp a tag with any emoji and short word of your choice (pic. 6). Such a cute addition!",2025-04-27 12:36:41+00:00,26,1

1k8w9h4,handbags,"New purse alert! Chiikawa ""sling"" style bag","
After how well the Kirby bag went I've been more open to getting cute novelty/character bags (I used to be really hesitant, long story)

Imagine my excitement over finding this cute bag right after getting into Chiikawa! It was at Miniso for $15, which was a really good deal in my book because it's super cute and surprisingly practical. (I actually went to another Miniso the day after buying this one and found the $30 plush shoulder bag, definitely something for my *next* paycheck lol)

I've got a couple pictures of it in use, and one showing everything I was able to carry in it. (sorry for the blurry picture by the way) if you compare it to my last WIMB photo from the Kirby bag you'll see it holds nowhere near as much stuff but it carries the basics confidently along with a little extra space :) I of course took it with me grocery shopping- because that is how I test all of my new bags apparently- and to run some other errands.

Because no bag is flawless I did find a couple of problems with it but nothing deal breaking. The strap is kind of short for me, since I've always preferred a really long crossbody strap; I feel like all I really have to do is add more belting if it really gets annoying. The bag also isn't very trinket friendly; I had to put a key ring into part of the adjuster if I wanted to put anything on the outside of it, which kind of messes with the structure of the whole strap assembly so I made sure not to put anything too heavy. However overall I really like this bag! It looks really cute, it doesn't feel flimsy, and it holds a good amount of stuff for a day out. Plus, it's Chiikawa, which I'm just glad I was able to *find*.",2025-04-27 05:06:15+00:00,8,1

I’m so confused - I’m US based and the tariff need is obviously not great but I travel a lot (a lot) and I’m trying to understand how tax refunds, duty free, and currency strengths all work. 

So to start. I was recently in Asia (Singapore, Thailand, Philippines, China, Japan and Taiwan). In Taiwan I went to Gucci and the bag I wanted was 66190 NTD ($2034). In the US it was $2250 plus tax ($2490). Obviously a great deal but how to I research these things in advance so I know which country to purchase in before I’m just there? I was in so many and just randomly stopped in while there but if I could’ve prepped maybe would’ve picked another place like Japan ;)

Other threads here mentioned Netherlands has a high tax rate so a good place to shop. But if I’m being refunded tax, why does it matter what the rate is? I also read Paris and Italy are great places but isn’t the Euro strong against the dollar? So more expensive? Wouldn’t I go to a place like Poland where the Zloty is weak? But what’s to stop them from just raising their prices so it’s comparable to the US?

And how does duty free work? Is it a different price depending on the airport and country I’m in? 

I’m not trying to be an extreme penny pincher or get the absolute best deal ever, but I go to so many countries for personal (and work) I want to do my due diligence since …I’m there so why not. I’ve been through South America and East Africa and Asia this year already and headed to Europe soon (Poland, Austria, UK, Spain, Portugal, Belgium), Canada, and back to Asia again so I’m trying to decide where and when I should be looking for handbags and how to understand pricing structures, currencies and all that works so I’m not flying so blind.

1k8oj51,handbags,Brooklyn but better?,"Hey all! Help me out on this quest for a unicorn.

I really love the Coach Brooklyn 39, but I am not loving any of the color options. I tend to favor really bold, statement colors that make it easy for me to notice where I’ve put my bag (I work remote 3 days a week and only 2 in office, where we “hotel” workstations, so I am almost never in the same desk.) I also just have a very vibrant personality and tend to like bright colors. Current bag is Kelly green, have had reds, pinks and blues in the past.

Any suggestions on a bag with similar shape in fun color options? I’d like to be able to toss in my laptop, but also have it be small enough that I can use it as a regular purse, not just a work bag. Also, wish the Brooklyn had more pockets for organization. 

Would love all your thoughts!",2025-04-26 22:07:16+00:00,3,3
1k8o4a7,handbags,My Favorite Vintage Straw Bag,"I got this secondhand & it’s become one of my favorite spring/summer bags. I’m guessing it’s 60s/70s but I’m not positive.

attached is the screenshot from the seller- i’m not sure how to feel about the response.

I believe it’s real because the quality is excellent-the logo and hardware are pretty and heavy. I also looked at inside pics online, and none of them showed a serial number, so maybe the Amanda doesn’t have one?

* NOT from a big-name US brand (e.g no Chanel, Dior, Louis Vuitton, Goyard, etc.). \*\*I don't mind if the brand is popular in other countries. 

**What brands or bags do y'all recommend?**

I have been considering:

1. *Strathberry* \- Tanner Leatherstein made a video on its high quality, and its a great price point. The hardware bar features are unique & fun. 
2. *Mulberry -* I know these are really well known in the UK, but I've heard the leather is top notch. 

Bags to pass on:

1. *Aspinal of London*: I've ready they have poor quality control. For the price, I don't know if it is worth the risk. 
2. *Polene*: Reddit talked me out of it. Decline in quality. 
3. *The Row:* Heard quality has gone down. Also not seeing any unique designs. Feels like I'd end up with a bag that looks like the others she already has, but for a really high price. 
4. *Joseph Dulcas, Moynat, Devalaux, Valextra:* These are a bit out of my price range, & I do wonder if they are truly higher quality or.. just higher priced & on the ""quiet luxury"" trend. 
5. *Peter Nitz:* I love the idea of a bespoke purse for her but don't have a design or shape in mind. Pocketing this for another day.

The bags aren't special. They're made from cowhide by a former Hermes leatherworker. I just love the history and seeing how they've aged compared with actual Hermes products. The external sewing is great but drpending on the product, the leather can be dry.

I found a vintage reseller with low prices and asked if he had any bags in colors in large sizes. He did, but he demanded _7 times the actual price_!!! So, for a bag that is typically 300, he requested I pay 2k (which is _more_ than a vintage Hermes bag).

1k8efc1,handbags,"My humble ""I just need a lil treat"" purchase","This is not nearly as nice as so many of the beautiful bags I see here, but I still wanted to share! I'm currently squirreling away my fun money for a higher tier bag purchase, but I recently graduated from my group therapy program (DBT gang rise up) and needed to scratch the ""I just need a lil treat"" itch really badly. I wanted to keep it under $80, and didn't have a very specific vision in mind for what I wanted. I figured I'd know it when I saw it! I had a rough idea that I'd love a daily carry that somehow still fit my laptop for coffee shop trips, but it wasn't a must-have.

When I ran into this Anne Klein bag, I immediately loved the shape and strap. Plus, it was organized inside with an attached center pouch. As a lifelong crossbody gal, I've never owned a shoulder bag before, but I couldn't believe how comfortable and wearable it was! My only concern was that Anne Klein is totally ""my mom's brand"" and I had to text a friend some pics to make sure it was as cool as I thought it was. She has impeccable style and validated how cute it is, so I went for it!

It's become my new daily carry, and I've used it every day since getting it. I'm shocked at how put-together and elevated it makes me feel, even when I'm just in my gym clothes with no makeup. It fits SO much in it while still being able to snap closed and hold it's slouchy little shape. It also does fit my laptop!

My only major complaint is that I certainly wish it was real leather. It was only $40, so I'm not stressed if it doesn't last me that long, but I would totally spend way more on an exact match for this bag in high-quality leather. I feel like I unlocked a totally new style of bag for myself, now that I know I can love wearing a bigger shoulder bag every day.

I added the chain myself—it was something I already had collecting dust at home—but I think it's a really nice touch of hardware.

1k84gei,handbags,What I ordered vs what I received,"About a month ago I became obsessed with The Attico’s La Passeggiata bag. The chocolate croc skinned version that went viral was already sold out but I decided that I liked the burgundy pebbled version better. I went to buy it but backed out because it’s such a big purchase and I didn’t want to do it on a whim. The next day the bag sold out and I was crushed.

It turned out to be a good thing because by the way I completely obsessed over the bag, I knew that I really wanted her. Last week I got the email notification it was back in stock and I pulled the trigger right away. My birthday is in May and it’s my early birthday present to myself.

Today my bag arrived and lo and behold, when I opened the box I see not the burgundy pebbled leather that I ordered but the chocolate croc skinned.

I should say that I also loved this version and after the burgundy went out of stock I debated long and hard if I would get the chocolate or burgundy whenever they came back in stock. The burgundy won mainly because the chocolate is more expensive and I have other dark brown bags while I don’t have a burgundy yet.

I was shocked to receive this bag but in a good way. I mean, it’s $260 more expensive than what I paid so it feels like I got a double birthday present lol. Also, the pictures don’t do this bag justice. It is absolutely gorgeous in person. I wasn’t sure if I would like the croc style leather (another reason I didn’t pick it) but I love the look and feel of it in person.

Sorry my story is so long but I’m so happy and I have no one to share it with. Also, I realize that it may not be ethical for me to keep this bag when I didn’t pay the full price for it. And I realize if it was the other way around and they sent me the cheaper bag when I paid for the expensive one, I’d be pretty upset and would probably contact the company. But…the bag is here and I love it. It came in such an enormous box and it would really be a pain to ship it back out to Italy, just to receive another enormous box if they exchange it. Can I just say that fate intervened and gave me the bag that was meant for me? 🥹

P.S. I’m truly sorry if someone ordered this and opened their package to find my pebbled burgundy one.",2025-04-26 04:18:38+00:00,751,71

I wanted something that’s black, silver or gunmetal hardware, edgy/unique enough to fit my personal style but still appropriate for the occasional trip to the office or a client’s office, and able to fit my kindle in its sleeve in addition to the usual necessities. My current everyday option is a 10 year old bucket bag with gold hardware and desperately needs replacing. All my other bags are either colors or season specific, and I haven’t even bought a new purse in almost 5 years. I started a new milestone job late last year and (after recovering financially from a long search post-layoff), I’m finally ready to treat myself!

I happened across Hammitt last night (never heard of it before) and fell in love with like half of their styles. I’ve narrowed it down to these two options, but I’m stuck. I love the look of both equally. I like the functionally of the two straps on the clutch (pics 1-2) more, but I like the size on the fold crossbody (pics 3-4) more. (The clutch does come in a large size, but it feels more masculine/messenger bag in that size which I don’t like). I feel like I need other opinions to help me decide which one!

1k7ujs0,handbags,The hype is real,"Been agonizing over a new work travel bag that’s durable but also more classy and “adult” since for years I traveled with commuter backpacks. Picked up the Coach Empire 40 in Honey today and she is stunning. Did the hot stamp as well and got the tag embossed with my initials which was a cool process and I didn’t realize was complimentary. 


It looked like they had overall less items in the store, which I asked the SA about and she said  that location in particular is piloting a program where they are only stocking best sellers/most popular items. Apparently it’s been so busy lately they also have been selling things like crazy. We both agreed that Coach is definitely in its comeback era. ",2025-04-25 20:08:44+00:00,480,54
1k7uj6u,handbags,Happiest girl in the world - thanks to this sub,"A Prada Galleria has been my dream bag for probably 15 years. I missed out on buying one like 12 years ago because it was just out of my budget. I settled for a different Prada at a slightly lower price point. It wasn’t a mistake… but it’s a regret. I never stopped wanting the Galleria, while the price climbed and climbed and climbed. 

I have a tab to the Prada website permanently open on my phone and I look at this bag regularly. 

To make a long story short, there was a post on here recently about Fashionphile. I’ve never been comfortable buying pre-loved, but was considering it because I couldn’t find a DIFFERENT bag (Dolce & Gabbana Sicily). I did some research on Fashionphile, felt comfortable with their products and policies, then went hunting for the Sicily. 

No luck, but I thought I’d see what Gallerias were available.

Lo and behold I found my dream bag: right size, right colour, all accessories included (including the original auth card).

I sat on it for a few days. I recently bought a yellow bag, and I wound up buying the Sicily new - surely I didn’t need ANOTHER bag in such a short timeframe?!

Well, apparently the answer is I DO need another bag and I’ve never been happier. I can’t believe it’s finally here after so many years, and it’s just the perfect bag for me. 

The colour is fantastic in person and for a used bag, it’s in fantastic condition. I went out and bought leather cleaner and conditioner in preparation for its arrival, so I scrubbed off some marks that I knew were there from the photos. There is a little scuffing on the bottom, but it doesn’t bother me - it seems like this bag wasn’t used much by its previous owner and it turned up in better condition than I expected.

With taxes, this bag now retails for ~$7,000CAD new, and as much as I love it, I can’t justify spending that much on one item. The bag cost $1600 CAD on the site, and import duties were an eye-watering $660 (warning to anyone else importing from Fashionphile!!).

I’m grateful to this sub and to the community of handbag lovers sharing their appreciation and knowledge of bags. I’m happy to have learned about Fashionphile, I’m happy with the price I paid, and I’m happy to read all the stories from others who buy used because you helped me bring my dream home!! Thank you!! ❤️❤️❤️",2025-04-25 20:08:04+00:00,345,47

1k7pt4z,handbags,Help me choose my birthday present / suggest laptop totes please!,"Hello! My partner has given me a budget of around $300 for a birthday present bag after I've complained all year about things running together in the current tote I have. 


Reqs: Preferably leather, sturdy, feet on bottom, thicker straps, black, compartment for 14"" laptop (against side of bag, not in middle), ideally also some pockets for sunglasses, cards, etc. A zipper is preferable to a magnetic clasp, but either is acceptable. Bonuses: phone pocket on backside, water bottle slot.


I am not super flashy or fashionable and would love something black that will go with all my outfits - from casual to slightly nicer skirts or sundresses. I will be using it for school / work, so laptop, food (small, square glass container or two), and water bottle need to fit. 


Current ones I have found that I like:


Frëya Linnea Tote: Prob my least fave as there isn't a completely separate compartment for the laptop and it is just separated down the middle. 


Pond La Transform Tote: Some hesitation over quality as I couldn't find too much info, but has almost everything I want plus my bonuses! Not a huge fan of the look as it seems dull?


Lambert Danyka Tote: Also has everything plus bonuses but is only available in brown, sadly. Idk how well brown will match with things like black does. 


Von Baer Elegance Tote: Dream Bag. Outside of the budget sadly, but it is gorgeous and exactly what I am looking for. 


Please help me pick and / or suggest other totes that fit my desires! Thank-you!

1k7n2qi,handbags,Help me chose a bag for my 40th birthday,"My 40th birthday is coming up, and I want to celebrate with a new handbag. I'm also expecting my first child the month after I turn 40, so it feels like an even more meaningful milestone. Please help me chose a bag!

The two options I have in mind are the Bottega Small Andiamo and Loewe Medium Flamenco. I know the price points on these are pretty different, so I am also looking into pre-loved, especially for the Bottega. Not set on the colors since I haven't looked at these in person, but I don't tend to wear black or pure white bags (I have/had some but they never get picked up) so want to avoid those colors.

Some requirements and considerations:

- The bags I have are either smaller bags that carry just daily essentials (cardholder, phone, keys plus a few smaller things) or larger totes that haul everything. I'm looking for a bag that would carry the daily essentials and maybe a few larger things, like a book or a small water bottle. Probably not going to be using this as a diaper bag.

- Straps need to be comfortable to wear, especially if I carry more. I'm too old to sacrifice comfort over style.

- I tend to carry bags either in my hand, the crook of my arm, or crossbody. Shoulder bags tend to slip off my shoulder and I find that uncomfortable (except for larger totes for some reason?).

- I dress pretty casually but still like to look put together.

Also, if there are other options I should look into that would fit in this category, would love to hear your thoughts! ",2025-04-25 15:00:08+00:00,111,106

I’m a 5’4” girly and a chronic overpacker. I used to carry an oversized organized tote by ADAMO but it’s been taken over by my med student sister that traumatized it with her heavy textbooks. 

I’m looking for smth OVERSIZED and sturdy. Think: law student, on the go 24/7, always carrying my life on my shoulder. 

I need a large, comfortable, stylish bag that can handle my workout clothes, sneakers, a lunchable bento, two light textbooks, ipad pro, glasses case, chargers/headphones, and a pouch FULL of everything i need (makeup, toiletries, misc).

What I want:
	•	~35L capacity or more
	•	Not shoulder-pain-inducing
	•	Structured bottom or separate shoe compartment a huge bonus
	•	Has some grunge/edgy vibes but still wearable daily
	•	Durable material that won’t stain easily (not floppy cloth!)
	•	Can double as a personal item for travel

Would love recs for something in the vibe of the Balenciaga City bag (oversized leather version) or Dagne Dover Large Carryall but with more edge or personality. it has to look cute with a jacket on! I live in wintery weather so straps that doesn’t fall off the shoulder is needed.

I love the clean lines and timeless feel, but I definitely can’t afford a Birkin.

Ideally, I’d like something:
	•	Around 20–25 cm in size
	•	With a top handle (a crossbody strap is a nice bonus but not essential)
	•	In Togo or similarly durable leather
	•	With a minimalist style, no big logos
	•	That falls into the mid-range price bracket (not designer-tier, but good quality)

I already own the Balenciaga Rodeo, which I adore, but it scratched quite easily, so I’m looking for something a bit more hard-wearing. Not interested in the Fendi Peekaboo – it’s just not my style.

Any suggestions for quality, structured bags from contemporary or even under-the-radar brands? I’d love to hear what you all recommend!",2025-04-25 09:22:38+00:00,19,69
1k7gm2w,handbags,Language Barrier?,"**ETA:** **I take it all back! The company has promptly responded to me on repeated occasions, and just approved my return. Plus, they amazingly got the order delivered to my door less than 48 hours after I made my online purchase ... shipped from Hong Kong to Florida. Way to go, Rabeanco!!!!**

I got all excited and bought a designer handbag and wallet recently from a non-English-dominant company. I got an unexpected treat when I added the items to my online shopping bag and they were automatically discounted. Score! However .... when the items arrived, I was underwhelmed. For various reasons, I'm having buyer's remorse, and would like to return them.

The company return policy states: *""No Question Asked Exchange could be made within 30-Day from the date of delivery when the item is still brand new un-used and could be re-packed in its original packaging.""* Great; that describes these items.

I have messaged the company about how to process a return, but they are repeatedly telling me, *""Discounted and Sales items from the Outlet are not eligible for return.""* My issues with this statement are twofold:

(1) I did not buy anything from the Outlet section, and their sentence clearly states that discounts *and* sales are referring to Outlet items. If they actually mean that **nothing** from their website can be returned if bought at a reduced or sale price, why specify ""from the Outlet""?

(2) Absolutely EVERYTHING on their website is automatically discounted when things are added to the online shopping bag. Again, if they actually mean that nothing can be returned if bought at a reduced or sale price, their practice of automatic discounting is giving the impression that they don't want **anything** returned. To me, this is a dishonest retail practice.

Am I overthinking this? Is this a simple language barrier? Can I fight this? Advice please.",2025-04-25 09:20:28+00:00,0,4

1k79w9n,handbags,Final sale Staud Tommy Bag arrived with many missing beads and loose threads- store won’t grant a return and I’m not sure what to do,"Basically as the title said, I recently splurged on this bag after eyeing it for a while. I bought off the platform Garmentory which allows stores to list their items there. It’s my understanding that this purse originated from a boutique in California. The listing did not note that the item was used in any way and the listing used the original pictures off the Staud website. I even purchased shipping protection as this was a big purchase for me and I live in an area with porch pirates.

I first filed a claim with the shipping protection as the box arrived somewhat damaged so I thought that may have been the cause, but my claim was denied for “insufficient evidence”. I have been trying to work with the platform and have been emailing back and forth for nearly a week now. I have been offered two options:

1. Return the purse to the boutique and receive an exchange for any item(s) at the same price of the purse. This doesn’t interest me as they don’t have the same purse available nor anything that I would feel comfortable spending $250 on

2. A 10% refund

I’m not sure how to move forward at this point. Normally I would eat the cost, but considering this was advertised as a new purse, I don’t feel comfortable doing that. If anyone has been in a similar situation and has any advice, I’d really appreciate it

1k73bg0,handbags,It's not really worth buying luxury bags from Neiman Marcus or maybe even other department stores,"This is more of a rant/cautionary tale although we've had a handful of these already on this subreddit.

I feel that it's not really worth buying luxury bags at Neiman Marcus. You're spending the same money that you would at a boutique and you are getting an overall worse experience and partially used product. At least in my experience/perspective.

Why would I spend $4,000+/- on a display bag that has all these makeup stains on it, when I could just get a better experience and more well taken care of product at the boutique? It honestly leaves the customer looking like a fool in the end. Like Neiman's is playing in our faces, and I just don't think it's worth it anymore for me to buy luxury/designer purses there.

Thoughts? Similar experiences - having to deal with spending retail on used products and going through a merry go round of customer support to just feel overall unsatisfied in the end?

Edit: I went into Neiman's where the bag I wanted was the last in the store. They told me to order online to get a fresh one. I did that, and they just sent me the display one from the store I visited. I exchanged and ordered online again. They sent another store's display bag with even more makeup stains on it.

1k718sc,handbags,Parisa Wang Grace Bag 🤩,"Recently I ordered the Grace top handle bag - Eve in Cream from Parisa Wang. I have my eyes on this brand for quite some time. I’m very aware of all the issues that other people reported about this brand but still made the jump 😅


It was shipped on April 6th and arrived on April 10th. I did suffer buyer remorse after placing the online order, and did request to cancel it if possible. And I received an email reply from customer service, saying they can not cancel my order because it has already been shipped, and that i can always return if i dont like it. So i would say ok good job for the responsive customer support. At least they dont ghost me 😅


Pros: i really like the bag design. I think it’s really elegant, can go for office or formal parties. The leather is soft. The cream color is not too white or bright, which works nicely with my outfit. Hardware is nice. Everything was carefully wrapped when it arrived.


Cons: I do also agree about the pushing to close the flap is a bit annoying but not a big deal. Also like someone reported, the bag has some smell. I hope it will fade over time. I own APC bags and they smell much better (not sure why?). And also like someone reported, the bag does get heavy and can feel heavy on the shoulder.


Overall i’m happy with this purchase ☺️. I would recommend buying while there’s a sale as well.

1k70zvq,handbags,Looking to upgrade sporty crossbody bag,"Hi Everyone! I’m looking for a better sporty crossbody/belt bag/fanny pack that can be worn across the body. I work in fitness so I use this thing a lot. I love the one I have aesthetically but 1. The strap length adjuster doesn’t stay put so it just gets looser and looser every day, and 2. I feel like maybe the fact that it hangs from this hardware makes it not stay across the front of my body very well? It’s always migrating to my hip, which gets on my nerves. I was thinking maybe something where the strap is sewn to the sides like a fanny pack would work better.

I posted a pic of the current bag. The size is great—a little bigger would be nice, smaller would be prob be too small. I don’t want black because so much of my athletic wear is black already.

1k6x641,handbags,Exchanged the Gucci Horsebit for Gucci Go,"I had the Horsebit for 1 night and decided to exchange because of a little scratch. When I exchanged for a new piece, the SA let me know that the horsebit is prone to scratches. I'm afraid to carry a bag that I will baby so he suggested some alternatives. The alternatives were Blondie and the Go designs. 

In the end, I went home with Gucci Go because I feel like the fabric is not that high maintenance as the pure leather. The SA  also mentioned that Go would maybe suit me more as I dress plainly. A pop of color and a flashier/statement bag would elevate my usual look. That's in contrast with the more classic and casual look of the Horsebit. 

Between the two, Horsebit is more spacious and easier to open and close. If only the Horsebit has a bigger top handle, I think I would still keep it even though its leather is prone to scratches. 

Go is cute tho. I hope I made the right choice :)


Ps. Can i use the store credit to buy Gucci perfume or can I just use it for bags?

1. Chanel with top handle unused, JPY 1,080,000
Slightly exceeded my budget but I can be flexible if it's the right bag. I can use this both as a shoulder bag and clutch bag because of the top handle.

2. Chanel with adjustable strap unused, JPY 838,000
I like how the strap can be adjusted but not sure if the dangling of the end of the strap is cute or annoying.

3. Vintage Chanel, grade B but very good quality, JPY 498,000.

i’m definitely a maximalist and love the concept of bag charms, but i think what deterred me for so long was seeing bag charms that seemed to have no rhyme or reason as far as color coordinating or placement that made sense with the bag’s structure. once i started toying with them on my Loewe Puzzle, i finally get the hype.

i tried to keep many of the items neutral to go with the gray of the bag (my favorite being the acrylic chain from Coach in colors that i think matches perfectly), but once i added the Japanese good luck charm my boyfriend got me from Japan, i decided to add some pops of pink and yellow with the Cinnamoroll and the Labubu. i also threw on some mixed metals (including one of my favorite keychains from Coach of a dragon holding a pearl) and ended up loving the juxtaposition of masculine and feminine that ended up happening.

First impression - 
- I love the color (emerald) and size. The leather is a bit stiff but not a deal breaker. 
- It’s a bit cumbersome to put the crossbody strap on, probably because I’m so used to straps that just clip on. Again, not a deal breaker but maybe they will change this in future iterations 
of the bag. 
- I know the shape of it doesn’t let it just “sit”, like you have to lean it against something but I do wish the base was a bit more flat so that you can sit it on a table or counter, etc. 
- Lastly, I don’t love that the flap has a different color underneath, like you can see the lighter color in the picture with the crossbody strap. 

I haven’t worn it out so I’m sure there will be many more things I love about this bag but just some quick thoughts on it so far. 

For those that have the bag, are there any other quirks that I need to be mindful of? It’s a beauty for sure and it’s so affordable, I can’t really complain (even though it may seem like I am 😬😅). ",2025-04-23 20:48:56+00:00,122,20

I’m starting this thread to gather and document customer issues with Think Olives bags —including delayed orders, poor product quality, unresponsive customer service, or unresolved refunds.

I’ve had a negative experience myself and will be submitting a report to the FTC. If you’ve encountered similar problems, I'm happy to help to report them on your behalf as well. The more accurate and detailed your input, the stronger our collective voice.

From what I’ve experienced and seen so far, Think Olives appears to be a dropshipping store. They claim to be from the US but their products are shipped from China, often with very slow delivery times and disappointing quality. Many of the items look and feel like they cost no more than $5, far below what’s advertised.

If you'd like to share, please comment below with:

1. Order Number
2. Date of Purchase
3. Brief Description of the Issue

This thread is also meant to help others find honest reviews and avoid the same frustrations. They have been taking down my reviews on their social media and other review websites so I hope the mods will defend this post when it’s requested to be taken down by them.

It’s over budget at $2550 plus tax at Nordstrom, but sites like Farfetch, Modesens and Savannah’s (Cettire and Lyst I think are pulling from Savannah’s, which is a boutique in Stockholm) have it on sale duties included for about $1870 plus a first time buyer 15% off. I don’t think it’s used, and they offer 30-day returns. But I’m always leery of things sounding too good to be true and that’s a pretty big price difference.

I did see this bag in Rome in January 2025 when it was just introduced, so maybe the discounted bag cd be older inventory in Europe whereas Nords and other US stores might have only gotten it more recently? 

I don’t want to spend $2500+ but am willing if it’s in that $1800ish range. Thoughts on the reliability of these other sites? Thx

1k5nz3k,handbags,My collection since December,"Please excuse my photos, I don't have the patience to arrange things beautifully. Recently got into handbags after not really carrying one for years. This sub has been super helpful in leading me to find some beautiful bags. The only thing I regret is the black Strathberry tote. Even though I love dressing colorfully, I somehow thought I wanted a black evening bag. Turns out it does nothing for me. I also got a \[silk scarf from Strathberry\](https://us.strathberry.com/products/silk-skinny-scarf-vanilla-pop-art-print) but didn't consider that the part of the design I love is hidden when wrapped. I need to work on tying it into a bow so that I can see the pretty bits. It has been fun figuring out what I like and don't like. I know my friends are sick of my sending them pictures of bags so I'm coming here to gush.   


I also have a bunch of bags from when I actually carried purses stored at my mother's since I didn't take any when I moved. I've already asked her to mail them to me! I have a (now) vintage green Dooney that I especially want. 

  


For my next moves:

I really want a piece from \[Aspinal\](https://www.aspinaloflondon.com/products/midi-london-woven-leather-tote-bag-in-merlot-woven-leather), but with the price increases due to tariffs I'll wait until I visit my brother in London



I looove the scales/jacquard from Faure Le Page. There are so many pieces that I like so I want to see what calls to me in person. I will be in Asia in the fall so I'm considering a day trip to SG or KL to visit a boutique.



And then this \[Couieria Fiorentina\](https://www.cuoieriafiorentina.it/us/small-tote-bag-4306.html) is calling to me. The only thing stopping me is I want to sit on designs to see if I still want them after a bit since I'm feeling pretty satisfied with my collection so far! As we get closer to summertime I will revisit!

* Kate Spade small Madison in yellow (my first purchase in December! I visited this sub to get ideas when I decided I wanted some new purses. I saw someone post a two toned blue one that her husband gifted her and it was so cute!)

1k5mycr,handbags,Upgrading the Uniqlo Round Mini Shoulder Bag,"I like bags, and I have a lot of nice ones.  Yet, I am inexplicably constantly grabbing the Uniqlo nylon bag as a easy hands free crossbody.  I love the shape, it's the perfect size and I like that the strap can be a true crossbody or almost a chest strap sort of bag if I want it tighter.  I've used it on planes, hikes, trips, ect.  However, it's pretty casual.  I brought it as my one and only bag for a recent Japan trip since we had some hikes, a lot of walking and more nature-y activities planned.  I was trying to be pragmatic about packing (aka leaving a lot of space in luggage to buy stuff once there).  I realized though that while it's kind of my ideal bag for any activity that involves a lot of walking or moving around where I don't need a larger bag I do wish it was a bit less casual so it's better for a day to night transition.  I'm envisioning basically a nice leather version of ect the same shape and size in a neutral color.  Any suggestions? 

Other bags I own are Loewe, vintage Bottega, DeMellier, Cuyana.  I tend to use the Bottega hobo and Cuyana tote (my work bag) most often. Every bag I own is black or tan.  I am boring. ",2025-04-23 01:13:56+00:00,8,5

1. Obviously the Goyard St Louis PM bag. I'm thinking one of the blues, maybe the Navy blue so it will be nice in winter too. I know ppl have mixed feeling about this but honestly, it fits the bill above. I'm looking for alternatives or recs before i pull the trigger on that one.
2. I've been considering the Chanel shopping tote (photographed) I heard it's heavy but I'm not out and about everyday so it's fine. I just worry if theyre real since I can't buy it new.

I have a quick question about a Miu Miu wallet I recently repurchased.
I bought the same model last summer and returned it, but I couldn’t stop thinking about the color – so when it came back in stock, I ordered it again.

Now here’s my issue: the wallet has this weird little “leather end” in one spot

Is this normal for Miu Miu leather goods? Has anyone else experienced this? I can’t tell if I’m being too picky or if this is a reason to return it.

Would love your input – thanks in advance!

(1 pic last summer, 2,3,4 are from the wallet right now)

I just received my purchase of this Coccinelle shoulder bag and it’s quite clear it’s different than it was presented on the website. Don’t get me wrong, this bag is still beautiful and in great shape, but the listing specially stated the bag is “black leather”, and the photos give the appearance of a soft black. However, upon receiving the bag, it is very clearly a high gloss gunmetal/silver leather. Now looking at the listing photos and the bag in person, I can definitely see how it’s possible in a certain light the bag appears closer to black in those photos. But the description of the bag is still very much says “black”. I’m annoyed at myself, because in their defense I probably could have looked closer at those photos, and realized it’s a sort of metallic grey rather than a treated black leather. 
I’m thinking I will keep this bag since it is quite nice but I likely wouldn’t have purchased it in the first place if they had accurately described it as silver. ",2025-04-22 17:14:41+00:00,64,30

1k58o8v,handbags,Chanel Glazed Calfskin or Distressed Patent?,"Hey everyone, I recently purchased a pre-loved Chanel 2.55 Reissue bag and am looking for some thoughts on the material.

I never planned on ever really considering a Chanel bag due to the price, but I found what I think was a great deal for this one on Fashionphile so I jumped on it. ($2,150 for a 227 size & had original box)

They listed it as an ""Aged Glazed Calfskin"" bag, and from my bit of googling, that seemed probably right? But when I received it last week I noticed it looks a lot like the ""distressed patent"" Reissue bags that Fashionphile has on their website.

So can anyone enlighten me as to how to tell the difference? Up to now I've only heard of typical smooth patent leather, not ""distressed"" patent.

I love the bag, the color is amazing, it's better condition than expected and luckily it was no financial strain to buy. But it was still a good chunk of money, so I'm struggling a bit to commit to keeping it especially since I'm not totally sure they labeled it right.


Overall I guess I'm just trying to make sure I got what I paid for and that I know what I have so I can care for it properly. (Tips on that part are also appreciated, lol.)

I’ve been wanting to get my girlfriend a bag for awhile now and through hints I’ve found out she wants either a GOYARD Artois PM or a Loewe Hammock Hobo (with the branded Loewe strap) LOL.

With that said, the price difference only being a few hundred, what would be a better option for an everyday use? She already has a bigger Tom Ford and Balenciaga Tote which is why she wanted something smaller.

I ordered it and I just cannot convert to the shoulder bag cult - I’m sorry I want to but I just can’t. I went to the outlet near me to return it and decided to browse. 

There was this absolutely adorable Lucasta crossbody in True Blue Tonal that another salesperson was messing with and I had my eye on it. They were talking about how someone called to see if they had one in store, blah blah blah. My return finishes and I see it on the shelf, put out for sale. 

It gets better: it had this *adorable* floral embroidery. I had to get it. I absolutely could not resist. It was so extremely CUTE! I went to the Kate Spade outlet and checked out that neat flower bouquet bag but it was $281 - on sale 🥲. This Kipling was only $48 and some change! The flowers are white and yellow (hard to see in the first pic, a little better in the second). 

The bag itself was $32 but the embroidery was $16 so = $48!!!!Embroidered names are $10 and designs are $15-18. I’m hella debating on taking my two current kiplings to have them embroidered.

1k4ygd0,handbags,Is it Mandela effect or did Louis Vuitton make their bags with all leather at one point?,"A few months ago, I went to the Louis store and SA said all the bags are made of coated canvas and only the handle and tag areas are made of real leather. She said it has always been this way. Sure enough when I looked it up online, it’s true they are all made of coated canvas, and it has always been that way. There’s no record of it being fully leather But why did I remember otherwise? 🤔
I could’ve sworn I read something that said what made Louis Vuitton so sought after was the leather that they use but also I was pretty young then and could be remembering this all wrong. 

A late relative of mine has passed me down a vintage Louis Alma bag most likely from early 2000. I could tell it was used often enough to patina.  But the bag was in perfect condition and it has this really nice sheen to it. Almost as if it’s real leather. But I don’t know if it actually is it could just be a very good coated canvas.  After all, things were probably just made better back then. I don’t know… 

 I compared it to my multi pochette I got in 2021 and an Odeon in 2022 both looked so dull comparison to the vintage one. I then looked for the Alma at the store and it was just the same as my 2 bags. 
People, tell me it’s because my bags are still too new. 
I have tried wearing my bags out, I put stuff inside them, put them out by the window by the sun. Even the tiniest bit of baby oil to see if it would shine and it does a little but it wipes right off and it’s back to looking dry. 
 The leather did patina on the pochette. The Odeon is black leather, but, neither of them got that same sheen on the bag part. And since it’s coated canvas, as my SA said I’m not sure that it ever will change and get that same sheen. But this makes me wonder what are vintage bags made of that l give them this shiny look? If it’s not real leather then what is it? And why don’t they use it anymore? 
Other than this vintage bag from 2000s I have no others to really compare it to. Does anyone else notice a sheen on vintage Louis bags  ? ",2025-04-22 05:09:49+00:00,1,18

1k4x1gw,handbags,Anya Hindmarch Eyes,"A few years back, I went to London and thought the Anya Hindmarch eyes collection was so cute. Idk if l'd consider them luxury but they're a designer brand, so I'm posting here. Anyways, I started getting targeted ads for them and was reminded of how cute they are. But here's the thing... I wear leather purses because I'm not a fan of nylon. The brand has moved away from leather in an effort to be more environmentally friendly (my hunch is that they have a higher profit margin using synthetic materials like nylon instead of leather).

So, if I want a purse from that collection, my main options are to purchase a nylon bag from the site or a leather bag secondhand. The older designs are honestly cuter I like the leather look and the bigger googly eyes) and I wish they were still being made.

I could purchase a bag on P0shmark, but l've never done it before. The one I'm eying says ""used"" and “excellent"" condition. I’m unsure if I can trust second hand. What if it has a weird smell? My other concern is that the longer I wait, there will be less bags available for resale since they aren't being made anymore.

I’m debating if I should purchase a nylon bag straight from their site or buy a leather one second hand. I’m thinking the leather would be better quality.

What occasions do you use your bags for? I think they look fun but idk how practical. How do they hold up? Would love any insights about the quality of this brand!",2025-04-22 03:46:19+00:00,3,3

My current purse is a baggallini Modern Everywhere in midnight blossom. I like almost everything about it except that it is *slightly* too big, and it looks like a diaper bag, and the color choices and prints are very limited

Here is my wishlist/needs:
- good in rain
- lightweight
- good zippers
- crossbody
- specific place for water bottle that won't get other stuff wet if it has condensation 
- phone can be put in side pocket and zipped in if needed
-  I need to carry small bottles of soap, lotion, and hand sanitizer due to allergies, plus a couple pill bottles, wallet, key fob, sunglasses, baby wipes.

I only want one purse. I don't care about brand names, but will pay for quality. I'm fine with $20 off Amazon or $200+ for something significantly better.

Need some opinions! 

I’m in the market for a slouchy leather backpack, small-medium sized. I am a 5’9, 180 pound male— so something that is not too big, but also not toooo small.. 

Will be an everyday bag that I can use after work and on weekends, vs carrying a tote bag. I’m having trouble finding a nice one in a small-medium size… trying to avoid a sling pack, not really my style. 

Pics would be great! Recommendations please 🥹

(for reference; I have the Jansport half pint mini backpack and it’s a bit tooo small)",2025-04-21 18:08:06+00:00,1,2

1k4j5ma,handbags,Help me decide pleeease,"Looking to buy a new bag and I’m paralyzed by having to choose between the Gucci Jackie medium and Loewe flamenco medium (the new design). With the VAT refund and cheaper prices in Europe, even if I declare when returning home I’ll save roughly 1300 CAD for the Jackie and 1600 CAD for the flamenco (if my math is correct haha). They are both so gorgeous and I can’t decide. Would love to hear from those of who own either/both of these bags about your experience. If it helps, here’s what I look for in a bag:
- I don’t want to have to baby the bag and would prefer it to not be prone to scratches and marks
- easy to access the contents of the bag. I have reservation about the Jackie because of this, does it get annoying to have to unclasp and clasp it every time?
- amount of stuff that can fit into the bag, the more the better

Thank you in advance for your input ☺️

1k4hhno,handbags,The best work backpack EVER!!! Lux & Nyx Origami Backpack review,"So I work in corporate, and I commute a lot, go on a lot of meetings, work trips, all that fun stuff. I used to be strictly a tote girl, but around a year ago, I finally gave in to the backpack life at work so I could be hands-free. Way better for commuting and going around, honestly.

My problem is, most backpacks that are actually useful (aka the ones that can carry your whole life) just... don't work. They don't look good enough for facing clients and super important people at work. And when I carry a lot of stuff for trips they make me feel like a kid on her first day of elementary school. The ones that do look great just lack the features I need. They just serve looks and that's basically it.

I tried a few backpacks including the Timbuk2 Authority a friend gave me, and the Everlane ReNew (thanks mom! got it from her last Christmas). They're both pretty solid, but they didn't really hit the professional but chic vibe I was going for.

And then everything changed when I discovered this backpack. It's gorgeous and it's everything I needed!!

It's the Lux & Nyx Origami Backpack
luxandnyx.com/products/origami-daily-backpack/?variant=48329623339310

Pic was from when I unboxed it!! I’ve been using it for weeks now, including a recent work trip, and it still looks brand-new. I’ve already gotten LOTS of compliments on it.

It's mind-blowing how it fits so much inside without looking or feeling bulky or too big. There’s a laptop compartment, so many pockets, including a hidden one in the front (it's my favorite ever) and it even slides onn my luggage handle so it's so easy to travel with. AND it miraculously doesn’t kill my shoulders or back. So comfy!

Also, the little card that came with it talking about its story and features was a cute touch.

This is my first bag from this brand and definitely not my last. They have a matching fanny pack in the same origami design that I now obviously need because I have no self-control when I fall in love with a brand lol

I super recommend this bag if any of you are looking for a work backpack that's actually pretty and knows what you need!!!",2025-04-21 16:21:38+00:00,1,2

You can ask questions about specific bags that don’t require an entire  review to see if anyone has the answer!

We are doing this so that we can start building up an FAQ so that your  questions can be more easily answered. Questions are NOT restricted to  this post, especially if those questions involve discussions! If you have posted in a previous Weekly Question Thread but your question was not answered, feel free to repost it again. 

Here are some example questions:

1. Can an iPhone 13 Pro fit in the Loewe Mini Puzzle?
2. What bag can I use in the rain under $X?
3. Does this bag match this outfit? (Can be asked in this thread or as a discussion post).
4. Has anyone had any experience shopping at <boutique> in <city>?

Examples of what NOT to post:

1. What bag are you wearing today? (This would be better as a discussion post).
2. Where was your best boutique experience? (This would be better as a discussion post).
3. Review  request for Mlouye! (There’s a chance someone who’s purchased won’t see  it as a comment and may be better off as a post for now).

1k44r95,handbags,Help me pick my dream budget crossbody bag,"Handbag newbie here, soliciting suggesting for my next crossbody bag! I have some trips coming up this summer and would love to move past my Uniqlo crescent bag. The idea is to get something nicer that I can use hands-free while traveling and also go for a night out with. I already have a Coach Brooklyn 28 that I LOVE for day-to-day things but would like a crossbody that’s more secure while traveling. 

So here’s my criteria:
- ideally under $200 (could maaaaybe push to $250 if I find something amazing, welcome to grad student life🥲)
- leather only!
- must be a crossbody (or have a convertible strap that’s leather; not a fan of fabric straps on leather bags!)
- either zip top or flap top (aka secure)
- should be able to fit a small water bottle!!! Mine measures 7cm x 22cm (roughly 2.8in x 8.8in), and should fit with my wallet, keys, phone, and AirPods. This basically means that the bag should not have any dividers or multiple compartments, since I find that larger objects just never fit in those bags!
- somewhat slouchy
- is versatile, with a nice day-to-night transition

Here’s my shortlist so far:
- The Coach Outlet Kailey: I like the fact that it’s under my budget, comes in many color ways, seems spacious, and is just a simple, classic silhouette. My water bottle will be a tight fit though! I scrolled through some other Outlet options, but I find that this is the only one that’s slightly slouchy (as compared to say the Teri)
- The Horse Clementine: the sub’s favorite child of course made it to the list. LOVE the slouch and top handle, but a little out of budget ($215 with the welcome offer). My preferred color (coffee) doesn’t come in my preferred hardware (gold), but that’s a secondary concern for me. A slightly bigger concern is that I find the crossbody strap a tad too thick, which I fear may not look very elegant if I choose to wear it on a fancy night out. Overall a little bulky I guess!
- Quince Puzzle dupe: the sub’s least favorite child also made it lol! I like its similarities to the Horse bag at a much more affordable price, but it doesn’t seem to have its slouch, and the lack of color options isn’t ideal either. 

Would love to hear your thoughts on these bags! And if you have any suggestions that fit the bill, please let me know!

Edit: I should mention that I LOVE the Coach Juliet bags, but they’re way out of my budget right now. But I’m open to scouring the second-hand market for similar items!",2025-04-21 04:09:10+00:00,7,21

1k42jjx,handbags,"ISO Clare V ""Moyen Messenger"" DUPE?","I need help finding a bag like this from Clare V! I really like the ""[Moyen Messenger](https://www.clarev.com/products/moyen-m-black-leather?_pos=31&_fid=baed80b14&_ss=c)"" bag in Black. What I like about it is the following:

1. The shape: I like that it is cresent-shaped and not too small that I can't fit anything, but also not too big as I am looking for just a casual bag to carry my wallet, sunglasses, and things needed for the day. Not work-related where it needs to fit a computer!

2. The zipper closure: I really like how the bag zips closed and is not a snap or magnet shut. It ensures that all the things inside are safe and will not spill out.

3. The shiny, bag-shape with leather shine: I really like that the bag does not look too stiff and has shape. It also is not a solid black that is matte, but also shines due to it being made from leather.

4. Finally, WEARABLE different ways!!: I really like how you can wear this bag both over the shoulder and across the body crossbody style. Sometimes I like carrying my bag over the shoulder to dinner, but crossbody when running errands. I like how this bag has both options so I would not need to switch bags. Even more, both are detachable and the brand has more straps to purchase.

Whichever recommendation made, I need one that has both a shoulder and crossbody feature!! The thing is, I can't spend $435 on this bag. That is SO expensive. Not to mention, the additional straps are over $80 EACH!!! Any recommendations you can make of a bag similar to the Clare V ""Moyen Messenger"" but on a budget? Or maybe, is the Clare V brand worth it quality-wise? I'm not that familiar with the brand, but I just can't seem to justify spending over $400 for a bag...

The others did not impress me (Radley started fraying, the sealed edge flaked off half the length of the Dooney strap, the PL showed every nick and scratch, and the Nash bamboo handles actually broke within the first week I had the bag, and it was a constant struggle to keep the cotter pins tight).

So ... it's that time of year for me to get another bag. What should I get?

Non-negotiable things I need:  
\-Crossbody  
\-Leather  
\-Something large enough to hold a coordinating continental wallet

Things I prefer:  
\-Feet on the bottom  
\-Something unique, like an independent designer (not one I can find at my local department store)  
\-Something artistic and eye-catching in the ""I would like to have that bag"" way and not the ""I would like to steal that bag"" way

I bought a LV Trio Messenger on a whim. I was browsing a pre-owned site, and the black and grey with silver hardware just called to me. Not a huge LV fan, so didn't know it was listed as a men's bag until doing research later, but it's absolutely perfect and completely unisex, so who cares? As a mom and asthmatic, the kit I haul around on a daily basis is no joke, and this bag organizes everything to be so easy to access it's criminal it took me so long of digging around in totes/satchels/backpacks to find this bag. 

The key pouch fits emergency medication to be easily accessible for fast deployment. 

The smaller front pouch holds various medications decanted to small bottles, as well as inhaler, mints, clippers, chapstick, and lip gloss. It sounds like a lot, but everything sits nicely so it's no trouble at all to put my hands on any given item I should need. 

The main pouch holds my key fob, the spare fob for Husband's car so there's no panic search for keys when his car is easier to take to an appointment and kids are running ten minutes late, wallet, Germ-X wipes, nail file, glasses cleaning cloth, pens, candy, earbuds, phone, and e-reader for long waits. 

I don't like carrying this bag, and I have no idea why. I love this bag. It's perfect. But I have had it for months and only used it for a week trip. Maybe it's the monogram pattern? They've always struck me as being rather meh before, though I have several Coach wristlets that I like and have used as carry pouches for stuff in larger bags. And no hatred to Coach, because I have a few older leather bags that are in my rotation because they are amazing. I also live and work in a nice area, so I see fancy bags in the wild almost daily and not worried about standing out with an expensive purse. There's just something about this bag!

1k3u12z,handbags,Carrying luxury bags to work: Should I just carry what I damn well please or be humble?,"Just asking the bag community here.

I used to work in a high-flyer company where everyone came to work in smart corporate suits. Ladies carried luxury designer bags both as a fashion statement and and as a symbol of power and authority.

Recently, I took a break and opted for another temporary job that was a non-corporate setting. My colleagues are often dressed in casual comfortable clothes and the setting is more relaxed.

As I am always used to dressing up for work (think: classy clothes, clean make up and luxury bags), I often go to work dressed up and carry my luxury bags. However, I have noticed stares from my new colleagues and I can read their faces as saying ""Is she crazy dressed up like that here?!""

My best friend tells me I should tone down, be humble and try to assimilate in my new workplace. She tells me to wear brandless bags that are not ostentatious. I see the image I choose as just me being true to myself. What is important is that the bag I carry does not compromise the quality of my work in the new place.

Once he stops pushing I immediately grab the python skin bag, then grab the black bucket bag for a closer look. Saw the Ralph Lauren Made in Italy metal tag inside and Immediately started shaking. The Purple Label bags retail for thousands! And this bag is in like new condition! Then I see the bucket bag still with its tags attached! Immediately go to check out before they decide to take these back because this was such an insane couple of finds. That's when I noticed the black bucket bag has no price tag. The security guard already told me he was keeping a close eye on me in case ""these bags leave the store without being paid for"" AKA me stealing. I visit 1-5 times a week so I felt like for a familiar face that was a lil much. But whatever. Went up to security and asked if I could get a price, to which he says ""I can't have you ripping off tags just because you don't like the price"". Told him I had not and he replied that the tagger in the back was absolutly sure she tagged all of them. So he heads to the back and returns a few minutes later, and of course the tagger puts a hole in the leather where the tag goes, so I told security to take a look, there are no other holes on the bag from being tagged previously. Then moved to the check out. Regardless, got my bags and am over the moon! Since these bags are real, I can't help but wonder if the Gucci and Louis Vuitton bags were real. I was able to get a very quick look at the guy holding them in check out, and the canvas looked a little off. But not enough for me to be sure. Regardless my bag collection has been missing an exotic skin, and Goodwill was the last place I was expecting to find one!

Was just wondering if anyone else who bought a Murakami collab or any LV bag online and had it shipped home, what your packaging was like? I bought the white pouchette and it had no stuffing inside the bag, just the 2 straps and the straps weren't wrapped. Just wondering if this was normal as I've never bought LV online before and was surprised they at least didn't stuff the bag inside. I know this might be nitpicky but whenever I buy bags in the store in person they always stuff them and usually the brand new ones in the back have the straps still in the packaging too.",2025-04-20 17:08:23+00:00,1,7

I just decided to get a Longchamp for Uni but now Im usure about the size.

As for now I like the Shopper M Le Pilage Original because I feel like l would be too big. 

I also like the Shopper L Le Pilage but the size just seems a bit overwhelming and I like to keep my bags as small as possible while still being able to fit everything necessary into it.

Do you guys think this model (shopper or not) and size is suitable for Uni? Im not studying Law but a major part of my classes are law classes so I tend to have to carry arround many books and some folders if I decide to study in the library.

I love these bags, but I’ve recently realized I don’t totally know how to care for them. One of my Pratezi Firenze bags is turning 10 years old this year and I’m just noticing a small amount of wear on her corners, and when she’s not full, she sort of folds in on herself… 

I have never done any sort of purse care on this bag, but online I see people restoring old bags with leather balms and things…and I’m wondering: is that something people do for their bags? Should I be conditioning these pieces with some sort of frequency?

1k36nw2,handbags,The Row Henri Bag,"These are photo of the new Henri bag from The Row. The color is Brunette. First five photos are mine, final two are the stock photos. 

Bag shape. The bag is effectively a three dimensional rectangle shape, but it’s designed such that the top rectangle surface (where the zipper is) collapses in on itself when you’re carrying it, producing more of an irregular geometric shape as a result. 

Interior. The interior is leather and seems very nice. On my Margaux 15 bag the interior is canvas, and the pocket seams show through on the exterior (hard to explain). Here that doesn’t happen, presumably due to the leather being thicker. 

Weight. I did not weigh the bag, but it definitely feels reasonably lightweight.

Strap drop. The strap drop is perfect. I’m uncomfortable posting photos of me on reddit, but it hangs off the shoulder with plenty of space under the armpit. It’s easy and smooth to put it on my shoulder one handed too. The strap are flat and stay on my shoulder well. Of course YMMV depending on your body build.  

Cost. It’s pricy. I have been looking for a shoulder bag with a zipper and was considering the large Miu Miu Beau bag originally. I haven’t tried that one on yet, but the price was comparable. 

Structure. It’s pretty slouchy. I am stuffing it for now, but I’ll look for a bag insert to use when I’m storing it because I want to avoid excessive creases on the bottom corners.

Price: very reasonable, especially for the quality. I don’t remember exactly but believe it was around $500CAD so a little less USD. Jeff is very upfront about the pricing and the options. Half is paid up front and half once it’s completed.

Process: great! I got a say in all aspects and was able to make modifications to fit my taste. He is very communicative, gives great updates, and provides pictures of every stage of the process.

Quality: excellent!! The construction is great, the lining is beautiful, and the leather beautiful. The stitching is perfect. I never noticed stitching before but after seeing all the posts on here with poor stitching I’ve begun to notice it more.

1k2z63d,handbags,"Should I Sell My Luxury Handbags Now That the ""Illusion"" is Gone?","Hey everyone-I've recently gone down a rabbit hole after seeing some of the new Chinese manufacturers openly replicating high-end luxury bags to near perfection—and exposing just how insane the markups are from the original brands. We're talking about bags that cost $200 to make being sold for $3,000+. It kind of shattered the illusion for me.

Now I’m looking at my own luxury bag collection a little differently. I used to see them as investments or timeless pieces, but now I’m wondering if I should sell them while they still hold value in the resale market—before more people catch on to what’s really happening.

I’m torn because I do still love some of the designs and there’s a sentimental attachment to a few. But knowing what I know now, they just don't feel as “special,” you know?

Has anyone else felt this shift? Would you sell? Hold? Or just ignore all of it and keep enjoying the bags?

Would love to hear your thoughts or personal experiences!

PS- please be kind",2025-04-19 15:42:50+00:00,0,103

1k2yaxm,handbags,Cardholder dilemma …,"So I’m kinda wondering if it’s just me? Or is luxury cardholder quality diminishing as a whole?

I had an LV Epi for years. It was hard leather, durable, looked great for over 5 years (before they discontinued it. Ugh). Moved on to a YSL which started splitting and fraying on the corners after maybe a year. Went back to LV, but wasn’t a fan of the softer new leather and how deeply my credit cards fall into the slots, so I ended up reselling that and buying a Goyard (which I liked aside from how hard it is to actually get the cards out of) which I’ve now had for over 2 years and is starting to show some wear. I’m looking into getting another and I’m completely lost on what luxury brands use harder, tougher leather.

I know metal credit cards and constant usage play major factors in durability, but I’m looking for some help on recommendations here (FYI, I’m a guy, so probably something more masculine). Any help would be great. Thanks!",2025-04-19 15:05:10+00:00,3,9

When I got home, I carefully used this leather care kit from Guardsman for our leather sofa that the people at Room and Board recommended. Specifically, I used the ink remover wipes that come in the kit.

I carefully dabbed the ink off with the wipes and it’s gone!!!!

I don’t think it would work with, say, a Coach bag from their legacy line (the one that’s minimally finished glove tanned leather), but I think for most handbags that have that slightly acrylic or almost plasticy dye to it (yes my Gucci bag is real), I think this would work.

1k2i8gn,handbags,On the recent “luxury brands exposed!!” discourse,"Wrote a whole rant about this yesterday and got flagged and removed, mods pls i’m not promoting any funny business. Just want to share my thoughts with people who get it💔💔 Is anyone else just disappointed in the lack of critical thinking of consumers? I’ve been seeing so many posts saying that all luxury goods are a scam because a random man on the internet claimed so. Yes there is a mark up on luxury items and quality in recent years has gone down for many brands, but there is still a reason they’re expensive. As someone who really only buys vintage bags, part of what’s so nice about them is the fact that they have history. I love having bags that are unique, good quality, and have a story behind them!! I was never a bag person until I started working in the industry, i liked vintage fashion in general but I hadn’t spent a lot of time around accessories. After seeing thousands of items from various brands, it’s impossible to not see, feel, & even smell the difference between a Birkin and a bag from tiktok shop 😭 I’ve only recently reached a point where I can occasionally splurge, and all but 1 one of my bags costed less than $600. That amount of money is still objectively a lot for most people including me lol, but I feel like they are all worth what I paid. My oldest is from 2000, it’s a delicate textile (calf hair,) and it still looks beautiful!! I know the average consumer who isn’t into handbags doesn’t know all of the intricacies behind them, but I wish people would actually do research and form their own beliefs instead of blindly believing random people. Instead of buying something because people on the internet, who have probably never touched a birkin (I never had until working around them!) are claiming it’s the same quality & magically 5% of the price. I’m not angry at the individuals who are believing the tiktok randos, i’m annoyed that fast fashion has trained everyone’s brain to believe that everything should be cheap. Certain things are expensive for a reason!! Most people can’t afford a to spend 10k (not including pre spend lol) on a birkin or a chanel flap, i can’t, and I’m fine not owning them. Buy from smaller brands, artisans, thrift stores, ebay etc etc the list goes on!!! I love my lil collection of both luxury and non luxury bags because I chose them, not anyone else. I just get sad thinking about how corporations have successfully tricked a large chunk of the population to accept whatever we’re given. I’m not boot licking the CEOs who run luxury companies, and I’m well aware a lot of their practices are just as bad as fast fashion brands. But i feel like we’ve reached a point where people are so content buying items made of literal plastic because they’re cheap that they don’t question the ethics of HOW they’re so cheap at all. I want people in the future to be able to be excited to find a vintage 2025 purse that has lasted because it was well made. At the rate we’re going everything is going to end up in a landfill bc it fell apart after 10 wears 😭😭",2025-04-18 23:05:19+00:00,81,105

1k2hp99,handbags,I found the cutest vintage YSL for $50!!,"Okay guys, it's finally my turn for an amazing deal! 
I don't know if you remember a few weeks ago maybe a month, someone had posted in this group that they were gifted a bunch of bags when their mom was doing a closet clean out. There was a super cute vintage gold YSL in that list of bags and I've been looking for it online ever since. Everywhere I look it's $1,300 to $2100 on resale sites. I like it, but not that much. 

I randomly decided to do a reverse image search last week and I just stumbled upon it on Poshmark for $50. The listing didn't say YSL in it, it just said ""Classy clutch for an unforgettable night."" I thought it had to be too good to be true, but I was willing to take the risk so I scooped it up really quickly and paid a total of $67 for this cute bag! 

About the bag From Chat GPT: 
""This vintage Yves Saint Laurent minaudière is a striking example of how luxury branding and promotional marketing intersected in the late 1970s and 1980s. While it looks like a high-end evening bag — with its structured cylindrical shape, gold metallic finish, and signature YSL Cassandre logo — it was originally offered as a gift with purchase for YSL’s iconic Opium fragrance.

These minaudières were typically included with deluxe fragrance sets during special promotional campaigns, often at upscale department stores. Designed to reflect the opulence and exotic branding of the Opium line, the bag features a twisted black-and-gold cord strap and dramatic black tassels, giving it a distinctively theatrical and luxurious feel. Though never sold at retail, it has since become a collectible item for vintage fashion enthusiasts and YSL collectors alike.""

When it arrived today I was so excited! It's in great shape for being almost 50 years old. I'm going to keep it and pass it down to my daughter! 🎉🎉

1k2dstf,handbags,Help me decide if Loewe Hobo Hammock is for me,"Hi, I have been reading this sub for the longest time but this is my first post. I love the good vibes in posts here and I look forward to your wise advice. 

I have loved bags all my life, since I was a child. I own a few mid-level brands but I have never spent more that £300 for a bag. I have a huge crush on Loewe. Despite my undying love for the Puzzle, it doesn’t look great on my frame for regular use, and it would be too expensive to buy it and not wear it every day. I do like many of their other models too and often check for Flamenco or Hammock preloved. I came across this lovely hobo hammock on Vinted and I am very tempted to buy it. Brand new, gorgeous colour for me. Proof of purchase from Bicester village, an outlet in the UK. I haven’t tried the hobo version, but from the style online I think it might work for my body. I am 160cm and 54 kg.

If you have the bag, how do you rate it? Do you use it every day? Would it work for someone with a relatively short body?

I'm looking at the flamenco clutch bag (specifically as I do not like the style of the purse) for a versatile day to night bag but I'm not sure on the sizes. I would only be carrying my phone, a small cardholder, car key, two epipens, and a couple of lipsticks. The mini seems like a good fit but the medium looks a lot more comfortable to hold as a clutch due to the size. Does anyone use either size as a clutch for more formal/evening occasions?

There is no Loewe store near me so I cannot see them in person unfortunately so any help is much appreciated :). ",2025-04-18 19:19:58+00:00,2,3

1k2ctoh,handbags,"Cult Gaia Keeps Delaying my Order, and it might not get to me on time.","Hi, I'm not sure if I can do anything about it, but I was wondering if anyone ever experienced this situation. On February, I ordered the Florence Clutch from Cult Gaia. At that time, the website said that it was available, and was ready to be shipped (not in pre-order like it has been for the last weeks). About 2 days after ordering the bag, I noticed that they changed their website option from ""order"" to ""pre-order."" A day later I received an email saying that unfortunately they will not ship my bag until a week from that day, since they ran out of stock, but that they will ship it sometime next week. Next week, I saw that they increased its price (about $100)on the website. Next week(when it was supposed to be shipped) I got a now very generic email saying that they were delaying the shipment and now they won't ship it until a 2 week window meaning that the now earliest time that I'll receive it would be the second week of March. About a week after they sent another email pushing the shipping window a week further. So far, I have received 4 emails and now it says that the window will be between April 19 and may 2. My problem is that I ordered this for my wedding (that will be at the end of May). Judging by how badly they're handling this, I am unsure if I'll get it on time for it. I emailed them with my concerns explaining my situation, and they answered me saying that they don't know when they'll ship it. This is frustrating, especially because I bought it before they made it a pre-order item (when was available), and I don't know what to do about it.",2025-04-18 19:03:38+00:00,2,3

1k2ai88,handbags,Should I keep or return? Gucci Ophidi shoulder bag in white,"I bought this on a whim 2 weeks ago in Taipei at one of the Gucci stores. I though what a great every day carry - it’s the perfect size for me and I love the colors (I’m drawn to lighter, white tones - I also love the Diana shoulder bag in white with the bamboo handles). It was a splurge and something I never do but I love the shape and size and colors of it. It just drew me in. 

I knew nothing of designer bags (still don’t) but now that I’m home and have been living on this subreddit I am rethinking the purchase. I don’t even know if I can return it now that I’m in the states but I’m concerned that 1) it’ll get so dirty. I’ve been googling color guards (but with a bag that’s mixed cavas and leather I don’t even know what I can spray?) and only wearing it with light clothes (of which I have none - I tend to go for darks/neutrals). I read jeans (which I wear daily for work) can rub off. Plus I travel 2 weeks a month and can’t imagine sliding it under the seat on the dirty airplane floor or putting it through the gross security belts. 2) as mentioned above I wear a lot of neutrals (blue jeans or dark pants with beige white blue black tops usually) so really shouldn’t I have picked a brighter bag as more of a statement or focal piece (I love the pink Gucci tote, love white, orange, purple, green bags in general)? I tend to just not gravitate towards black bags but I’m just not sure what to do to protect my bag or what else I should get to be my daily bag. It’s a lot of money for me so my collection will always be more limited and it’s not something I will be ok with saying “let it get dirty” as I’m very much a frugal, thrifty person who never spends big money on things.

1k24d2e,handbags,Vestirsi not converting AUD to USD.,"Decided to purchase these 2 bags yesterday. 
The amount came out to 558 AUD.


When I went to check out via PayPal, the amount was 558 USD. The exchange rate was not applied. 


I emailed them asking why it didn't give me the correct price in USD but I haven't heard back (yet).


Is this normal? Companies charging the same number in all currencies? I mean I'd be overpaying by 200 which for this amount, isn't worth it

1k23t8i,handbags,Help me find a brand?!?!,"Okay handbag babes, I need some help. 

A couple weeks ago, my mom and I were browsing at Centre Commercial Beaugrenelle in Paris. We saw this small section in the accessories department, that had a brand we weren’t familiar with. 

There were about five or so featured styles, most were sparkly, and some of them had polka dots. I recall silver sparkly polka dots on a few bags; some bags were cream-ish color; some gold glitter; perhaps the material was some kind of canvas? 

I could be completely wrong, but thought maybe the brand name was “something & something”. 

We didn’t spend much time on them, but once we got back, she wished she could share the name with some of her friends who would like them. 

If you have any leads, I’m so open! And so grateful haha

REVIEW: Overall it was fun, but not totally sure it’s worth the price tag. The tutorials are also all in Chinese and the captions aren’t easy to follow at times. The measurements for thread were also mistranslated at some points, leading to some mistakes while sewing due to a thread being too short. Definitely some mistakes here and there (had to rip off half the base of the bag due to sewing half the piping inside out - only cried for like an hour after thinking I ruined my bag lol) but overall I think it looks alright! Definitely don’t think it will last forever (not convinced it’s real leather) but it should hold up for a bit!

I'm looking for a small, luxury used crossbody type bag to take to baseball games (my stadium allows them smaller than 9x5 and I'm not against taking designer there), quick outings, etc. Mainly to hold my phone, ID, cards, and my key fob. 

I'm wanting to buy used due to the nature of what I'm using it for. I have an LV Graceful so I'm partial to Louis but I'm having trouble finding any used in somewhat decent condition. Doesn't have to be perfect by any stretch, but I also don't want it falling apart at the seams. 

Any comparable designers that have small bags that fit this criteria? I'm looking to spend $800 max but less would be great. Any specific websites/sellers you recommend?

I've seen lots that fit this search on Fashionphile but I'm not sure exactly what to look for and would love personal opinions as it is tough to gauge the size.

1. Léo et Violette – Le Nova in Embossed Cocoa
I think the color is divine—such a rich brown and super versatile for fall/winter. The design feels sleek and minimal but still elegant.

2. Fleuron – Medium Swann in Bleu Caraibes
This one’s a pop of color that just makes me happy! The Bleu Caraibes shade reminds me of my honeymoon in Turks & Caicos, so there’s a bit of emotional connection here too. It has such a beautiful, sculptural shape.

I know they’re very different in style and color, but I genuinely love both in their own way.

	•	Quality and craftsmanship
	•	Durability over time
	•	Scratch-resistance (especially for the embossed leather)

1k1tq6l,handbags,Has anyone gotten their hands on the Ralph Shoulder Bag?,"Ralph Lauren’s Spring 2025 collection included this beautiful, understated shoulder bag. I saw it on a few celebrities who attended the Ralph Lauren Pre-Fall show and became curious. Its slouchy yet structured silhouette reminds me a bit of the Row Margaux and Toteme T-Lock.

It appears that there are two sizes and two colors. Both sizes come with only a top handle, but the top handle for the larger size appears shorter.

I couldn’t find any bloggers, YouTubers, or tiktokers who have gotten their hands on this bag. I’m curious whether both sizes are 
true shoulder bags or whether the larger size cannot be worn on the shoulder due to the shorter strap.

If anyone has more photos or experience with this bag, I’d love to know!

Gail made a living making huge furniture. Think dining tables and large benches. She was a petite and older. You wouldn’t think she’d be able to do that. She also dressed simply: plaid shirts, cargo khaki pants. Wore plain glasses.

When I finally got the bag, I started remembering Gail and one of the assignments I had and the conversation I had with her. We had to make a wooden shoebox and bring a pair of shoes that were meaningful to us. I brought in a pair of designer sandals that had a blue velvet tie and orange leather. She loved those sandals. 

I don’t have the shoes anymore. All I have is that box, and my memories of her. 

She believed in things being well crafted. She saw the beauty in those designer shoes and saw the craft behind them. She seemed stern, but she’d smile when you nailed a lesson she had just taught.

je suis tombé sur ce poste Facebook disant :

""Ma mère a été licenciée de chez Polène après 7 ans de travail à cause de problèmes de santé, sans aucune indemnité ! J’ai donc décidé de partager une information confidentielle que seuls les employés et leurs proches connaissent. Avec le lancement de leur nouvelle collection de sacs, Polène a discrètement ouvert une section sur leur site où l’on peut obtenir un sac Polène Numéro Un presque gratuitement, juste en répondant à quelques questions. C’est leur façon de vider les stocks sans faire de bruit d’ici la fin du mois. Je laisserai le lien dans les commentaires. Passez le court questionnaire et recevez un sac tout neuf ! Parlez-en à toutes vos amies, qu’elles ne tardent pas. Peut-être que ce n’est pas très juste envers l’entreprise, mais que feriez-vous si c’était votre mère?""

Last week I asked for advice on which Dooney & Bourke satchel to purchase during their sale. I ultimately decided on the pink because it looked like a really nice, cool-toned shade that would have gone with a lot of my wardrobe. 

Got it today and the color is SO different in person. I’m returning it because I don’t like it at all. I was really looking forward to this purchase so I’m very disappointed.

I’m looking to buy about 10-15 of the Trader Joe’s canvas bags for work. Looking for just the manufacturer of the bags so I can buy them without a logo. The feel, durability, and sturdiness of the bags are exactly what I’m looking for. 

I’m constantly bringing lots of materials to client meetings (think 4-5 bags) and right now the bags I have are not it. They are random store bags that are falling apart.

1k1j8hg,handbags,"Ran a marathon, got myself some treats!","I ran the Schneider Electric Paris Marathon on Sunday and always like to reward myself. 

I stopped at the LV store in Nice to get the navy pochette métis. My SA was amazing and the store experience was really fun. She gave me a little history of the store (that it was the oldest LV store continuously operating in the same location) and mentioned that navy is a harder to find colour. I later picked up a matching wallet and scarf at the store in Paris. 

On to 19 Cambon for the Chanel experience! On the first day I went, I had almost settled on the flap bag with top handle in a purple but couldn’t make a decision. I returned the next day to a new SA and now I fully understand “clicking with the right SA”. I kept mentioning I don’t like traditional colours and she said “I think I have just the right one for you!” and came out with the pink. What really sold it for me though was the detailing of the letters on the top of the flap. My husband and I celebrated with a glass of champagne and then the SA packaged everything for me for a safe trip home. She mentioned that the Cambon store is the only store in the world where purchases are boxed in white and bagged in a white bag because it’s the original store. 

Over all, I had a really great time and glad I have some souvenirs to memorialize an incredible trip. ",2025-04-17 17:56:55+00:00,206,27

1k1it40,handbags,Bought a luxury bag for my sister — here’s what I learned (and would do differently next time),"I recently bought a bag for my older sister — something classic, something that would hold up well, and hopefully feel special every time she wears it.

I went back and forth between a Chanel Classic Flap, a Celine Box, and a Lady Dior. After weeks of stalking reviews and resale forums (and lowkey texting some people who shop way more than I do), I ended up choosing the Chanel in caviar leather — and honestly, I think I got it right.

Here’s what I factored in:
	•	She’s not the type to baby a bag, so lambskin was out.
	•	Wanted something that holds value, in case she ever wants to trade or resell.
	•	Something that fits her “grown and elegant” vibe but isn’t screaming logos.

I’ve since been helping a couple friends figure out their own “forever bag” situations — happy to share notes if anyone is choosing between a few styles. Also curious:

What would YOU pick if you were gifting a bag to someone you love — and why?

1k12lhx,handbags,Is a Longchamp Le Pliage a Good Choice for Work in Sweden?,"Hi everyone!

I’m preparing for my move to Sweden and looking for a practical yet stylish bag for work. I came across the Longchamp Le Pliage collection and am considering getting one, but I wanted to ask for your thoughts first. Specifically:
1. Will a Longchamp Le Pliage work well in a professional setting in Sweden? Or too casual? I’m aiming for something durable, as the weather can be pretty harsh in Sweden (cold, wet winters).
2. Is it worth the investment for work, or would you recommend something else for practicality and professional style?

I’d love to hear your thoughts and any recommendations for similar bags that are suitable for work life in Sweden!

1k11uml,handbags,Skap ?,"Alright handbag friends, please bear with me… I’m back with what I believe may be another luxury handbag found while thrifting. I lucked upon this adorable solid mesh & leather bag yesterday for $19.99 “as is”, and I’m a little infatuated, haha. It’s truly a work of art, having branded high quality hardware and an embossed serial number. The attention to detail in its design is super impressive. Every stitch is perfect and the leather rivals my Loewe find in buttery softness. The trouble is, it’s impossible to find much information via Google. 

I recognize it’s a total shot in the dark but I’m hopeful someone may remember the brand “Skap”? Skap Le France? Google brings up a website of a high end luxury Chinese fashion label, focusing mainly on shoes? That’s about as far as I got in my search! 
The bag itself came with a partial chain that’s missing an end that I assume clipped to *extra* secure that tongue down. That and a tiny spot on each handle with missing finish are the only flaws I’ve found. I removed the chain and added screw on U rings I already had on hand without needing to alter it at all. Now I can utilize her as a crossbody!

I’m super happy with it regardless, I love everything about it and appreciate the quality and I love that it’s unique!! Cheers to anyone that may have any insight and if you’ve read this far, and may the thrift gods ever continue to bless the community. 🫶",2025-04-17 02:09:23+00:00,1,1

1k0tbro,handbags,Will I regret selling my speedy 25 bandoulliere in canvas?,"Hi All,

I am planning on selling my louis vuitton speedy 25 in canvas. It was my first designer bag and I think what really pushed me to get it is how classic and timeless it is. Since then I have bought other designer bags (Chanel, Dior, Delvaux) and found that I naturally gravitate towards bags that are more understated. They also seem to go better with my day to day style which leans more classic-elegant. I also found that wearing the speedy gives me the most ""discomfort"". Not due to its shape or easy of use but because of the attention it gets me. It is such an iconic bag and the canvas is so eye-catching I notice I get the most stares/looks when I go out with that bag. As an introvert who loves nice things, I still like being rather ""invisible"" with my designer items in public. None of my other bags will draw this much attention when I carry them which makes them a lot more comfortable from a feelings perspective when using them. These were the main reasons that pushed me to list the speedy canvas for sale but now that I have some serious buyers, I am started to get fear of future regret. I still think it is a gorgeous bag and can easily elevate any outfit. However, it doesn't feel quite ""me"". As someone who does enjoy fashion though, will I miss it later down the road and wish I had one of the most iconic designer bags that was ever made? Will I see others wear it and wish I had it again? Or is it better to sell it given I haven't worn it much in the last year due to the discomfort I feel from the attention it grabs? Anyone experience this and can share thoughts/experiences even with other bags that they sold because they felt it was not their style but later regretted it?",2025-04-16 19:37:09+00:00,1,6

There are still stains that are just not going to come out without risking ruining the fabric or putting a hole in it. But it is significantly better, and I think it is good enough that someone will be OK using it again. What I used: dunked the bag and soaked it in room temperature water with a little bit of dawn soap. Used a soft horse hairbrush to begin cleaning, and it became obvious it was going to need direct soap. I first tried Donn on the brush and scrubbing, and then changed to Shout stain cleaner. I rinse the bag in the same water and then sprayed aerosol hairspray directly on the ink stains on the cloth lining. I rubbed the fabric against itself, and all of the stains came out. I rinsed it twice in freshwater to make sure I got all of the soap residue out. Stuffed it with microfiber shop Claus and let it dry in the sun. I will probably spray it with scotch guard to protect it from further staining.",2025-04-16 16:32:27+00:00,7,3

1k0no9k,handbags,Help me find a designer tote!,"Hey all! So i'm on the lookout for a nice large tote back. Doesn't have to be huge but i need it to fit a 10-inch ipad so it can also be my fancy travel bag. My dream bag is a travertine Bottega but I can't afford it even on the second-hand market :(  like this kind of color because i think it can work for both summer and winter. But since my options are limited due to price, I'm also ok with any neutral color or black.

I don't like mid-range designers so I'll probably will end up buying something second hand. I like Prada, Gucci, Chanel (some of their old shopping bags are in my price range), YSL, Fendi and such.

I've been thinking about either a Chanel shopping bag (pic below) or a YSL medium Loulou recently. Do you think the puffer Loulou is wintery and won't look good with summer outfits? Given i don't have crazy money to spend on bags every month, I'm trying to build a bag portfolio of timeless pieces instead of trendy ones. I also love the idea of passing these on to my daughter when she's older and wiser. And OK I know those have nothing to do with a Bottega but they're totes. Does anyone have any other ideas for me? Bonus point if it's easy to find on the second hand market. I'm looking to spend around $1.7k-$1.8k on this purchase.

Thank you!

1k0kzwg,handbags,Which top handle bag should I go for?,"Hi all, I'm in the market for a top handle boxy bag. I'm currently stuck between these two lovely things:

Aspinal of London Midi Mayfair 2 

* Pros: priced well, excellent quality (having tried it on in London when I went there last summer), more casual so I may get more wear out of it.
* Cons: I also want this bag to serve as an occasional fancy event bag and it might be too casual for that; no back slip pocket. Locking mechanism is not as cool. 

YSL Mini Cassandra

* Pros: sleek and polished looking, super cool locking mechanism, back pocket, can be dressed up or down easily. The YSL logo looks quite classy.
* Cons: priced much higher; have not tried it so unsure about the feel and durability. May be a bit too fancy for most of my everyday outfits so I'm worried about cost-per-wear.

They are otherwise very similar bags and will fill a hole in my modest collection. Financially I can afford both easily. 

As a side note, I really wish the Mayfair came in more pebbled or caviar leather options. The patent croc and lizard leathers are just not my vibe.

I bought a red Coach gallery tote (leather), thinking it would be great for travel, but now I’m concerned. I think the leather is thick enough to not be successfully cut, it’s a zip top. Is it too flashy? Is a tote a bad idea? When traveling, I also have my hand on my tote while on my shoulder and I keep it close. But it seems many people think crossbody bags are best. Others I have considered bringing:

Rothy’s crossbody - holds a surprising amount, lightweight, zip top, but worry it could be cut. 
Dooney and Bourke leather crossbody - leather, sturdy. It’s not my favorite bag but it’s hearty. 
Le Pliage tote - love this one, traveled UK with it but its nylon so worry about it being cut. 
Portland leather triangle shoulder bag - plain looking, thick leather, holds a good amount.

The first bag is the Mini Sling from Bellroy. I have been using it almost everyday since I got pregnant four years ago. It is lightweight, has enough space to fit two sets of keys, two phones and has a sunglass zipped pouch. I find myself reaching for it when I go to walk our dog, a quick trip to the shop, pick kids up from daycare etc. You get the picture. 

  
However now kids are bit older I really like to use a bag that is a bit cooler, more feminine and more put together than Bellroy and still practical, ideally crossbody so it frees up my hands. 

I have a few small bags and these one are what I narrowed down as casual bags, but they just don't work for me. 

MJ Camera - too heavy, not enough space, difficult to get things out.

Balenciaga City Mini - bought too long ago, don't feel it is my style any more.

Rylan small Satchel - love the design but so difficult to open open the buckle.

I need your expertise. I'm totally lost.

I want to buy a luxury/high end bag, my budget is around 5000€/5600$ (more or less) for one or several bags. I don't know if it's enough you tell me.

My criterias are :

A practical bag with at least one pocket. 
I'd like a medium/large size that I can actually put stuff into and since I'm chubby it wouldn't look weird or out of space.

A shoulder bag, cross body would be the best, I'm 176cm/5'9 so the strap has to be long enough. 

For the colour something I could wear anytime I feel like it, so if its summer or winter it wouldn't matter. 
Flashy, eye catching pattern aren't my style. 
I don't really like logo patterns but if it's done with taste I don't mind.


I'm not sure about the terminology since English isn't my first language. So don't hesitate to ask me questions if I wasn't clear.",2025-04-15 20:19:12+00:00,1,5

1jzubz5,handbags,What is going on???  3 damaged wallets in a row!,"For the last couple months, I've been on the hunt for a high-end small wallet/cardholder as a reward to myself for a significant raise at work.  Unfortunately, I don't live near any luxury boutiques, so have been ordering online.  First, I ordered a My Dior Glycine wallet, but one side of the flap was sticking up, so back it went.  I then ordered a Dior Jolie Glycine wallet (really love the quilted look as well as the layout with 1 zip pocket and 1 pocket for cards).  This time, the flap closed at an angle.  As in, when closed, one side of the flap was higher than the other.  So, returned this one, too.  (I didn't take pictures of these, but the defects were obvious.  I tried to tell myself they were fine, but knew it would bug me).

Next, I tried ordering Chanel, as I was pretty sure they would have a similar type wallet, but was informed by customer service that I could neither buy a wallet online nor over the phone.  The only option to buy a wallet was in person, and if I don't live near a boutique, then too bad.

Still determied to find my wallet, I then found the Gucci wallet in the photos - and totally fell for the color.  Was so excited when it arrived yesterday, but when I unboxed it, I was literally shaking I was so taken aback by its condition.  (It actually looks quite a bit worse in person than my pictures reflect).  Obviously, it's being returned, as well.

So, what in the actual hell is going on here?  I'm trying my absolute hardest to spend a ridiculous amount of money on a wallet, and I either get items that are glaringly defective or am refused the chance to buy one at all.  Does anyone have any suggestions for another brand with more consistent quality that I could try?  My experience has to be an aberration, right?  An unfortunate string of bad luck.  Surely, this can't be what passes for normal at this price range?  (Maybe I'm just really out of touch, but this seems like *a lot* of money to me for a wallet).  Anyway, I really just want to treat myself to a wallet that will make my heart sing, if possible. Thank you!",2025-04-15 15:11:04+00:00,132,75

1jzpwo8,handbags,New to the handbag game,"Longtime lurker, first time purchaser and poster! Sorry for the essay but I’m so excited to share and I don’t think anyone in my life appreciates bags as much as I do and would judge my decisions. 

3 years ago I graduated and qualified into a lucrative profession with a decent amount of debt. I really wanted to buy myself something nice at the time, a designer wallet was top of my list, but I’ve always been VERY frugal and could never justify the price.

I was given a Longchamp Le Pilage large tote for my 21st birthday which I’ve loved to death, and my mother in law gave me a gorgeous coach black wallet/clutch and multi-coloured crossbody which have both received ALOT of use, but I’ve never bought myself anything more than a few hundred AUD.

I’ve paid of my student debt and my financial position is stable. My husband has spent the last 6 months encouraging me to buy myself something and I dived head first into this subreddit to figure out what I wanted. 

A few weeks ago I went to Longchamp and tried on the Le Pilage Extra XS in nude and found it WAY roomier than expected, and thought it would be perfect for my upcoming travels. So I bit the bullet and bought it! It then came with me to Seoul where I decided to do a bit of window shopping. I was aiming to go to Gugus and look at second hand items to see what I could find - ideally the Celine Triomphe and if I was REALLY lucky, a Loewe puzzle small in tan. 

On the way to Gugus we stopped at the Hyundai department store and before I knew it I was at Celine buying the Triomphe in blush!!! Riding the high I went to Loewe and just asked to look at a puzzle, and the lovely SA said they had ONE featherweight and it just so happened to be small in tan with gold hardware… my ideal bag!

My husband spent about 20 minutes convincing me to buy it and I’m so glad he did. It was ALOOTTT OF MONEY but it’s BEAUTIFUL!!! The leather is gorgeous, the craftsmanship is insane and it’s so roomy but light as well, it’s got gorgeous slouch. I’m SOOOO in love! 

I sure I’ll change my mind in a few months, but for the moment I’ve found my purse peace and just going to sit and admire my beautiful new loves. Thank you all for sharing your bags and inspiring me!

1jzhph5,handbags,Seoul bag haul: Marge Sherwood & Couronne,"Went a little overboard with my shopping in Seoul but I have no regrets! (Swipe to see the bags dressed up with charms and the front/back of the Couronne bag)

I am easily influenced by all the TikTok girlies and was determined to visit Marge Sherwood…and ended up going two days in a row! I’m not a big fan of their crinkle or smooth leather but I do like the look and feel of their suede and nubuck bags. The first day I was torn between the Soft Boston in indigo nubuck and the Soft Baguette in light blue suede. Spoiler alert: ended up getting both 😅 

The next day my friend wanted to go back to get another bag and I couldn’t stop looking at this adorable little green purse (the Soft Bowling Bag in forest green). It was cheaper in Seoul than it would be to buy on WConcept in the states so I girlmathed and decided to also get it! Plus it comes with the matching charm! 

Three bags was supposed to be my limit for this trip but on my way to my gate at Incheon Airport I spotted a Couronne display at one of the duty free shops and fell in love with this black purse with gold hardware…took me all of 5 minutes to decide to get it! It comes with a crossbody strap but I think I’ll likely just carry it. I love both sides (the back reminds me of the Ferragamo Hug which I adore!). All of the bags they had on display were gorgeous and I wish I’d had more time (and luggage space) to shop this brand. 

This is my first time purchasing Korean handbags but I definitely want more in the future! I visited Osoi but the styles were too trendy/Y2K for my preference. I was planning on shopping at Vunque but didn’t get the chance to visit…next time I guess! If you’re visiting Korea, don’t sleep on the bag shopping! 

Price comparison (I also got an additional tax refund on the Marge Sherwood bags!): 

Soft Boston: 398000 won, ~$279 ($383 on US website)

Soft Baguette: 298000 won, ~$209 ($287 on US website)

1jzbvds,handbags,Meet Alice le Sac – Valet de Pique,"A month or two ago, a French member of the sub posted a wonderful overview of mid-range French handbag makers. I think I clicked on every link, and I absolutely fell in love with the silhouette of Alice the Handbag. (Alice le Sac). The company is Valet de Pique, based in Biarritz, where they also make their bags. 

I had some buyer’s remorse almost immediately after placing the order—there are so many bags that I want right now, and I’m not sure Alice is the most practical. (I also broke my “no smooth leather“ rule, and I worry that she will scratch easily.)

That said, it was still really fun to find a new-to-me handbag maker, and I do really like the shape. 🤎

I recently bought this Michael Michael Kors bag and it looks even better in person. It ticks all the boxes. Beautiful leather, the color goes with everything and its structured. 

The only cons is that the kindle paperwhite sticks out 1-2cm and i cant zip the bag close if i want to carry it with me. 

For that reason i started looking for similar bags that were slightly taller but i cant find any.

Is it worth keeping? Anyone who owns it can tell me if the leather holds up, keeps it shape? 

Any recommendation/ alternative to this model that would fit better the kindle?

Although I can admire a beautiful structured bag like a Strathberry, that is really not my everyday style.

1jz7ik8,handbags,My mum’s stolen bag was sold on Fashionphile,"Buckle up, friends.

Preface: we are not in the USA.

About two years ago, my mum’s gorgeous alligator Kelly 32 was stolen. We know exactly who did it (can’t share too much since it’s an active case), but let’s just say there’s zero doubt.

This guy had the audacity to list it on Facebook first. Yes, really. Then he moved to eBay. Both listings disappeared, maybe it sold, maybe he realized he needed to go the “luxury reseller” route.

Fast forward to now: we just found the exact bag listed (and sadly, already sold) on Fashionphile.

We’re currently trying to contact them with proof that it was stolen and info about the person who listed it.

- Does anyone have experience with something like this?

- Can Fashionphile be held accountable for selling a stolen bag?

- Would the buyer have to go after them if the bag gets seized as evidence?

The trial is ongoing where we live, and a police report has been filed in the USA also.

1jz6mk1,handbags,First designer bag purchase. On the fence.,"Hi. I wanted to get something from a luxury brand for a while. I work with patients and always notice the cute bags some of them have, and wanted one for myself. The thing is, I'm not rich but I earn way above avarage at my place and since finishing my studies could actually afford it. Yet, I could not find the time to actually go and pick something in store. 

The last few months was very hard for me. I have a fussy newborn, had to move close to my parents and raise my baby almost alone due to my husband being weak from an acute illness and chemotherapy. I go to work 2 times a week during my maternity leave just to escape the life I have at the moment. So, I definitely did not have the time to go and choose a bag.

I bought the YSL Toy LouLou online. Have no idea how it actually looks IRL. Never even seen YSL bags in the wild, but that's why I got YSL, LV feels kinda cheap with every second 19 year old at my place having a super copy, and YSL is recognizable enough IMO.

Now I feel like I may regret getting it. I'm 25, slim, and avarage highet. I luke wearing crop tops, mini skirts, tight dresses and jeans. Wear minimal makeup- usually just some bronzer and eyeliner. I'm afraid of looking goofy with this bag. I wanted something similar to the Cassandre (which I also only seen online),, yet good for everyday use, that doesn't scream poor taste and shows that I'm getting paid enough to afford such bag on a whim (which is huge for me since till the age of ~23 I used to ""steal"" toilet paper rolls from uni and other similar shenanigans due to being dirt poor).

I was surprised but ultimately walked away with a new Ella bag after seeing and feeling both bags. I would be happy with the nano Mosaic if it was on sale (which some styles currently are!). 

Main quality differences in my opinion:

-Leather is much softer on the Ella
-Interior is roomier in the Ella with three separate compartments 
-Crossbody strap is thoughtfully designed on the Ella 
-The crossbody strap itself is more substantial on the Ella- the thin strap on the Mosaic really bothered me
-Ease of use- the Ella is very easy to get in and out of, while the Mosaic bag is blocked by the handle

Day. She told me she would submit a request to have it taken off hold but it would take a day. This seemed fishy. 

I initiated a text chat with their customer service. Another representative told me that the item had been purchased, but that the person's bank transaction hadn't gone through. So they are giving it a whole day for the person to make payment.

Has anyone had issues like these? This happened to me last week as well. When I was trying to purchase a lovely little Ferragamo. It sat on hold all day, then finally in the evening showed as being sold. 

It's kind of infuriating. I shop on rebag and fashionfile as well, and I've never had this issue with either of those retailers.",2025-04-14 16:56:45+00:00,0,9

LVMH reported Q1 sales dipped 2 percent overall to 20.31 billion euros, (with a 4% decline in fashion/leather goods division) trumpeting its resilience ""despite a disrupted geopolitical and economic environment.""

The numbers seemed to confirm investor concern that America – which had been driving luxury consumption in recent quarters – is slowing down.
Richemont is expected on May 16.

LVMH is the first big European luxury player to report first-quarter results, with Hermès International scheduled for Thursday and Kering, parent of Gucci and Saint Laurent, on April 23. The annual results presentation of Swiss group Richemont is expected on May 16.

1jz3nxk,handbags,Handbag purchases,Hey guys wanted to start a conversation regarding the state of luxury fashion and purchasing. I have been buying preloved bags that are made before 2018 from brands like LV to Celine. I have only bought a brand new bag a couple of months ago is the LV nano Madeleine and to be honest i regret it. I paid around $2300 and i don’t think is worth it. Also the new styles don’t interest me and i think they are boring. I am so uninspired to buy any more handbags even though i don’t think I am at purse peace on my collection. Also everything going on with the economy is making me want to save money for the future. Do any of you feel that you don’t want to buy anymore bags and can you share why. ,2025-04-14 16:49:45+00:00,14,21

Im new to handbag collecting, ive been collecting Disney LE 17"" Dolls (mostly Cinderella!) and since everything has kinda settled since the 75th anniversary doll has been released Ive been getting i to handbags. With my new job, I have a little bit more income to play with and looking for a (or purses!) up to the $300-$1,000 range or so. I have been getting Kate Spade and Fossil bags as dailies but want something special for a fancy night out for special ocassions. 

 I would like something sophisticated, and preferably in some of my favorite colors: Navy, denim-blue, Cinderella silver-blue, gold, and Ecru (vanilla-ish color) since I only buy clothes in those colors for the ultimate mix-match wardrobe. I like ammonites or seashells, white pumpkins, anything dark blue especially if theres any fun shapes or designs out there. 

Fine shopping vintage used or thrift/outlet shopping!

I have heard good things about Polene leather, Givenchi, Burberry, Furla, Longchamp (which they have a store in the closest Int'll airport!). I was told Prada and Coach have down down in quality but are still cute. I'm out of the loop for some brands. 

*Additionally, if anyone has any recommendations on smaller/underrated brands in other countries, let me know! Doesnt have to be luxury but would like something unique and high quality to pick up overseas. I will be going to: Hawaii this year, Japan & Iceland next year, and Im dying to go to Lyme Regis in England; I'll be flying to London for shopping on my way down to the Dorset coast if anyone has stores they recommend. Im especially curious if Japan has any cool hangbag brands not obtainable in North America; I'll be in Tokyo but can order mail within Japan to the hotel address.

Loewe is one of my favourite brands to watch over, despite not owning anything from them. Their creativity, craftsmanship, and design is always just delightful. I am always looking forward to their handbag launches, and those bag charms are just too adorable! Yes, the puzzle bag has always been on my mind for years and years, and this community definitely makes me swoon after Flamenco after hearing all about the supple soft nappa leather! 

Come and see all the LOEWE world exploration from the rich history of the past and how the brand blooms through Jonathan Anderson’s direction to the Loewe of the present and future we know and love. 

From handbags, leatherwork, fashion, styling, exploration of colours, textures, composition, along with celebration of craftsmanship and their collaboration with artists and designers around the world. 

Shoutout to the architects who curated a beautiful exhibition designed by OMA. They really explored a playful, colourful and masterful maze, a 4 dimensional  interactive experience yet grounded and true to the brand, a truly memorable spatial experience. 

If you get the chance, please visit this free exhibition in person! Otherwise, follow along and enjoy these carousel of pictures ☺️

1jyyyik,handbags,Help Me Find My Unicorn,"Currently carrying a Lo & Sons Pearl.  Reasons:

1. I like the WEIGHT of the bag; it's not terribly heavy
2. Size is almost perfect
3. Strap is a quick easy conversion to shoulder bag or cross-body when needed
4. Key Leash

Why I need something different:

1. This bag is just not quite big enough (I think due to its arrangement of compartments)
2. While easy to convert; the strap is not comfortable on my shoulder, it's too thin and stiff
3. It does not have any kind of ""wow factor"" at all, it's very plain

So, good people, I ask you to ***please help me find something***.  I'd prefer to stick to mid-range, under $1000. I'd love a phone pocket and a dedicated sleeve/pocket to keep my sunglasses (I switch between regular and sunnies often during the day).  Black is my favorite but I'm willing to entertain a fabulous blue or purple color as it would be a neutral on me.

Prefer a zippered close, but depending on how the bag is designed this is negotiable.  Leather is better due to lifestyle.

It absolutely must be lightweight with good straps.  This is where I get caught up the most.  I have to be able to go hands-free sometimes due to using a cane when necessary.  One of my favorite bags in m closet is too heavy (Hammit Tom).

* Can fit a laptop, charger, water bottle, and a book or two
* Is made of quality material (leather, waxed canvas, or something sturdy)
* Is comfortable to carry (I’m open to tote, messenger, or crossbody)
* Can take a bit of wear without looking destroyed after a few months

I stumbled upon a post about Le Tanneur the other day and fell in love with the Emilie bag in large size.

I'm ready to upgrade my current EDC handbag, and am hoping to elevate into a classic, timeless black/gold satchel. My ideal bag is something I can carry on daily errand runs, but also feels luxurious on vacation, or at a nice fancy dinner.

I've tried on (and fell in love with) the DeMellier Vancouver, but am still stuck between two others I also like a lot! My issue with the Coccinelle is that I cannot find their strap drop measurements anywhere on their site, and I'm pretty particular about a high-rise bag. I like to wear a crossbody at my waist.

1jyl5sv,handbags,We are not patricians supporting artisans…,"Some of yall sound delusional thinking your money spent is supporting artists. There is no such thing as supporting artisans at this stage in capitalism. We’re not in the Renaissance where we’re patrician lords commissioning the next Statue of David or painting by Leonardo Da Vinci. We are in the 21st century where LVMH, Kering, Prada Group, and Luxcottica exists.

Goods “Made in France” or “Made in Italy” are deceptive. They are mostly produced or sourced in China with cheap labor and then making finishing touches in Europe. I know it’s a tough pill to swallow especially when customers are sold a story of supporting legacy brands and craftsmanship—but NOPE—they are mega conglomerates that bought up these fashion houses to turn them into a profit driven machine—making one man the richest person in the world (Arnault). 

And, we should recognize that the quality of “Made in China” is a lot more nuanced. For the longest time, China has been associated with cheap labor and factories whether entirely earned or not. A lot stems from its recent history of poverty, rapid industrialization, and its cheap exploitation BUT also hints of prejudice and borderline racism. In fact, China for hundreds of years was synonymous for luxury goods such as silk, china, crafts and tea until the age of Imperialism.

We need to ask ourselves why something brandished in France or Italy can suddenly make something 10 - 40x more expensive than its true production value. When we equate European goods as inherently superior and Chinese as inferior, it is problematic. But it is understandable since we have been brainwashed for so long to support these brands. It’s time to see beyond the scope and presentation. 

If you want true luxury, get it made in custom or support local artists or small brands. They are real luxury—they are exclusive. Not some profit machine

Victorine

✅ Can fit more cards (8 comfortably according to the SA) 
✅ Functional compartments, has a bill holder and coins compartment 
❌ Slightly big and less cute imo (I’m quite petite, 5”1)

Rosalie

❌ Fits fewer cards (6-7 according to the SA, but will expand / look bulky) 
❌ Only one open compartment (i.e. bills would need to be folded and would cause more bulkiness) and one coins compartment
✅ Smaller and cuter imo

I’ve bought bags online before, but this was the first time I went into a store and treated myself to something a little special. Even though it was at an outlet and cost around $180, it felt so luxurious.

I went for a Kate Spade, and the moment I walked in, I got my own shop assistant (which I’m definitely not used to!). I told her I liked this one bag but wanted to browse a bit more, and she followed me—at a comfortable distance—carrying the bag so I could compare it to others. When I said I’d take it, she brought it to the counter for me, and since it was pouring outside, they even offered a rain cover for the paper shopping bag! That’s never happened to me before.

I don’t have the budget to do this often, but oh my gosh, what a treat. I wanted to share with you lovely folks because this sub is definitely part of the reason I allowed myself to go for it—I’ve seen here how much joy can come from doing something kind for yourself.

Crossposting this from r/luxurypurses\~\~

My LOEWE Flamenco knot came partially undone today upon taking my bag out for the 3rd (!!!) ever time. I've had this bag since November (it's from the latest Suna Fujita collab), but been too intimidated to use it due to the (deliciously) soft leather, light color, etc. Well, I managed to work up the courage to take her out on a proper outing today (shopping w a friend) when I look down in the mall and notice this. Ironic, isn't it???

I'm not the best at advocating for myself so wanted some advice on how to go about contacting LOEWE. I also purchased this online, so I have no store / SA relationship. Figure I'll e-mail, since I'll have to provide pics, or should I call to start?

I'm wondering if I can possibly push to return / refund? I don't think this bag was the best purchase for me, because as cute as it is, I've been so scared to use it!! I assume they won't be able to exchange the bag 1:1 since it's been sold out for months now, but I'd also be open to an exchange, again assuming they'd refund me the difference (this style was more expensive than the normal Flamenco line). I assume the last case scenario would be them repairing the bag, but then I'm out of a bag for however long it takes them to repair it...

This is my first luxury handbag, so appreciate any thoughts on the best way to approach this. Thank you!!",2025-04-13 12:40:49+00:00,13,20

1jxztuj,handbags,first forever bag,"hey friends! looking to purchase my first proper handbag within the next few months as a kind of milestone purchase. Looking at mid-range prices, to an upper end of around $600. I’m looking for a nice but practical black handbag that I can take out to dinner and formal events. I also heavily use my bags, and while I take care of them, I’m not gentle. So, I need something durable, that I can love throughout the rest of my 20s and ideally 30s. 

I’ve been eyeing the polene neuf mini and the polene beri, but am trying to broaden my options. I’ve also just been concerned about the recent Polene reviews around quality and stitching, so I want something that will last. If anyone has alternative brands they recommend please drop them below! 

In terms of my taste, I like most of Polene’s styles, and prefer more rounded shapes. I’ve liked Strathberry pieces but don’t know how I feel about the more prominent hardware. I loved the typical Chloe bags when I was younger, but don’t like a chain strap now. 

Some specifications: 
- black
- fairly small, I have a small frame so I’m not looking for something that will overwhelm me 
- ideally some sort of texture, not the biggest fan of perfectly smooth leather 
- minimal logo  
- if it has an attachable crossbody strap that’s a huge plus 
- semi-structured is good, but not 100% necessary 
- real leather preferably, or extremely high quality faux leather that will definitely hold up 
- ideally some sort of decent zipper/button/closure mechanism going on

I’m not particular on brand, whether it’s a mid size or small brand is all good, I’m just really looking for something high quality that will look nice and be useable for me. This will be a significant purchase for me, so I want to make sure I purchase something I’ll use and love for a long time :) ",2025-04-13 04:44:42+00:00,6,17

My fiancee is going to help pay for it as my wedding gift from him and my budget is around 3k total. I'd love to own a Chanel but obviously that's not in the cards at that price point. I only own two designer bags currently for context, a Gucci Marmont in black and the LV petit palais and am undecided if I want to buy something on the more practical side or get another bag more for going out and special occasions.

I'm considering the Loewe puzzle tote and a Goyard tote on the practical end. I like the YSL Cassandra and Gucci Softbit on the more smaller handbag end. I would love to hear opinions on what people love/dislike/think about my choices. I'm also open to hearing about ones I have't considered but I typically am not drawn to Dior or Celine. 

I'm also open to thrifting for a vintage bag (the Chanel dream is still too far with this but maybe I'll get lucky? lol) and made a list of shops that I researched so if anyone has any suggestions in that regard or can let me know what to expect, I'd appreciate it.

This would also be one of my few luxury bag purchases, a ‘congrats’ to myself for working hard in the past year and earning a decent bonus. In terms of my other bags, it’s an eclectic mix: a few Longchamp le pliages, a pastel pink Furla bucket, a baby blue top-handle Michael Kors, burgundy Kate Spade, then neutral bags from high-street shops.

In terms of clothing, I wear a mix of colours so want something I can match easily with outfits. 🙂

I’ve been looking for the perfect oversized bag that can carry everything I need for my kids and still look gorgeous. I’ve researched so many bags, websites, showed my husband a ton of them and finally ordered this one and I’m so happy I did. This bag is so beautiful!! Way prettier than I expected. It has an adjustable crossbody strap so it can be worn crossbody as well. It is soft, slouchy, but thick so you can’t see every item bulging in the bag. It smells like really nice leather. The color is perfect for how I dress. The inside has pockets and a key ring to attach your key too. I actually designed my own bag with Rough and Tumble but I’m still waiting on it to be delivered in May. Overall 10/10 gorgeous bag that surprised me. I can’t wait for my 2nd one to arrive.

1jxqw7f,handbags,Purse peace - is it possible?,"I have no excuses this time, but I think I've finally achieved purse peace! 🙌 

I am not sure why I gave up on the idea of owning a Bottega Veneta bag during my last shopping trip, perhaps it was the frustration of the larger Jodie not fitting well and I felt deflated, so I left the store empty handed. Didn't even occur to me to try on other styles because I had my heart set on the Jodie. I decided to give it another go because their leather is absolutely divine and I appreciate the signature intrecciato woven design. I tried the small parachute and while I wanted to like it, the handles stick up in an odd way so it would be difficult to wear as a shoulder or crossbody. Then I tried on the small andiamo and I can understand why everyone raves about this bag now. I almost feel like it's underwhelming to see pics online vs trying it on irl and seeing how beautifully it sits on the body. Plus the versatility is insane, I genuinely love it!

Next up is the Loewe mini flamenco clutch and yes I understand I am late to the game on this bag. 😅 It's absolutely a great piece to wear casually or dress it up with the donut chain. Plus how can you resist this colour and the bunnies inside? I also think this is kinda the perfect bag to take on vacation since it packs flat and is very lightweight. 

Lastly, I have fallen in love with this particular shade of red from Gucci, nearly bought the softbit in this colour, but it didn't suit a very large bag. I also tried the horsebit, but I felt this was very similar to the Celine triomphe. Then I remembered ages ago the bamboo line and how badly I wanted one when I was a poor 20 something with only dreams owning a designer anything! I'm not entirely sure why I keep choosing bags with this year in their name (see previous post with the Dior Samourai 1947), but I love what I love, so here she is my Gucci Bamboo 1947. 

Apologies for the lengthy post. This is one of the few places where I can share without judgment and this community has some of the kindest people. ❤️",2025-04-12 20:42:23+00:00,463,96

Considering buying a bag for my GF, total noob though.

I've been looking around ad Yoogi and noticed that RealReal has same products for less most of the time, for example:

If we add $45 to make the bag returnable for realreal it would be $625 vs $415 price difference. That's around 30% of the price so seems like a lot to me. 

Am I missing anything here? Condition seem to be gently used vs good so should be more or less the same. This is only one of the examples as realreal seem to be cheaper overall.

Can you guys elaborate pls?

1jxnjyo,handbags,I got a Quince bag,"It was time for a new daily bag.

My budget was low, under $200, and I wanted leather. I searched all the “close out” stores - like Nordstrom Rack, Saks Off Fifth, etc. - but couldn’t find anything I liked. 

It needed to be a crossbody. Years ago, I found what I think was a quilted leather bag in a bargain bin at Macy’s right after Christmas. It was basically the same style as this Quince bag - and I carried that thing until the leather or pleather started to wear away at the corners (maybe two years?). 

I’m not really a fan of Quince’s clothing, so I’m not sure what made me check their website. But I found this for $119 + tax and shipping, and it came in 3 days. 

Pros:

The leather is so soft and the quilting is perfect

It was nicely packaged and included a dust bag

Construction looks really good

Hardware is heavy

The color I chose is perfectly neutral, will go with anything (though it’s definitely a bit warmer in these photos than real life) 

I love it and it was exactly what I wanted

Cons:

I just know that chain is going to twist up a lot, not sure if anything can be done about that

The interior of the bag is canvas - but it’s a really soft canvas and it’s a $120 leather bag, so they obviously have to cut some corners somewhere 

There’s an indentation at the point of the flap where the closure is; I’m not sure how this could be avoided, but I hope with a little wear it becomes less noticeable 

***

Overall, this was $130 well spent - amazing value. 

They have this medium taupe color, black with gold hw, black with silver hw, and cream. They also have a WOC version of this for $20 less. ",2025-04-12 18:11:26+00:00,200,27

1jxjl0n,handbags,Spring has arrived 💐,"Bit of an impulse purchase, but I bought this Sara Battaglia toy Tati bag online a few days ago and it arrived yesterday. I was really excited because it meant I could take it for a test drive when I went to dinner yesterday evening. 

First impressions are that the yellow is perfect and that it’s quite well made. It has one main interior compartment with a card slot and two slim zipped pockets. The main compartment has a flap cover with a magnetic closure that is incredibly satisfying! I love that it is unique. 

I’ve only used it the one time but I was able to fit two phones, my card case, keys, lip balm, some feminine hygiene products, and my clipa. It doesn’t fit a lot but the accordion style means it can be stretched if I really wanted to cram a bunch in there. 

The only thing I’d change about the bag are the tabs on the zips, which I find a bit too long. 

The straps are slightly misshapen because it seems like it’s been sitting in storage for a long time (this collection is from 2022) but I got the last one in yellow, so I can’t exchange it and I think the straps will get less bent as I use the bag. 

First photo is a stock photo, the next three are pics I took, and the last one is a dress I ordered that’s arriving on Monday that I think will pair beautifully with my new bag. 

Thank you to the Redditors who were answering my questions about Sara Battaglia last week 💛

The stitching where the bag meets the bag strap seems shoddily done, the bottom of the bag is dimpled, and there’s a scuff on the leather. At $650, this wasn’t a cheap purchase!

Personally, I get frustrated digging through my bag for touch-ups during the day, and I’m curious if others feel the same! I’d love to hear about your habits, pain points, and any packaging designs you love or hate.

If you’re open to sharing, here are a few questions. Feel free to answer just one or all!

1. What beauty or personal care items do you usually carry in your purse?

2. Do you have a touch-up routine during the day? Any annoyances with it?

3. Is there anything you wish you could bring with you, but it’s too bulky or awkward?

4. Are there any product packaging designs (applicators, containers, etc.) that you really love or hate? Why?

Feel free to include a little about your age, lifestyle, or how you use beauty products to help me understand who this affects! Thanks so much for reading and helping me out. Your feedback is super appreciated!

1jx091s,handbags,Is anyone else bored by „mainstream“ bags?,"Where I live almost any adult women will have a bag by Alexander McQueen, Guess, or Michael Kors, since these brands offer „affordable luxury“ compared to Chanel or Gucci. But all their designs seem to plain and boring, and waaaay to mainstream in my opinion. I don’t wanna look like everyone else, I‘m always looking for something unique. 

For me, it either has to be the real deal, like a Chanel bag, which are basically pieces od art, or something not every other women is wearing. I finally bought my first „affordable luxury“ bag a couple days ago when a new Karl Lagerfeld boutique opened (not Karl Lagerfeld Paris but the real Karl Lagerfeld. HUGE difference when it comes to quality and design). It’s baby blue with silver hardware, insanely pretty, almost 60s style.

Does anyone else just get bored by those „mainstream“ brands everyone seems to own? (I‘m aware that Karl Lagerfeld is also kinda mainstream, but I’ve never seen the bag I bought on any lady on the street. It’s still a pretty unique item). 

Also, any tips on more „unknown“ affordable luxury brands?

1jwzka6,handbags,Need Help Finding My Perfect Black Bag,"Price range - up to $350 or so. 

What I am hoping I can find all in one bag: 

* Soft quality leather
* Long shoulder strap
* Handles or Handle for carrying by hand
* Zip closure across top of main compartment
* Exterior pocket for 2 smart phone
* Separate exterior pocket for keys and work badge
* Interior large enough to hold wallet, usual toiletries
* Separate (optional that it's separate) section big enough for a MacBook Pro and an iPad Mini

  
Other wishes - lightweight hardware. I bought a B Makowski and ended up hating it because of the heavy metal on it. Made it way too heavy with my things I have to carry for work. I'm ok with metal, just not the heavy stuff or unnecessary stuff that weighs it down. 

I've been looking for a while and am not sure all of this exists in one bag. Any of you know of one that might work?",2025-04-11 20:20:13+00:00,1,17

Looking online I see Tory Burch has some but I can’t tell if it’s long enough to wear around my neck at arm’s length. I’m badging in and out of doors and buildings all day—stooping and swaying my neck in front of badge readers seems hilarious in my head but I don’t wanna do that with a too-short lanyard.

I carry a 16” MacBook Pro, a sketchbook, an iPad Pro 12.9”, a small makeup bag, and sometimes a perfume bottle. Will the strap actually handle all that?

I’ve had two Goyard totes, one strap already snapped and the other one is on the way out lol. I mentioned Goyard because both bags seem to have similar strap thickness (maybe Goyard is slightly thicker?), so I’m just a little nervous. Has anyone used the Large Mochi for carrying a laptop regularly?

Also… I’m kinda torn between Sand Suede and Wine Suede. Both are nice, but the Wine Suede just speaks to me more.

1jwvc53,handbags,Bag brands you wish were still around or still good,"Are there mid-level non-luxury bag companies you wish were still around? I have a couple of bags that were wonderfully made at a mid level price point bit the quality and creativity just tanked after being sold to a conglomerate.

An example is this bag that I bought after landing my 3rd freelance gig in NYC. I bought it at Enzo Angiolini at 551 Madison, the original price was almost $300 but I bought it on sale for $125. 

I still have it. It has been worn in summer and snow through the years, the quality has remained pretty good. This style fell out of favor until Telfar's design, recent 90s and Y2K revivals, and the subsequent interest in Kate Spade's Sam bag. The proportions of this bag still hold, especially the straps. I've started wearing it again this year. 

EA bags are available on a lot of 2nd market sites, but none at this production quality. At the timenthat i bought this, EA always had its own twist in popular styles.

Other than bringing this somewhere local to be repaired, would a Saint Laurent store look at this and fix it (I am in the US, I won’t be back to England for a few monthsAs you can imagine, it wasn’t cheap and I would expect that the leather on a brand like this not break less than a year after purchasing.

I’m in love with the Sage in that range but think Black is more versatile as I want to be able to carry this bag with every outfit I wear and everywhere I go! 
Also love the Dark stone shoulder Tabby but for some reason still like the Quilted one more. I wish they had Dark stone in the Quilted Tabby. 

I do like the Willow as well. What are your thoughts on that? 

Please share your views and help me choose the bag I will not regret buying! 🙏🏼❤️

1jwku4h,handbags,Luxury Brands: Mass-Produced Myth vs. the Art of Custom Craftsmanship,"Ever wondered why a designer handbag or a high-end watch—branded as ""exclusive""—ends up on thousands of shelves worldwide? The truth is, even the most iconic luxury houses rely on mass production at scale. While their marketing spins tales of ""artisanal heritage,"" the reality is often far simpler: standardized assembly lines, generic materials, and a price tag inflated by branding, not craftsmanship.

Let’s talk about materials. Luxury brands frequently use cost-effective fabrics/metals that prioritize durability for mass distribution over true quality or uniqueness. A $3,000 leather tote? Its material cost might barely touch $30. The ""luxury"" you’re paying for? A logo, not luster.

That’s why I’ve shifted my focus to bespoke pieces. Custom-made items aren’t just about personalization—they’re about intentionality. You choose the materials (think ethically sourced leathers, rare gemstones, or sustainably harvested woods), collaborate with artisans who refine every detail, and end up with something that reflects your story, not a corporate assembly line.

Mass-produced ""luxury"" is a commodity; custom craftsmanship is a conversation. It’s time we question the myth of exclusivity and celebrate what’s truly rare: pieces made for you, not the masses.

What do you think? Have you ever compared a luxury item’s hype to its actual craft?",2025-04-11 08:19:34+00:00,1,1

Big Mulberry fan (I first fell in love with the heritage Bayswater 12 years ago). Finally pulled the trigger when my outlet got a beautiful chestnut brown in for $950. When it came in the mail I felt a little disappointed. Boy is it a FLOPPY bag! It sort of melted into a puddle without its stuffing. It’s also heavy as all heck for a medium sized bag. The leather is luxe but the lack of structure and no lining is a really big put off. It doesn’t feel like luxury to me and seems like it will show wear and tear big time due to the lack of structure, lining, and pillow soft leather.

1jwgtzl,handbags,New LOEWE Flamenco medium in vetiver has arrived!,"I had no intention of buying a flamenco this year a but I saw it on sale a few weeks ago from Cettire and I couldn’t pass up -20% (off Australian RRP). It was my first time buying from them and I honestly held my breath until I received the DHL shipping notification and for it to finally arrive in Sydney and pass customs without any extra charge. Ooof that was so stressful to say the least. Reviews are really mixed and complicated for Cettire especially around their customer support and returns. But fortunately, my Loewe arrived within two weeks without any issues.

On to the bag - so far it has exceeded my expectations! I have only seen the small flamenco size in store but not in this gorgeous sagey- teal vetiver colour. It’s a literal chameleon colour- blue in some light and greener in others.
Like many on here have already shared the leather is so freaking soft it just slouches so naturally. It’s unreal.

What fits… 
1. Ipad pro 11”
2. Pouch with card holder, keys, makeup for touchups
3. Glasses case
4. Ipods
It could probably fit a whole lot more, but these are the necessities I move from one bag into another most times. 
A warning though if you are like me and you carry your iPad around, the magnets won’t clasp shut with the iPad in it so it looks like I will have to kind tighten the top a little bit.
I am not phased at all with that but it might be a dealbreaker for when I am travelling. 

I was recommended a neonoe organiser for days I want a bit of structure, so I’ll post again once I receive that.

Hi, everyone! I am madly in love with this bag - it is the All Saints Half Moon Leather Shoulder bag. It is everything I am looking for... It has a slouchy bunched crescent silhouette in a black pebbled leather with an adjustable strap to allow for a shoulder and crossbody look.

I have been hunting around everywhere online to try and find a similar bag in a smaller size and it finally dawned on me to reach out to you fellow purse lovers! Some have been really close but they're usually not very slouchy and instead very stiff or have a smooth finish which I don't like because of potential for scratches.

I was a little worried about getting the small because everything I saw online said “it’s REALLY SMALL!”.

I don’t carry much, and I love a cute bag. I think the small is the perfect size for me. 

This was also my first experience with Fashionphile, since I couldn’t find the Elephant color at any of the retailers (I have since seen one pop up on Neiman’s website). Fashionphile shipped quickly, the bag was packaged well, and it was mostly described accurately. There is a tiny bit of corner wear that was mentioned; however, there are also some weird discoloration marks on one of the strings for the top tie closure. Not a huge deal, but I was surprised to see it.

1jw75fg,handbags,Cuyana’s “system” tote- is it just me?,"So: I use a tote bag for work that needs to be stylish and relatively sturdy, hold a laptop but transition to cocktail or professional situations. I purchased Cuyana’s system tote. I love the color and especially the fact it has a smaller bag inside that doubles as interior pocket, and long strap, so I can simply remove the inside bag and go to events straight from the office. This is not a splurge bag but it is not cheap (over 600$). The issues are: 1)I had to return the bag once because the buttons to attach the insert did not work. The exchange took a few weeks. When I finally had the bag, the small insert is cute and works great but (here’s where I don’t know if it’s just me and curious about your experience) for some reason I don’t like carrying the tote. It slips from my shoulder and when I carry it by the handle it feels awkward. Hard to explain, but it’s like the handle is too long and at the same time too short. Is it me? It looks nice and I keep in my closet but feel like it mocks me and is a constant source of guilt. ",2025-04-10 19:57:12+00:00,5,3
1jw7080,handbags,Help me choose the size pls - longchamp,"Hello everyone, please gather around for this *important* discussion of fashion (in a sense lol)


I wanted to get the longchamp la pliage because it started to grow on me PLUS the price is so good. Especially that I have to travel next week and didn’t want to have a backpack. 

Now, I LOVE the medium size, as I don’t really carry large bags anywhere. But the issue is that I’ll have to bring my MacBook Air 13’’ with me and I read that medium is a tight fit, especially if I want to put other stuff in it. 

I understand that for this purpose the large is probably the right choice but other than travel I don’t really wear large bags, I’m mostly a small bag girly or a medium one, so idk if I can justify the large bag. Can someone like idk, justify the larger purchase or maybe tell me medium will work? I’ll have another carry on with me to travel so I might be able to distribute stuff between the bag and the luggage. 

I haven’t seen the bags irl yet but will do that on the weekend. Thank youuuuuuu <3

Also like what color should I go with??? I love black because you can never go wrong with it but that brown is just so yummy??? I usually wear black mostly and do lots of sports so I feel like black is the best option?? What do y’all think.

1jw6p6p,handbags,The Sak Sequoia thoughts?,"Hey all! I'm getting a jumpstart on Mothers Day shopping, and I came across the Sequoia bag from The Sak. My mom loves bags like this, with a long shoulder strap, zipper, and exterior pocket but I've never bought anything from them before so I was wondering if anyone has had experience with this bag and how it holds up. The Alameda (also from the Sak) is pretty close to what my mom likes, too, so if you prefer one over the other from experience please let me know!

I'm also open to hearing about alternatives in this style from maybe more high-end brands, but mostly I just want to get my mom a nice bag that she'll like. The bonus with the Sequoia is that this icy blue is her favorite color.

Doing some research I found that the Paris brand is supposedly like some franchise, they bought the license to his name but he never had anything to do with it. So it seems all you American friends are left with cheap „knock offs“.

Does anyone have further information on why the hate? I‘m aware that a lot of people don’t seem to understand him and therefore dislike him since he did say some pretty controversial stuff.

I’ve been looking for a handbag for a while, and can’t pull the trigger either through a) indecision or b) forgetting that I’m no longer a broke bitch. I’ve been using a lululemon tote all through residency and fellowship, and while it holds the various bits I keep shoving into it, I think it might be time for something a little more grown up and a little less tattered. 

I’m on the hunt for something that’s 
- big enough for a laptop and its various accessories 
- maybe also a tote?
- I like non standard colours but I’m not bold enough for the weird and wonderful (and am in constant envy of those of you that are)
- leather 
- between $1000-$2000 ideally. I can be convinced to spend a bit more if the quality is worth it

As I was scrolling through preloved websites, I found this beauty in excellent condition at a really great price, and decided to bite the bullet! I’m in love, and can’t wait to style it for the Summer! 

It seems this design is not very popular and I haven’t seen many people with it. As per my research, the bag was launched in 2021. What do we think of her? 😍",2025-04-10 14:09:49+00:00,41,12

But I would love to get one more shoulder/ crossbody bag and can‘t decide which one. I initially thought about the YSL loulou medium in beige or the LV pochette metis. But i’m not LOVING them, I just would love to have a casual bag, which carries enough stuff like a book and sunglasses etc and is not that heavy on the shoulder.

1jvykb4,handbags,Too gaudy?,"Question to all my handbag girlies 
I've recently gotten into handbags and have been on a constant search for a bag that I love and fits into my budget. 

After scouring poshmark, I found this vintage coach 7791 hampton satchel in good condition (at a steal!) that I loved and decided I needed to have. It's missing its strap to turn it into a crossbody which I'm fine with replacing but I knew I wanted to jazz it up a bit.

My question to all of you long time hand bag lovers, is this too gaudy? Too much? Should the chain be shorter or placed on a larger bag?

The more I look at it the more it's growing on me but I just wanted to see what others thought 😊",2025-04-10 13:58:06+00:00,14,12
1jvyh93,handbags,Looking for a work tote with certain specs,"I start working my first big girl job this July and I’ve been looking for a tote that I won’t have to replace anytime soon. I have various bags but nothing with everything I want in one:

- neutral color: black brown beige. Preferably black 
- preferably leather or adjacent for a sleek and sophisticated look
- I will be traveling to conferences for work so something with a trolley pocket to slip onto a luggage bag 
- full zipper closure bc I’m carrying a laptop
- at least a couple of inside pockets 
- fits a laptop 
- not huge like the beis work tote. Around 14.5x11.5 
- max $150/200 
- shoulder straps (not like a satchel vibe and also not a hand tote so my hands are free)
- would be nice to have a water bottle/umbrella pocket either inside or outside but can sacrifice that 

I feel like these aren’t outlandish specs but I can’t seem to find many options. 


I found this but the reviews don’t seem to be the best. Seems like it wears out but it’s a great deal so I might try it?

1jvxjoq,handbags,Compact wallet for mini bags,"Hello, I've been using my Loewe zipped long wallet for years. Since I want to use small/ mini bags more often in the future, I'm currently looking for a compact wallet and this is my shortlist:

1. Chanel small classic flap in lamb skin  
This was put on my list first, but I am worried it’s not compact enough. (10.5 x 11.5 x 3cm)

2. LV Victorine in black or light grey empreinte   
I have heard many good things about this wallet, and that shade of light grey is hard to resist.   
I am curious whether with due care and maintenance, would the empreinte leather in such light colour still look filthy within a few years? 

3. LV Zoe in tourterelle  
I saw some reviews saying this wallet is even more compact than the Victorine, and I love this colour. 

4. Loewe Puff Anagram Trifold wallet

5. Fendi Diamonds

Aesthetically, I like Loewe Anagram and Fendi Diamonds the best, but they are also the most thick ones...  3.8 cm and 4 cm respectively!

1jvh5rc,handbags,New spring/summer bag,"Sooo… I have a small collection to switch bags for specific events or needs or to add color, but I always have a “main bag” (easy to carry, medium capacity, handy with my basics in for everyday use both at work and errands. For reference, work’s dress code is mostly business casual. My current go-to is a coach black hobo bag, surprisingly reasonably priced that has lasted me a couple of years of very heavy use. But I’d like to switch things up for spring and summer with something in a different color and material. I ordered a bunch and have narrowed it down to two. I could purchase two in the lower end (350$tops) OR splurge in only one. Here are my 2 splurge candidates- brown suede rag and bone and blue Tory Burch. Both are comfy, seek sturdy, good size etc. (I was tempted to upload photos of the others as well, so cute, but decided to be practical. Thoughts? ",2025-04-09 21:21:23+00:00,2,3

Newest addition is the Loewe Flamenco Clutch Medium in Sand…and realized my Mini Gate Dual Bag is the same colour, but only adds to the fact that I can alternate straps between them 😁

1jvgllb,handbags,My dream bag finally arrived 🖤,"I was in my 20s when this bag was first released and just starting out my career in the fashion industry. As much as I wanted this bag, it was completely out of scope financially so I put my nose down for years and bought my house, got married, etc. 

And I think with all frivolous things, you forget because they are just bags after all. But a few months ago I saw a post on someone finding their vintage pink version and it triggered this once forgotten dream of mine. 

It was not easy to find. I felt like I had missed the boat completely, but somehow the universe (or algorithms) led me to eBay. Took a risk and now she is mine all the way from France, presenting my Dior Samourai 🖤

I have absolutely no idea when or what to wear with it, but I might just take myself out for dinner to show her off. 🤣

1juy8eq,handbags,Gucci Just Lost Me. Here’s Why,"If you follow fashion even a little, you probably know Demna, the same guy behind Balenciaga’s creative direction (yes, the children in bondage ads) is now leading Gucci.

The fact that Gucci saw all of that and said, “Yes, this is our guy,” tells me everything I need to know.

I am out.

As a mom, and as someone who cares about the ethos of the brands I support, I cannot stand behind a company that ignores this kind of history and calls it “creative power.”

François-Henri Pinault, CEO of Kering, actually said:

“Demna’s contribution to the industry, to Balenciaga, and to the Group’s success has been tremendous. His creative power is exactly what Gucci needs.”

Honestly, I am disgusted that Pinault would not only stand by this but celebrate it.

I am officially done with Gucci. Child exploitation (apology and all) is a hard line I won't cross. 

What about you? Does this change how you see the brand too? I've been eying a classic Jackie bag but I think I'm going to skip it now. 

Curious to know what you Gucci handbag lovers think about this? Would it have any effect on how you view the brand?

UPDATE 1: Wow, I didn’t expect this to blow up.

I’m not here to virtue signal as a comment or two may have said. For me, protecting kids is non-negotiable, and we can all remember how this blew up when it happened so for it to have been swept under the rug and have Demna back at it, felt inappropriate, so I felt I had to speak up. I shared my stance because I genuinely care about the issue and wanted to start a meaningful conversation. We all have our own boundaries and this is one of mine.

I am not getting caught up in political conspiracies or whatever people are trying to spin this into (as some of you may have shared reasons you felt this was political I'm not going by any of this). I saw the photos myself. That's what did it. The images need no conspiracy. They were wrong. PERIOD. 

A child holding a teddy bear dressed in bondage gear is not a conspiracy theory. We can agree that line should have never been crossed.

I also didn’t realize until after the fact that Kering owns both Balenciaga and Gucci. That connection made me think harder about where I spend my money. For everyone saying “every brand has problems” sure, a lot do. No one is pretending to be a perfect consumer. But admitting that everything is flawed does not mean we stop caring.

Instead of wasting energy mocking people who give a damn, use that energy to educate. Drop links. Share resources. Start real conversations. That is what makes a difference.

Feel free to do your own research on this if you'd like, or feel free to google the campaign photos.

I thought some of you could relate to with our shared handbag obsession :) Photo of my birthday presents to myself haha.   
  
I recently celebrated my 37th birthday in Vegas. I have been working hard in my career for 18 years, have known how it is to have absolutely nothing (I have lived on my own since I was 17 and have never received any family or men's help financially). I splurged on 10 days in an entry level suite at a luxury Vegas resort, several fancy dinners, a Celine purse, a Ferragamo wallet and a Dior purse.

I happily purchased everything for me and my husband, he has been unemployed for 8 months now, and this is his third round of unemployment since the pandemic started. I recently skyrocketed in my career after many hard years of work. I needed a break and wanted to treat both of us to a much needed vacation. 

However, almost every interaction was painful. So many workers fawning over my husband but treating me coldly. I don't expect people to fawn over me, but if I am paying for a luxury resort, I at least expect a minimum level of professionalism and service. I have had this happen in the past (people almost always assume my husband is the one who is rich), but it was just so exaggerated in Vegas. Sadly, it was mostly women treating me the worst. They looked at my long nails, lashes and luxury purses - and immediately dismissed me. I'm not even very pretty haha. They would talk around me to my husband, even going as far as to roll their eyes at me a few times, etc. They don't even seem to care that I'm the one handing them my credit card at the end...it seems like so much work for a possible tip, why not just treat all customers...as customers?

1juk6wi,handbags,Here's the process of how I took a Louis Vuitton day planner and turned into a bespoke luxury handbag. Bonus one-eyed cat photo included.,"I work with zero machines 99% of the time. Everything is 100% hand-stitched including the prototypes. And what do stitches need? Say it with me class, ""holes!"" that's right! And yup, I punch those by hand in advance as well.

I made this for a friend of mine who's a fan of my leatherworking. She called me up one day and asked if I could turn her old LV day planner into ""i don't know. Something. I just don't use it anymore"". So naturally, as I was racking my brain one night staring at this canvas I'd just stripped from the most expensive single item I've ever had in my possession, I put it up on its spine side and immediately texted her to let her know we're making a handbag. 

  
So after countless hours of bleed sweat and tears this is the final product. I couldn't be happier with it and she was ecstatic. I think it's my best work to date if I don't mind my saying. ",2025-04-08 18:04:30+00:00,1002,75
1juk4bi,handbags,My review of The Horse - Clementine Mini: the ultimate catfish bag 🙈,"I was fully aware about the mixed reviews for the Clementine bag before i received it, but my friends got it for me for my birthday so I figured whether it was the catfish bag i’ve heard people calling it or not, at least i didn’t pay for it haha

So my review after a few uses is that unfortunately people were correct for the most part about how it does not seem to slouch when worn as a crossbody, and unfortunately there’s nothing i’ve been able to do to save it from looking like a brick 😅 I will say though i think the brown version looks a wholeeeee lot better than the black version when worn crossbody because you’re able to see more of the design of the bag not just its shape. Maybe after a few more weeks of use the leather will soften and it will slouch more, but only time will tell

Despite that though, I really do looove this bag when just used from its top handle. The slouch is perfect from day 1, and even when set down it maintains its shape!

Also for quite a low price (imo) it’s full leather and quite unique compared to my other bags, and i do love the feel of the pebbled leather 

Even though I’m a big crossbody fan, the fact that it’s just so adorable from its handle is enough for me to accept it will just not look that cute when I inevitably wear it crossbody for convenience.

Sisters from a different mother:  I recently bought a Kate Spade Madison small for €152 (original price in EU is €399), just because it looks like my Prada Esplanade. It has the same saffiano leather (swipe to photo #2) and the same structured boxy design.  Now there is an even more similar Prada esplanade with handles in a bigger size, but I prefer smaller bags with lesser components, lesser parts to breakdown.

The Kate Spade madison has lighter gold tone hardware. But when worn using the back side, people always mistake it for a Prada due to its saffiano leather.",2025-04-08 09:55:07+00:00,76,24

Since then, I’ve only used the bag fewer than 8 times during a recent trip to Japan. However, I’ve already observed signs of wear and tear that seem unusual given the limited use.

I’d like to ask:
	•	Is the Andiamo bag known to be this delicate?
	•	Would this kind of wear be covered under the lifetime warranty?
	•	If so, can I bring it to one of your stores here in Manila, Philippines, for inspection or possible repair?

1jtxbi5,handbags,Bags WITHOUT dividers?,"Maybe I’m the only one, but I HATE the dividers in purses. It makes it so much harder for me to find anything because I have to dig around in all these compartments to find what I’m looking for.

Does anyone know how I can find these kinds of purses without dividers?? (A pocket in the lining is okay, it’s just the big divider in the middle that bothers me.) Please help!

The marriage left me in $18k debt and destroyed my self esteem and “joy” for life. I managed to pay off all my debt last month and started solo traveling to help myself rediscover who I am. 

don’t want to jinx anything… but I think I made it out the trenches. To commemorate, I bought myself this bag. The most expensive bag I own now. I even sent myself a note to look back on…🫣🥺🥹

For reference I am 6’1 215lbs. This bag is part of the men’s collection, but there is a smaller women’s version.

1jtn5af,handbags,Bag recs for frequent traveler after a theft :(,"UPDATE: I went for the Senreve Aria. Thank you all so much for your recs. While there are differing opinions as to benefits of compromisng style for the benefit of safety, I dress for myself and am open to small risks (no, I'm not young, no I'm not aspirational. Although this is a reddit post, I also do not debate.) I rarely fly through JFK, and even more rarely have a bag's strap break which created the safety risk. 

Since I couldn't file a police report on site (nearly impossible at JFK, and I'm a Queens native!), I'm working through remote options so that I can file an insurance claim. To answer remaining questions, this was post security, in terminal 5 by the small food court area. I no longer live in NY, am not interested in reviewing tape, nor was it offered. If I can file a claim, great, otherwise I eat the loss. Truly, I am so very grateful for all of your love and concern. This is my favorite sub for a reason. You all really made my day yesterday. xoxo.

Original post:

So sad... my Polene numero un was stolen right off my body at JFK last week (I'm a native New Yorker with no naive behaviors, and my wrist still hurts :() along with Polene neuf wallet. One of the reasons for the theft was that the brass fixture for the strap broke the am of the theft (after only 2 years), forcing me to carry it over my wrist. Given recent global concerns about Polene's quality besides the strap breaking, I need something new that will be easy to protect during frequent travels.

My daily bag is a CH blason in blue, and I'm thinking about the Senreve aria. [https://www.senreve.com/products/aria-belt-bag-pebbled?variant=39827605225560v](https://www.senreve.com/products/aria-belt-bag-pebbled?variant=39827605225560v)

My only concern is that I'm super petite (5 foot, slim build), and the bag could look out of scale for me like the numero un did when I wore it crossbody, but that could also be because the strap was disproportinately long. Would love your opinion on this bag, or something else that might be a great fit!

You can ask questions about specific bags that don’t require an entire  review to see if anyone has the answer!

We are doing this so that we can start building up an FAQ so that your  questions can be more easily answered. Questions are NOT restricted to  this post, especially if those questions involve discussions! If you have posted in a previous Weekly Question Thread but your question was not answered, feel free to repost it again. 

Here are some example questions:

1. Can an iPhone 13 Pro fit in the Loewe Mini Puzzle?
2. What bag can I use in the rain under $X?
3. Does this bag match this outfit? (Can be asked in this thread or as a discussion post).
4. Has anyone had any experience shopping at <boutique> in <city>?

Examples of what NOT to post:

1. What bag are you wearing today? (This would be better as a discussion post).
2. Where was your best boutique experience? (This would be better as a discussion post).
3. Review  request for Mlouye! (There’s a chance someone who’s purchased won’t see  it as a comment and may be better off as a post for now).

1jtkio8,handbags,My second Mlouye!,"I have been eyeing the Mini Flex Bag for a while as my collection lacked a mini sized bag. I was torn between this Bordeaux color and the shiny patent leather version but decided on this as I thought it was a versatile color for both daily use and night outs. I was delighted how good and vibrant this color looks in person. 

My dream bag is a red Jackie however I know that I will never spend that kind of money on a bag, so I have decided on this bag as a substitute in my wardrobe. 

My wallet, Iphone 14, lipstick, keys fit comfortably. Sunglasses fit on top of these only without the case so beware. 
 
Previously I had a Sera mini tall tote from Mlouye which I also love. I find that within extremely expensive boring designer bags nowadays, their bags are a fresh of air as they are much more affordable and have fun designs and versatility. ",2025-04-07 12:53:06+00:00,191,8

1jthqad,handbags,Wishlist Bag Acquired 🥹,"I’ve had the Celine 16 on my wishlist for almost 2 years now. Loved it and it fit a gap in my collection - an elegant structured top handle bag that had a crossbody option so it was functional. But it was outside of my budget and I had a whole Goldilocks predicament to which colour I wanted:

- I love the Amazone colour but had just gotten a Triomphe bag in Amazone
- I didn’t want a second Black Celine bag because I already have a Nano Belt Bag in Black
- I didn’t want it in a light colour

I also wanted it in the Small size which doesn’t come in as many colours as the Mini size. So I held out, hoping that maybe Celine would release new colours.

Until I saw a post here last year about this exact size in Burgundy and I knew that was the colour for me. But the Redditor mentioned it was an exclusive colour plus she purchased it in Europe and I was a couple of months late to that post. 

So I waited again. Hoping Burgundy would show up on my side of the world. 4 months later, I saw it on a Celine ad on Instagram and it finally showed up on my country’s website, but it was listed as “Get Notified”. On a whim, I reached out to my SA for help. It took almost a month but they managed to source one from another country but it was heavily creased at the back.

Now I’m ok with creases on bags because of wear BUT I don’t like it when new bags come creased because those creases are mine to create with the bag!

So back to the drawing board and my SA said no worries, they’ll source it from 2 neighboring countries which showed stock availability. Alas, both had pre existing marks but.. fret not, they found another one in a third country .

I waited 4 more weeks before I got the text that the bag had arrived and after giving it a preliminary check through photos, she’s now finally mine 🥹 my search had to go international and it took months but I got exactly what I wanted 😍

I forgot to mention, this was a very belated birthday gift from my partner and I’m so glad I didn’t rush into a bag buying decision so I could have this beauty.",2025-04-07 10:08:14+00:00,988,63

1jsy3yk,handbags,"Looking for a dark brown shoulder bag, medium or large, not too heavy, open to considering nubuck/suede","Hi! I'm looking for a shoulder bag with the only requirement that it should be dark brown (like the bag pictured here). 

The size could either be a medium (i.e., enough for essentials, plus a sweater, a water bottle) or large (i.e. enough for all the above plus a laptop - but not like my whole house). I would especially prefer a medium size, though.

One important requirement is that it be not too heavy, due to back problems - so preferably well below 1kg (e.g. I love the Longchamp Foulonne line for being such beautiful leather yet so lightweight! But unfortunately doesn't come in dark brown)

I'd be happy with classic (full grain) leather, but I'm also open to nubuck (which I love, but is so rare in bags) and suede.

And finally, for the shape, I'm not sure how to describe my preference - but I'd say classical, clean lines, with a mix of structural and slouchy? Examples of shapes I love are the bag pictured here, and the entire Longchamp Foulonne line.

In terms of budget, I'd prefer to stay below €800, with some flexibility if it's absolutely worth it (I don't care about brand names). And I'm based in Europe, so I would prefer to buy from EU brands.

Would love to hear any suggestions along these lines from this lovely community! Thank you all so much ",2025-04-06 16:30:04+00:00,3,7

If it helps, the first two handbags are from Salvatore Ferragamo, third is from Ralph Lauren - Lauren, and fourth is from Max & Co

1jsq50q,handbags,Advice regarding SSENSE order 🙇‍♀️,"Hi everyone, would really appreciate advice from any US based folks who have purchased from SSENSE before/recently. 

I’m a bit stressed out right now because what should have been an exciting thing (purchasing a bag) has now become a big source of anxiety. 

I, unfortunately, didn’t know or realize SSENSE is a Canadian based company and I placed an order for a $2000 bag from them on April 3. The bag has already shipped and is currently with US customs. 

Given that the bag is coming from Canada, I am now stressing out about the potential fees I’ll have to pay in order to get the package released from USPS as I didn’t account for this added cost since I hadn’t realized SSENSE was based in Canada. I know that’s totally my fault for not paying attention and being a smarter consumer especially in this climate. That said, the order has already been placed and shipped. I’m worried about what the additional fees will cost and if it comes down to it, I may end up refusing the package and returning to sender. SSENSE has already confirmed that if I did that, they would issue me a refund once they receive the package back. 

If anybody can comment on their recent experiences with SSENSE orders & customs and duty fees, I’d really appreciate it. Or if anybody has ever refused the package, I’m hoping you can share your experience on that as well as far as whether you had to pay for return shipping or if there are any other things I’m overlooking. I’m getting really worried that if the package gets lost or something, I will just lose my $2000 :(
  
What would you do?

Thanks so much everybody. All I wanted to do was celebrate a milestone :(

My room gets zero direct sunlight and is generally pretty dim. This gentle, dim Ikea lamp is the only light source in the room (the window is covered by pull down shade).

As you can see, unorganized purses are strewn around the lamp. My question is, if this lamp is on every evening for 10-12 hours, would it photo bleach the bags around it?

I like it because of the smooth leather that’s box calf (oh patina), plus the magnet is super satisfying. But the shoulder chain strap I wish was a leather strap that can be adjusted to a shoulder strap.

##Time Square Tabby:
I like that the shoulder strap has a leather portion and it definitely can be an everyday bag as well as a special occasion bag. I also love the canvas interior.

I like that it can be adjusted as a shoulder or crossbody bag with just one strap.

1jsfawp,handbags,Chanel sweet camellia,"I’m back to post my unboxed bag! I’ve been looking for the right bag to be my first Chanel for a couple of years. Here’s why I chose this one after much consideration:

I knew I didn’t want a double flap bag because I didn’t like the fussiness of the interior flap and the way it reduced the interior spaciousness, but I also didn’t like how the classic single flap bags could only be worn one length (non-adjustable strap).

With the sweet camellia bag, I was thrilled that they took the silhouette of the single flap but used the same adjustable chain as in the classic wallet on chain! 

I would have been happy with this bag in beige or navy, but not black. So I am so glad that I came across this beauty! I absolutely love this shade of beige. Chanel has multiple beiges, but I dislike the original darker yellowy beige. The SA said that the color of my bag was called true beige, and it’s lighter and has a pink undertone. In photos it can almost read as ivory/cream, but in person it’s just a very beautiful cool-toned light beige. 

Finally, I love that the hardware wasn’t shiny gold but antique gold. I felt that it made the bag less flashy and conspicuous, which is what I wanted. 

All in all, the perfect bag for me. I was pleasantly surprised that despite being a seasonal Chanel, the interior is fully leather-lined. However, it looks to be made in Italy and not France like the bags of their classic lineup, which maybe means that the craftsmanship or leather quality aren’t as good as the French bags. 🤷‍♀️ But, I could see no defects upon inspection, and I’m overall very very happy with my bag. I am so in love with it!

1jsdprg,handbags,Keep or return: Alexis Bittar clutch,"Let’s start by acknowledging that generally I feel if something isn’t an “F yes” it goes back.

But, this strategy has kept me in a wardrobe gap situation for over five years now - and the only thing I’m worried about is gold vs silver hardware.

Backing up:
My daily driver is a tote; and my key need is a smaller bag I can bring when I travel and have dinners out. I also occasionally need for something cocktail / black tie. I guess I thought one bag could hit both needs, but it’s been years of looking for the perfect thing. I am starting to think it would be better to get two bags vs one unicorn to do it all. I could spend up to $5k (or I would get the Hermes Kelly Cut and call it a day!).

I thought the Celine 16 small was going to be IT, but when I tried it on I didn’t have a “F yes” reaction, and that’s way too much to spend on something I don’t love. The other one I liked from Savette now doesn’t seem to come with silver hardware. I REALLY like the Loewe Flamenco, and think I could get a lot of use out of it - although I’d prefer a great color since I wear a ton of black - but it’s not going to work for cocktail / black tie.

I’ve had my eye on this Alexis Bittar clutch for quite a while - I love the sculptural handle and I think the only drawback is that it has gold hardware, while my wedding rings / watch / staple necklace are platinum / white gold / silver. I just picked it up on sale for under $500.

I've been a MAJOR fan of Portland Leather Goods for a couple years now, and they recently released their Large Naomi bag in Pink Suede, and I was instantly sold on it. It is PERFECT! So soft and slouchy -- it is exactly what I was looking for.

In case you're curious, the PLG Large Naomi is 11"" x 12"" x 5"", with strap drop length of 12"". While the shape is slightly different, it is relatively comparable to the Coach Brooklyn 28 at 11"" x 11"" x 3.5"", with a strap drop length of 10.5"". Plus, the PLG bag was only $78 because I got it from their Almost Perfect line. 😅 I can't resist the opportunity to save a little money.

1js77rt,handbags,New cow hide bag - are the bald spots normal?,"

I just bought this Campomaggi bag I've been lusting over for months, and when I unpacked it (I bought it online) I noticed it has a few bald spots, for lack of a better word. I would ask the store about this, but they don't specialise in leather goods, and in any case I won't be able to go back there for a few more days, so I figured I'd ask here first. 
Is this just what hide looks like sometimes, naturally imperfect, or is this more likely something like a quality control issue or a defect that happened in the hands of the retailer?

It seems perfectly reasonable to me that many animals (cows in this case) will have inconsistencies in the growth of their fur or hair, and as such it translates into the wares being made of their hides. I mean, with a material this raw you have to expect imperfection. And if it *is* to be expected that this is just how some hide bags look, if this quirk was intentionally allowed within the production of these bags, then I dont mind it at all. These spots do look well-treated and consistent, not like areas that were never meant to see the light of day. But I'm not experienced in assessing this kind of thing, and I can only find like one single product image of this bag online, so I dont really have any other specimens to compare it to. I'd really appreciate you guys' insight!",2025-04-05 16:23:38+00:00,6,4

the thing is, I bought a black songmont luna with silver hardware last March 10, which arrived a few days ago. Functionally, both bags serve the same purpose: casual days out, dinners with friends, or even formal events.

to complicate things further, i also booked another international trip just last week. these bags aren’t cheap for me (im only 23), and honestly, i haven’t fully recovered from all the expenses i’ve racked up since january.

while i’m doing well financially, i’ve always had a personal rule: i have to earn back what i’ve spent before allowing myself another big purchase. breaking that rule makes me feel guilty, no matter how much i like the item.

if i don’t buy the bag, i’ll feel proud for sticking to my principle but i might regret missing out on the experience of buying it in-store (i’ve only bought luxury bags online) and getting the bag at a retail price. there’s no polene store near me, and I don’t plan on traveling again soon just to buy a bag.

buy if i do buy it, i know i’ll enjoy using it every single time… but i’ll still feel guilty about not waiting and not following my rule. ",2025-04-05 14:52:47+00:00,2,15

1js4qy3,handbags,Unexpected purchases.  Interesting Goyard experience in Paris.,"Not sure if the haul flair is accurate since it’s only two items, but anyway.

I was in Paris and walking past the smaller goyard, I saw the flower bag in the window.

I effing love flowers, so I wanted to see it in person, even though I’ve not been a fan of the goyard St. Louis bags I’ve seen out and about.

However, I read in this sub that people’s grandmas used to use theirs as a beach tote like 100 years ago, so that softened my stance on them. I am nothing if not into some fancy shit a grandma could use as a beach bag.  

Anyway, when we get in, the SA I suppose was “assigned” to us wasn’t being very accommodating.  I’m not used to this in other luxury goods stores where we are usually offered champagne etc.

Keep in mind, I had no intention of buying Goyard so I have no idea what anything is called, what has recently launched, what’s limited edition or whatever.  I literally am just looking for what I like, with zero knowledge.

My husband asked about the flower bag, and she said they are sold out, we asked about the one in the window and she said she can’t sell us those.  (Smaller one in the iris and larger in the fuchsia).  Oook.  

Then we asked about a cute little green bag with a wooden handle.  She tells us that not just anyone can buy that bag, and while it’s not expensive, it’s like getting a Kelly or a birkin.  She would have to get permission from the manager to let me look at it.

I told my husband (in front of her) that I don’t want to play games, and I’m not spending money on crap I don’t want in order to be able to buy it… assuming that it was a situation like how one gets offered a birkin. 

My husband is like no, go ask the manager.

She comes back, and says that she has permission because she pled our case because we weren’t able to buy one of the bags in the window.  Not sure about that but whatever, I like the bag.

She takes us down to a little private room in the store, sits down behind a desk with gloves on and shows me the bag. I like it, I tell her I want the one with the hand painted heart (only €310 more lol).  And suddenly I’m allowed to buy the bag in the window.  So I buy that too.

I love the flower side, I used it to lug two wine bottles, meat, cheese, olives, bread and a sweater to our swine river tour, and it did the job admirably just like grandmas beach tote.

1jrv5t0,handbags,Opinions on the Lauren Ralph Lauren Tanner Shoulder Bag?,"Hi Handbag Baddies! I was browsing the Macys site and noticed this beautiful Lauren Ralph Lauren bag. It’s the Leather Medium Tanner Shoulder bag. The shape is reminiscent of styles like the Coach Brooklyn Shoulder bag and the red color caught my eye. The Macys and Ralph Lauren website mention that this bag is made from supple full grain leather. It doesn’t have a zipper but does have a dog clip closure. Unfortunately, I can’t find any reviews of this particular bag apart from the reviews on the retailer sites. Anyone have this bag or any of the Tanner line bags and can share their opinions on the leather and quality of the bag? 

I’ve been very conscious with my bag buying habits recently and haven’t bought anything since last August (and that too was just a Baggu crossbody on sale, my only bag purchase in 2024). This year, I gave away two Coach bags (the only ones I had and the only high end brand in my collection) to relatives as gifts because after the initial few uses back in 2023 and maybe once or twice in 2024, I didn’t see myself reaching for them. However, this Ralph Lauren bag is speaking to me. While red is a vivid color, I can actually see it at an accent color to most of my wardrobe and I’ve wanting a bag in this style for a while. Would greatly appreciate any reviews on this bag, thank you in advance! ",2025-04-05 04:16:49+00:00,5,3

1jrs7h7,handbags,Cafuné Stance Wallet ✨,"Just received my new Cafuné Stance Wallet in chestnut! I was looking for a mini bag in brown and the price was right so I went for it despite only seeing a couple reviews of the brand.

First impression: The leather smelled amazing first thing upon opening the package. It is very soft, smooth, and supple. The bag seems to be constructed very well. The shape is chic and kinda scratches that Mini Kelly itch.

As for the size, I’m not sure calling it a wallet is quite accurate. I guess it technically is a wallet because it has built-in cardholders, but I’d call it more of a mini bag. It’s small, but it fits the essentials no problem. I attached pics showing the inside and what I put in it. I had my phone, cardholder, car keys, and a small pouch with chapstick, mints, etc in it and there was still room. There is a zipped pocket on front and back. My phone did not fit into them, they’re better for a cardholder or receipts or something.

As for the downsides of the bag, I don’t love the strap. It’s quite dinky and thin. Also the interior lining is made of recycled polyester, which is part of a sustainability effort (explained on the Cafuné website). I appreciate the sustainability of course, but I have to point out that it feels scratchy and cheap, especially compared to how nice the exterior is. 

Anyway I hope this was helpful to anyone considering the Stance Wallet! Included lots of pics as I know that is ideal. Overall I’m very happy with the purchase and think I’ll be grabbing for this bag quite a bit throughout the spring and summer months!",2025-04-05 01:30:16+00:00,43,2

1jrs0a1,handbags,DO NOT send your items to Rebag!,"I sent an authentic, limited edition Goyard and branded beach towel to Rebag for consignment. After it arrived at their warehouse, they sent me a price estimate that was significantly below what I’d been cited online. The description of the bag’s flaws was inaccurate — it said the corners had damage, which they certainly did not — so I rejected their offer, which triggered their return of the product to me. When it arrived, I was shocked to see that 1) the bag had been squeezed into a significantly smaller box than I’d sent it in, 2) put in a bed of newsprint paper, 3) with the dust bag inside the bag, something I’ve never seen before when buying bags or getting items returned to me by The RealReal or Fashionphile. But the last problem is the biggest, which is 4) that I had sent the bag to them with the coordinating towel that Goyard sold with the bag, which was itself wrapped in another dust bag. The towel and the dust bag were not returned to me! I thought it might’ve been an oversight that could be easily fixed but the customer service rep I was connected to via email very rudely told me that Rebag is not responsible for “collateral.” Perhaps one could consider the dust bag to be collateral but the towel that was sold by Goyard as part of their limited edition offering is part of the product, just as the little pouch is, and is certainly not collateral in my view. It is part of the product and not secondary to it. Here’s why: when Rebag has sold this product before, they’ve sold the bag and the towel as one item! (As did Goyard and as does every other consignment and resale shop.) 

The customer service person I’ve been dealing with has been absolutely rude and dismissive to me, and has offered no way to ameliorate the situation. I was having trouble finding the terms of the consignment contract on their website and she wouldn’t even email me their boilerplate text! I have no idea how much this will hurt the price that I’ll be able to get for the bag or how long it will take for it to sell, but I have to imagine the impact will be in the hundreds if not thousands of dollars for an item that they were going to price just above $5000. I am pursuing this through the BBB but since I did not send any money to Rebag and had part of my item returned to me, I’m concerned that the company will be able to wiggle out of providing me any restitution. So here I am on Reddit on a Friday night urging my fellow bag lovers not to send their items to Rebag. And I’d also suggest not buying from them, considering how poorly they treat people who send their items to the company. 

Has anyone else had a similar situation with Rebag? Did they ever provide you with any restitution? Has anyone found an effective way for the customer service department to not treat you like garbage?",2025-04-05 01:19:30+00:00,3,2

Not that anybody asked.","For starters, I was curious about the markups, so GPT research (a paid feature) told me this . It's an interesting read.

Moving on. At first glance, I really liked what I was seeing from hermes, loewe, and bottega, seemed like decent value propositions over the obvious cash grabs like LV, Dior, or other type brands. I thought Prada's selection was interesting as well. Also shout out to coach, a bit boring but, for the price, I think they make a really good product with good QA if you stay away from ""outlet"". Now, I'm not saying my opinions are valid, but I just can't help but think these bags from any brands with 2k+ priced bags are just ridiculously over priced. We're talking about less than 300 dollars in materials, and labor + materials almost 100% of time won't top 1,000. These people aren't engineering, these processes are well established, it should not be that expensive. The one thing I DO appreciate is MOST of the time, higher price, higher QA. QA is important to me. That said, from a purely aesthetic standpoint, despite looking through the entire catalog of every major brand twice, Polene is really doing it for me. Hope you ladies have a good day, looking forward to the insight from you guys.",2025-04-05 00:12:21+00:00,0,24
1jrqi9k,handbags,My Frank Clegg travel duffle is here!,"Frank Clegg is a small company out of Fall River, MA. They use only the best leathers from France and the best solid brass hardware out there. 

This is the small travel duffle in chestnut belting leather with the matching strap that’s not shown. It’s full grain, veg tanned leather with a sunbrella lining. The striations (stretch marks as I see them, lol) are what I was hoping I’d get! I used to make leather bags at homes (many, many years ago as a hobby for a short while) and I’d always be on the look out for hides with prominent striations. I customized it by adding a second pocket on the inside and had my initials heat stamped on the outside. Working with Candice from customer service was a dream when I had questions or requests. 

A lot of their bags are frequently out of stock. 5-7 weeks is the wait time but I ordered mine on the March 3rd and it was shipped by March 27. 

Specs:

•Width: 17”
• Height: 10.5”
• Depth: 8.5”
• Weight: 4 Lbs.

The perfect overnight/carry on/personal bag. 100% recommend if looking for a bag that will last for many years to come! The leather is so thick and smooth. 😍 This also comes in a tumbled leather if you’re into softer bags.

However, I've been through a lot of growth in the past few years and decided to purchase a bag to commemorate. I know it's not ""true luxury"" but to someone who grew up on government  assistance it means the world to me that I can spend a few hundred dollars on a handbag and it not be a big deal at all. 

I bought the Dooney & Bourke Florintine Satchel in nano size, navy, after spending about 6 months considering it. My husband was the one to encourage me to finally make the purchase though. Added on the small purse on a whim, and I am in love with them both! I am a small handbag type gal so this works for me, but if you are into carrying around a lot of stuff you might want to go for the micro or the regular size.

1jrjhuu,handbags,Help me find a Mother’s Day gift!,"I’d like to get my wife a buy-it-for-life bag.

We are done having kids and finally transitioning out of the diaper bag phase and my wife would like to downsize.

We don’t like in your face logos. We want something that is well put together and will last her forever. She’s not really into high fashion. So it’s more function and form than trendy.

Here are the things it would need to hold:

* notebook/planner (paper not laptop)
* phone
* wallet (it’s a little handbag/purse)
* keys
* water bottle (Nalgene 32oz I believe)
* hygiene stuff (not makeup/perfume), but cyclical stuff and hand lotion.

And right now snacks for the kids would still be great to fit.

Bags that have caught my eye as being her style:

* Cocinelle Beat Soft (backpack)
* Louwe puzzle small

As far as budget those two have a massive discrepancy. I’m probably willing to spend $3k/$4k if it’s high quality and well designed. I don’t really want to buy a name if that makes sense. So I’d certainly rather spend $300-$500 if we can get a very well made, functional bag that will last her forever and avoid paying name premium.

Thinking brown/tan/black as it’s kind of going to be a one bag deal.

She dresses in a lot of Boden and Calvin Kline A-frame dresses conservative colors (blacks, blues, burnt orange) and floral prints. So a purse that would kinda match that style, color variety.

Thanks for the help, [r/handbags](https://www.reddit.com/r/handbags/)!",2025-04-04 18:50:22+00:00,2,5

1jrj1kn,handbags,Work bag I can put my shoes in,"So I work a few days a week in an office space where I can’t really leave my shoes (partially because storage, partially because I have client meetings the rest of the week and need them!). I’m NYC based and commute via public transit and a lot of walking, so comfy shoes when commuting is a must (plus I don’t want to get crud on my shoes). 

I currently have [this tote](https://www.dagnedover.com/collections/classic-tote) from Dagne Dover, which I love for the size, the chain for my keys (lifesaver when I’m coming home and don’t want to fumble around in my bag), the pockets, and the water bottle holder. 

That being said- the bag isn’t really my style. Outside of work I tend more towards Beara Beara, Fable England, vintage Coach, London Fog, and even some more eclectic choices like a carpetbag for travel. I work in the history field so I can absolutely lean into that urge for me! I lean towards dark brown leathers and very classic styles- but it has to be able to close by zipper as well as fastening because when I travel I’ve run into pickpockets. 

What I usually have in my bag- granola bar, lipstick, concealer, compact, wallet, business cards, keys, water bottle, meds, and my kindle. I don’t need to schlep around a laptop but I do often have legal-size folders on me for documents, and sometimes do have regular books in it as well. I also usually have a small umbrella, a scarf, and some other odds and ends like a mending kit and such. My workdays are very long, as is my commute, so I need to have all my stuff with me. 

Any ideas?",2025-04-04 18:31:06+00:00,4,5
1jrivyq,handbags,OKAYYY AllSaints!,"I just picked up the AllSaints Ursa Grain Leather Satchel and it is gorgeous! It’s got a structured shape but a slouchy softness, which is my favorite bag style. The leather is SO soft and smells delicious. It fits everything I usually carry (water bottle, iPad, wallet, keys, work & personal phones) and still maintains that relaxed vibe. 

It has one large main compartment and two pockets, one inner and one on the front under the flap, which has a magnetic closure. The handle is long enough to be a shoulder bag or a handbag, not a crossbody, which was not a concern for me as I don’t use crossbody bags but could be a dealbreaker for someone who does. My only minor complaint is that it doesn’t have feet, but I’m not too pressed about that. 

My usual every day bag is a medium Puzzle, but since high end bags are not necessarily appropriate all the time, I wanted something that would fit that same vibe on a more reasonable note. This definitely fits the bill, and is perfectly slouchy right out of the box, no need for wearing in like the Puzzle.",2025-04-04 18:24:41+00:00,6,2

1jret1s,handbags,Handbag suggestions,"I need ideas and suggestions about what kind of purse to get. 

I'm looking for a handbag that either has a zipper completely stitch through, no gaps, or a metal enclosure. 

I want the inside to resemble a tote bag, no weird inside pockets in the middle of the bag. Pockets along the inner walls are acceptable.

I'm leaning towards a Boston bag for this purpose.  

I don't like any logos. The more minimal the logos / advertising, the better. 

I prefer a medium-sized bag, in a shade of green would be appreciated. Along the lines of an emerald green is what I had in mind. However, as long as it's green, it's fine. Some floral embroidery is alright as well.

Black or brown are a good second choice of color and probably more realistic. 

The budget is 1,000$.

2. Chloe (pochette) - around 1000 euro in my area
3. Coccinelle C-me - around 350 euro in my area

Which do you think is the best one? The Chloe bag just seems so small and the price is quite high, I am leaning towards Jacquemus but I don't know if it's a good brand (I am still unexperienced as it's actually also the first handbag that I am buying someone).

My budget should be up to 1000, but ideally in the \~700-800 area, would appreciate suggestions on what you think is the best pick from my list, but also some other suggestions from your side on this price range. I am going for a black color bag as I think it's safer.

**What I've done so far:**

* I started with ensuring it was real from one of the recommended sites from this Subs rules.
* I've googled and tried to find ways to find the pricing of the bag but can't seem to find anything.

**Bag backstory, for those who are curious:**

Basically, I have a ""like new"" Fendi bag. I think it's a tote bag? whatever that means. It belonged to an Ex who got it when she was a teen but never used it out of resentment to her rich parents. She was going to trash it one day as she hated what it stood for. But the poverty deep in my bones couldn't watch her trash a new designer purse as to my knowledge, they were expeeeeensive. So I proposed instead that I just make it ""disappear"" for her. I never did find it a home and fasionphile seems like a low offer fear years ago. Now it's been on my shelf in a bag/box for years, after being on her shelf in a bag and box for a decade+.

(**Side story this subreddit will appreciate**. While on a work trip an executive at my job was making small talk and told me that his friends wife started a company years ago selling used handbags and present day their revenue was over 1Bn recently.  
I said ""....what the F!@#, do they own fashionphile or something!?""....and he goes ""yeah! fasionphile! how do you know about them?"". ....Mind blown. )",2025-04-04 14:40:02+00:00,3,9

1jrbohv,handbags,Vestiaire Collective sold me a fake and is gaslighting me,"
Just wanted to share my experience with Vestiaire Collective because it’s been a nightmare. I bought a Celine bag from them last month, and when it arrived, it was clearly fake. The hardware, stitching, and overall quality were nothing like an authentic Celine. I immediately contacted them, thinking they’d handle it professionally, but nope.

They “re-authenticated” it and still claimed it was real. When I pointed out all the issues, they just kept repeating the same copy-paste responses and refused to provide any real explanation of their authentication process. They even told me I should take it to Celine myself, which isn’t even possible because Celine (like most luxury brands) doesn’t authenticate secondhand items. I even contacted my local Celine and confirmed this, which I shared with VC. They completely ignored this fact and kept shifting the blame on me.

At this point, I’ve escalated the case to Klarna and the BBB, but VC is still refusing to do anything. I’ve seen other people have similar issues with them, so just a warning to be careful if you ever consider buying from them.

Has anyone else dealt with this? If so, were you able to get your money back?

Edit: I forgot to mention that I compared the bag upon receiving it to the exact same Celine bag in a different color I bought straight from Celine. I sent Vestiaire plenty of side by side pictures that showed a huge difference I quality/size/structure, which they never once acknowledged or addressed. ",2025-04-04 13:19:02+00:00,303,91

Lately I’ve been carrying a Quince Italian Suede shoulder bag in Emerald that I actually love and it was only $120.00. 

But the Vela….. unforgettable. I saw it on a grey market site for $900.00 and bought it. 

They would not take my debit so I had to put it on our shared credit card. 

How do I explain another bag to my husband? My life is mostly doctors appointments. 

Why do I do this? I should turn my Internet off at night! 😆 I’ll be sure to post it when it arrives. I love unusual bags. 

Along the same lines, What is a good online way to sell old bags? I have an LV wallet I’ve never used, same with sunglasses that are too big for me (and which I saw on Emily in Paris). I also have a telfar bag that I never even opened. They are tacky and I don’t know why I bought it. All are unused so I would like to get most of my money back. Are there Facebook groups or should I do Poshmark? I know that TRR and the others will only give me a fraction of what I hope. 

To be clear, we can afford the bag but I feel guilty because my life is mostly a homebody these days. It’s my birthday this week so maybe I’ll explain I gave myself a present? It’s like a bag gets in my head and I ignore it for months, knowing it’s not for me-then the dam breaks!!

1jr52vk,handbags,Recommendations for a work bag/tote,"I currently have a White Elm Gemini bag and while I do really like it, there’s parts of it I don’t. I am not a very careful bag owner so it is already getting some tearing at the base of the handles and scuff marks etc. it is also pretty heavy even when it is empty, which isn’t a huge deal breaker but I do think it’s the material that makes it this way. I have looked at their nylon versions but I feel like that’s expensive for a nylon bag…

I need something not over $200, preferably a material that can last longer or at minimum a bag that can hold up to someone who just kind of puts their bag wherever. I need it to fit a 15” laptop and like having space for a notebook, pens and mouse. 

I have been looking at poppy’s and peonies daily tote but it’s sold out currently and I don’t know if it’s worth waiting till June when the bag I am using is just getting tore up. ",2025-04-04 06:11:00+00:00,2,5

1jr1yq5,handbags,Opinion Needed on Fossil Tote Bag,"Hi all, i am considering between Fossil Sydney Tote Bag and Fossil Kyler Tote Bag.

I personally favour the look of Sydney over Kyler but I am a little concerned with the handle / strap because it's not adjustable. On the other hand, Kyler would give me a little more flexibility due to the detachable shoulder strap, so I could either use it as a shoulder bag or handbag. 

I have never used a work tote bag before (currently using a backpack) so I am not sure how important is the flexibility of using the tote bag as a shoulder / hang bag in choosing a work tote bag. It would be really helpful if anyone could give me some opinions based on your experience :)

Also welcome if you have any other opinions regarding either of them based on your personal experience so that I can make a more informed decision. Thanks!

I’ll be visiting New York City soon (for a week), and I’d love to buy a beautiful bag while I’m there—but nothing too expensive. I’d say my budget is around 300 euros (about the same in USD). I’ve been looking at Kate Spade and COACH (some bags I like: Hadley, Rowan Large, City Tote Bag, Andrea Carryall), partly because they’re brands originally from New York.

I’m from the Netherlands, and even at outlet stores here, the prices are much higher. I noticed that there aren’t any outlet locations in NYC itself. My question is: would you recommend ordering a bag from the COACH outlet website and having it delivered to a pickup point in NYC (I have no experience with this in the U.S.), or should I just visit a store and find one there?

Also, if you have any other suggestions for bags, brands, or stores, I’d love to hear them!

1jqd07l,handbags,Need 15 inch laptop shoulder tote that zips!,"Hi all, I’m looking for a nice dressy leather shoulder tote that is large enough to hold a 15 inch laptop and zips across the top. I either find ones that are too small, made out of nylon and look too casual, don’t stand up on their own, don’t have shoulder straps, or don’t zip across the top. 

I travel to a few conferences a year and want to have something that looks dressy with the rest of my professional outfit and that fully zips so that when I travel on the plane nothing falls out of it. 

I need room for the 15 inch laptop (does not need a special padded sleeve, just large enough to accommodate 14.5 inches wide and 10.5 inches tall), one or two full-size standard notebooks, and a handful of accessories like pens, a phone charger, Post-it notes, presentation clicker, and my business card holder. Bonus points for interior pockets, but I could deal with an exterior pocket that holds smaller items as long as it also zips. 

I feel like I’m Goldilocks and I can’t find a nice dressy bag that holds a larger computer. I tried ordering some off of Amazon, I tried looking at coach and coach outlet, I tried at Nordstrom, and even looked around a lot online and still can’t find one that fits those specs.

I’ve decided I would like to upgrade from my typical grocery-branded, folding plastic bag to Le Pliage. The repair service is a huge plus and the aesthetic is nice. I am debating between the classic L, the expandable travel bag and the L in the longer, shopper shape.

Here’s how I would use it:

It will be folded up in another bag every day (work or sports bag). I live in a big city and don’t have a car, so this bag will be on the back of my bike when it’s full. It will mostly be for groceries. I cook a lot and buy groceries every other day. Due to excessive food packaging, I need the L size. It also rains here often, so the zipper is essential. I would like all use it for picnics, sauna and swimming, though I don’t know if the bag will get destroyed by putting wet towels in it.

The shoulder carry is useful, but not required as it would take up more space in my main bag that way and it will be in my bike basket when full. 

I look forward to hearing your opinions and thanks for reading.

I worked my butt off for a bonus at work, and want to treat myself to a good, designer bag. I have narrowed it down to a few but can't choose. 

I should preface this that I am not a bag or shoe girl. My style is a bit androgynous and utilitarian but with flair (think Indiana Jones meets 70s George Harrison, with an undercurrent of Cher)

I only carry bags when it's too warm for a pocketed jacket. My must-haves are: zipper closure, shoulder wearable, and large enough for my 6x9 notebook. It would be a daily driver, but I don't care if it gets beat up. 

My wardrobe consists of earthtones - greens, browns, and denim. 

Now - I am thinking of either:
- The smallish shoulder carry miu miu Aventure;

- The Prada Aimee in caramel

- Large Prada Galleria in caramel

- Secondhand Hermes Bolide 35 in chocolate brown

I have a north South sac du jour tote, but don't reach for it because it won't zip. I have a Celine trio in burgundy, but it doesn't fit my notebook. I have a vintage BV Campana hobo in dark brown that I don't wear because I'm afraid I will ruin it (and it doesn't zip). I have a forest green color Saint Laurent Fermoir that is my ""baby"".

For example, I’m interested in a Prada bag that costs $2,700. I know that there will be a 20% tariff to import goods from the EU and that will trickle down to the consumers and thus we’ll see some price increases. Does anyone know if we’ll see price increases overnight essentially or if it’ll take time to see it? Only asking because I have my eye on this bag and idk if I should buy it tonight or if I have a bit of time until the increases happen.  

* Edit: I’m not looking for financial advice, I can afford it and have the cash. My birthday is in about a month and was looking to purchase it between now and then anyways.

I had looked at the bag in Tokyo in January but couldn’t bring myself to take the plunge. Reading previous threads on this sub and Google reviews about waiting hours in line at Goyard in Paris scared me because I was on a layover and also wanted to see a friend in the city. I ended up going to the boutique in Printemps since it seems the least “popular” but was scared they wouldn’t have stock. I ended up waiting only 10 ish minutes (maybe because I went on a Monday?) and they had the Artois in all colors except the navy blue!

1jpxdxx,handbags,Strathberry sale haul,"I've always been curious about this brand so the sale seemed like a perfect time to indulge in a few pieces. 

I picked up the Lana hobo in chocolate suede, the Mini tote in oxblood and the Stylist in Vanilla, plus a cute crescent card holder because my current one I've been using for years is on its last legs. I have to say my favorite is probably the Stylist because of the pony hair texture detailing and its ability to be a great bag for summer events or just casual evenings out. It's quite roomy and I don't own anything remotely white/vanilla so I'm hoping I can keep this clean!

I have to say the leather feels really nice, but I also think the workmanship and some details (glazing and stitches) are kind of what you expect at this price point. For example, the strap that holds the locking hardware of the mini tote isn't lined up exactly where I think it should be, so it pulls a little to the right. Not a huge problem and doesn't interfere with the functionality so I'm willing to overlook it. 

Overall I'm pretty happy with what I purchased, but probably wouldn't pay full price. ",2025-04-02 19:25:56+00:00,30,10
1jpxd6v,handbags,My Full Designer Handbag Collection – 16 Bags,"Here’s a look at my full designer handbag collection, including a few SLGs I’ve added over time. I started collecting at 16, and this journey has been so special to me, watching my collection grow and evolve. Many of these bags represent milestones and personal achievements, and I’ve carefully curated them over the years. I previously posted most of my Chanel collection under my old Reddit account (/goodaddictions), but I got locked out, so I’m excited to share everything again here!

Here’s what’s in my collection, listed in the order I acquired them:
	•	Gucci Marmont (Velvet Teal)
	•	Celine Luggage Tote
	•	Louis Vuitton Escale Double Zip Pouch
	•	Louis Vuitton Vanity PM
	•	Chanel Classic Flap (Black, Medium)
	•	Dior Mini Lady (White)
	•	Chanel Vanity (Blue)
	•	Chanel Clutch on Chain (Green)
	•	Chanel Coco Handle (White)
	•	Dior Large Book Tote
	•	YSL Wallet on Chain (Black)
	•	Chanel Classic Flap (Small, Periwinkle)
	•	Gucci Backpack
	•	Chanel Wallet on Chain (Purple)
	•	Hermes Birkin 30 (Malachite)

As you can see, my collection spans several iconic brands and a mix of styles. From my first Gucci bag to the coveted Hermes Birkin, each piece has a story and holds a special place in my heart. I love how each bag complements different phases of my life, from more casual bags like the Gucci Marmont to the elegant and timeless Chanel pieces.",2025-04-02 19:25:06+00:00,487,60

I bought my first ever designer handbag 2 years ago, a Gucci Diana small tote in white. I love her so much but she’s not really an every day bag. I’m now looking for a bag that I can wear semi-casually during the day, but also dress up and wear for a night out/nice dinner/etc. Initially went to go look at the YSL sac de jour nano in black croc (obsessed), but then I walked by the new burgundy small Gucci Jackie and it literally stopped me in my tracks. It was so gorgeous and now I can’t decide! I’m wondering if I shouldn’t buy another Gucci because I already have the Diana? (I also bought a blue Dionysus secondhand last year, so that would be 3 Gucci’s now). Worth noting that the Gucci is about $1000 more expensive than then YSL.",2025-04-02 15:29:51+00:00,5,7

1jpokfn,handbags,Help me find a work bag pls,"Hi Everyone,

As the title says I need some help. 
I think I need a unicorn. 
My employer has bought me a brand new laptop (which is great as my current one is on the verge of collapse). Unfortunately I’ve just realised it is massive. 
My current laptop is small and light, this one is 16” and a bit heavier.

So I’m on the hunt for a work bag that’s still stylish, that will fit this behemoth. I think ideally I’d like a convertible leather tote. Something that is truly convertible - like move the straps and now it’s a backpack, not just a side bag. I want a high end look, but since it’s work and likely a backpack don’t want to spend too much, thinking under $300aud. 
Is this still possible or am I dreaming?

Looking for suggestions, show me what you think will work.

Thanks!

1jpluzw,handbags,Spring/summer bags that look fine in fall/winter too?,"Hi! This is my first post on Reddit, so please tell me if I'm doing something wrong. :)

I am feeling all those spring feelings 🌸 and would love to gift myself a spring/summer bag. However, where I live winter is quite cold and lasts basically half a year, and I am taking this into consideration when choosing my next purchase. I would like a bag that is light and colorful enough for spring/summer, but that I can sometimes also use the rest of the year without it looking totally out of place. For example, I love the Staud bead bags, but I never pull the trigger because I get the feeling I would use them very rarely. I know that's not an issue per se, bus as I'm just starting to build my bag collection I prefer choosing something I can use often. 

Do you have any suggestions for bags that I could check? I like boxy bags, while I struggle with slouchy silhouettes. My budget is max 500/600 eur. I'm thinking about the A.P.C. Grace small in this gorgeous baby blue - what do you think about it? Any other option that comes to mind? I am also planning on buying the Margesherwood Boston bag in September, and that will most likely be in brown, so I would like a little pop of color with this spring/summer bag. 

Thanks for any tips you'll send! And thanks for keeping such an uplifting atmosphere in this sub, I've been lurking for a while and love it ❤️

2. [balenciaga le cagole small](https://cdn.clothbase.com/uploads/95736cc2-a8dd-479f-948c-e36495e54f03/P00596896_b1.jpg), ideal small shoulder bag, i think is beautiful and what i love about this line of bags is the amount of details in them

3. [mm6 maison margiela tote bag](https://img01.ztat.net/article/spp-media-p1/90c0bb038ca949d293dd3fc451d5871d/d9e4d5399dbe418e8c050e8e2ed51f88.jpg?imwidth=762), i like the size but this color way is nowhere to be found online, the key holder and side sleeve is a very nice touch!

4. [miu miu pocket bag](https://www.ln-cc.com/dw/image/v2/BGDG_PRD/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-09/default/dw86e3b2f5/images/zoom/miu0256022_bei_04.jpg?sw=375&sh=516), cute but is too small for my liking, but I love the outside pockets and how thin/light it looks to be

5. dkny paula commuter bag, LOVE and was so close to getting this but nothing about it is leather :(

in conclusion, i'd want a purse bag that I could wear on my shoulder (not a fan at all of the small handbag handle + long crossbody strap combo), something small but still big enough to wear for my every day carry but not huge either. 

would appreciate any recs, my limit is 1500 i'd say but feel free to drop any choices, and I'm not strict on wanting a designer brand haha these are just my ideal top choices
