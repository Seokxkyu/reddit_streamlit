1k5zko2,PoloRalphLauren,15 Year Old Lo-Life Collection,"I started collecting and buying Polo Ralph Lauren clothes less than a year ago. Everything you see in the pictures was bought throughout this past year. My parents didn’t give me money specifically for clothes — just some money for holidays or to buy food at school, which I saved up to buy clothing. I also made around $400 just from selling on Vinted. Almost all the clothes were bought on Vinted, except for the jackets, which I got from eBay and Grailed.

I also have clothes from Carhartt, Dickies, Nike, Rocawear, Sean John, Nautica, and Tommy Hilfiger, but Polo Ralph Lauren is the brand i most like.

I’m from Romania, where it’s pretty difficult to find Polo Ralph Lauren items, so you really have to search hard. If you have any questions, or if you have an idea of how much this collection might be worth — or whether it’s a good collection for a 15-year-old — feel free to let me know.",2025-04-23 13:46:24+00:00,89,12
1k5o7c6,PoloRalphLauren,RETURN CANCELLED - HELP,"Anyone ever have to deal with something similar to this?
Ordered my initial order(my account)
Ordered more clothes the next day on my wifes account (wofes account)
Then a few days later my wife thought her order hadnt beenn received sl she reached and got a replacement confirmation 

When I found out about her replacement i urgently expressed to her that I had moved her package and she realized it didnt need replacing.
So we reached out to ralph lauren and canceled the replacement. ( When we called, we realized that the replacement being sent was actually of corresponding to my order and not her order - meaning she would have gotten a package delivered of the stuff that I ordered on my account)

It just so happened that the event I needed my clothing for that.I ordered on my account was canceled.Therefore I returned that order i placed first abd on my own.
Ralph lauren has allowed me to return it for gift receipt so I uploaded my son's email address for that.

Its been 2 weeks and i message chat support in frequently, but enough to get some updates

I have gotten a email confirmation that my package of my returned goods was received.
But then today, when I was asking support for status of my return, they told me that they have no history of a return and they had no idea what I was talking about, they said it had been canceled. And I have to now, wait five days for the claim submitted to even get an email response .... wtf",2025-04-23 02:18:14+00:00,0,12

1k2s4ca,PoloRalphLauren,[Sizing Help] The Iconic Mesh Polo Shirt (Boys 8–20) – Should I Go with XL?,"Hey everyone,

I’m looking to buy The Iconic Mesh Polo Shirt (Boys 8–20) and considering the XL size, but I’m not totally sure if it’ll fit me properly.

For reference:

Male

5’5” (165 cm)

60 kg

Ectomorph body type

Based in the Southeast Asia (so returns = pain)

I was drawn to it because it’s way cheaper than the adult sizes and I guess being short has its perks… like saving money by shopping in the kids’ section 😂

If anyone’s bought from this line before, how’s the sizing? Does XL run small or true to size? Would love to hear your thoughts before I hit “checkout.”

I would really appreciate the help, since this would be my first buy with my own money. Thanks in advance!",2025-04-19 09:04:37+00:00,1,0

I’m Gitika, a grad student at SCAD (Savannah College of Art and Design), currently working on my master’s thesis in Luxury and Brand Management. My project is titled **“Beyond the Polo: How Purple Label Can Elevate Ralph Lauren’s Luxury Perception”**, and I’m diving into how fans, customers, and fashion lovers view the brand—especially its most premium line, Purple Label.

If you’ve ever bought, admired, or even just browsed Ralph Lauren (any line!), I’d love for you to take **2–3 minutes** to fill out this quick anonymous survey:  
👉 [https://forms.gle/qgMvgpPo3muucxzc9](https://forms.gle/qgMvgpPo3muucxzc9)

Your thoughts will be incredibly helpful in understanding how people perceive Ralph Lauren today—especially from a luxury and storytelling point of view.

Thank you so much in advance! And of course, I’m happy to share my findings here if anyone’s interested once I’m done!

I was wondering what is the difference between these two Alston penny loafers. They are from two renown distributors pledging to be authentic and certified, but the models vary by a lot (especially the logo on the side caught my eye). Are they produced by different sub-companies? And is there any quality difference between them?

1jczjb5,PoloRalphLauren,Question for Canadians,"Hi, I’m considering making a big-ish order on ralphlauren.ca - seeing as they ship from the states using UPS, I’m worried about being charged additional taxes/duties and brokerage fees. 

Any Canadians who have ordered from the site - do you mind sharing the value ($) of your order and how much you ended up having to pay in duties/brokerage fees?

Also not sure how the tariff situation will play into this - anyone know if consumers are automatically being dinged an extra 25% on their orders coming in from the US?",2025-03-17 00:00:24+00:00,2,2

I love wearing the men’s tshirts and ball caps. 



I have been a fan of POLO since 1986. I began dressing for comfort when I was pregnant with my daughter and just stuck with it.


I went to Macys today and found the long sleeve polo beat T-shirt with the ball caps to match. 

I went to Marshalls and found a short sleeve POLO tshirt and this ball cap matches perfectly with it.

I mostly buy the POLO bear clothes because they look so cute and add femininity to my wardrobe.

As someone who is born and raised in LA, this tragedy has affected me deeply, and I want to do my personal part to help out, with this being an immediate response. With the earnings from these auctions, I will distribute the monies throughout multiple GoFundMe pages of those personally affect, as there are many people in my immediate circle, as well as people of note. If you have a person you would like the money to go directly towards, I can help make that possible. Most items are from '02 - '15, with a couple of exceptions. Thanks for reading, and thanks in advance for checking out the listings, and let fellow collectors know. It's not the typical grail pieces, but there might be something you didn't know you needed.

This is a heavy weight part linen part cotton collared toggle cardigan that is substantial enough (it's heavy!) to wear as a light sweater coat.  The elbow patches and interesting stitching on the pockets and cuffs really elevate the look and feel.  Does anyone know when it was introduced into the RL collection?  Also appreciative on insights into value.

Hey everyone, I’ve been looking at a Ralph Lauren jacket on DHgate, and honestly, it looks pretty legit in the photos. The tags, stitching, and overall design seem spot on, and the price is way lower than retail. I’ve heard that sometimes these sellers have access to overstock or factory extras.

Has anyone here bought a Ralph Lauren jacket from DHgate before? Was it authentic, or at least close in quality? Also, how’s the sizing—should I stick to my usual size or size up/down?

Would love to hear your experiences before I pull the trigger. Thanks in advance!

I’m getting older and starting to want to dress more mature and have fallen in love with Polo Ralph Lauren. I’m not completely new to polo, I did have 1 traditional polo shirt and made the switch to polo boxer briefs about 7 months ago (best thing ever) but I’m still learning. These recent pickups are for Christmas. I’ve decided to dress nice for my family gatherings this year and I have 3 to go to. I grabbed a couple extra things to have options and maybe use the short sleeves in the spring/summer.

Bonus pic is my polo fragrance collection. I have had polo black for years and have added the others recently. I call this my polo section because I have a decent amount of other fragrances 😂

1hahery,PoloRalphLauren,Classic white polo falling apart when barely worn.,"I bought this classic white polo this summer and there already started to become holes in the armpits the 3rd or 4rth time I wore it. Wierd stains also appeared in the armpits AFTER laundy as if some chemical reaction happened. I wear deoderant that doesen't stain and haven't had any issues with any other white shirts/clothing. Somehow this polo manages to look like nuclear waste from chernobyl when barely worn with it's somehow blue and yellow stains. I have used the shirt maybe a total of 20 or so times and it looks to be multiple years old. I know this looks nasty af but understand this is not how any other piece of clothing I own look like. I have legit checked it to the best of my ability and it seems legit. I also bought it from a reputable store.

I ordered it online along with two cable-knit sweaters, but they sent me three cable-knit sweaters instead of the pullover.

They haven't helped me get the correct item and are asking me to handle the return process for the wrong item they sent. They're also not assisting me in placing a new order for the pullover and have told me to reorder it once it restocks. Does that make sense to you?

Additionally, they advised me to wait until they receive the returned item before they issue a refund. They said they will not refund me until the wrong item is returned, and they won't recommend me to reorder the correct item until then.

Is this common for RL to handle things this way?

I'm not a guy who wears cropped tshirts but it did seem quite unusual that the tops I have tried all go past my seat and touch my upper hamstrings.
The only other brand that I've seen also have this odd sizing is Carhartt, again with their sweaters, tshirts and work vests.
Does anyone know why Ralph Lauren sizing is so weird and has anyone else also run into this issue?
Tips and advice would be appreciated, thanks. 

For reference, I am 5'9ish, 185 stocky build and I have been going with a size Large so far, though when trying a Medium I also run into the same issue.

I have attached photos the pony embroidery and neck labels. I will attach the photos of the polos on the comments so that you can see why im questioning the authenticity of the shirts now. I’ve owned some plaid polo button ups but the tags on mine don’t look the same, the “custom fit” label especially catches my attention.

I’ve bought but two this past year and the quality is very poor for Polo Ralph Lauren, especially the labels. The green polo I received as a gift actually has a crease on the label from where it was sewn on too loose and on both my green one and my black one the slim fit label is sewn on very messily. 

The pony is also not as high quality as it used to be, it just seems very thin and just missing a lot of shape. The last photo is the red polo is a second hand one from around 2012 and you can see that the label is a lot higher quality and sewn on with more care. ",2024-11-08 12:35:17+00:00,4,12

Hey guys, my father bought a Ralph Lauren purple label parka a few years ago but due his old age he finds it difficult to wear the coat without complaining about its weight. He did buy it for his 60th as an upgrade on his old skiing jacket. Unfortunately, the coat has been sat in his wardrobe for a good while, unworn for a good while and he’s instructed me to see if anyone else would like it. He’s reluctant to let go of it due to it being so pricey but is prepared to do so.

I am writing this to ask is there any suitable places to sell such a coat? I’ve tried the usual places online but I don’t feel the buyers have spoken to really appreciate the coat considering it’s in amazing condition and has no faults whatsoever! Id appreciate if anyone could point me in the right direction! 

Thanks in advance xx
