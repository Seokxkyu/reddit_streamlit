Unless you're on the cusp of a prestige victory, I can't see this as being anything but an absolutely terrible deal.

1ju2i8r,u_Some-Ingenuity-7423,I need help finding the name of these BL novels,"Hello, could you help me? I can't find the name of these BL novels.  

Both are Chinese novels, in the first one, the protagonist is a student who treats his roommate as a rival, one day he receives the news that his grandfather is going to die, before he dies, His grandfather passes on to the protagonist the gift of seeing and talking to ghosts, this power only disappears when the protagonist touches his roommate, from then on they develop the romance. 

Now the second novel, the protagonist wakes up in someone else's body in the future, literally in another galaxy, there he discovers that his stepmother contributed to the death of the body he is in now. He discovers that he is engaged to a general who everyone says is ugly and a horrible person, but he decides to marry him to get away from the house where he is, he meets the general and it's not like they told him, the general is handsome and very different from the rumors, he discovers that this general has a mission on another planet that was actually Earth, He quickly decides to marry the general so he can go to Earth, which is very different from how it was in the past. We discover during the reading that the protagonist has the gift of summoning and talk to ghosts, something like a shaman, he helps save the general's friend, and it also shows that the dead soldiers still fought after death as ghosts, he offers incense, houses, various things and ends up gaining the trust, respect and even envy of others, but the general (his husband) always protects him, the name of the novel has something to do with ""collecting flowers""

System: MgT2e
Style: Episodic Jobs + Overarching Mystery
Themes: Gritty Sci-Fi, Criminal Underworld, Morality, High-Stakes Hunts
Sessions: Bi-weekly TBA

The Hunt Begins…
The galaxy is lawless. Justice is just another word for whoever’s paying. That’s where you come in.You and your crew are bounty hunters—picking up jobs from crime lords, corporate suits, and desperate clients with too many credits and not enough sense. One day, you’re tracking down a rogue AI in the slums of a rusted-out orbital station. The next, you’re kicking in the doors of a smuggler’s hideout, weapons hot.

The Guild: The Independent Resolution Collective (IRC)
You’re not just freelancers; you’re part of the IRC, a democratic bounty hunter guild that provides resources, intel, and legal cover—so long as you follow the code. Need a tip on a high-value mark? The network has you covered. Legal trouble after a messy job? The guild might foot the bill. But step out of line, and you’ll answer to a jury of your peers. The IRC plays by its own rules, balancing professionalism, and pragmatism—though where you draw the line is up to you.


The Job Details:
Every mission is a multi-session adventure: tracking marks across backwater colonies, infiltrating corporate strongholds, dogfighting in asteroid belts. But with each job, a deeper mystery unfolds—one that ties back to you and your crew in ways you never expected.
Do you have what it takes to bring ‘em in warm... or cold?

1ju26pc,androidapps,Looking for an Airdroid counterpart that sends MMS,"I have a Mac - well, two, an iMac and and Air - and a Galaxy S22+. All have Airdroid, which for the most part satisfies my needs. 

The bit that drives me batty is Airdroid's inability to send MMS texts to my computer, and vice versa. A text-only conversation with one person, no problem - I can receive and respond to the message on my computer. 

A conversation with multiple parties? Nope. Pictures, videos? Nope. I don't even get the text that accompanied the media in the message.

I'm not much of a tech person; maybe there's some perfectly reasonable explanation for why it can't handle it? More importantly: what other app would do this? Has to be cross-platform, obviously, and I'm willing to pay for the right app. 

Any info you can share? Thanks!",2025-04-08 01:42:10+00:00,2,0

1ju24a0,remoteplay,Ok before I buy ANOTHER Controller - What works Well with Galaxy S25 Ultra Keeping in a case?,"Ok so here is what I am dealing with here.  I have a Playstation 5 console and I want to play locally in my house with my phone and a android based bluetooth controller.  I have already tried one that did not work with PS Remote play then I tried the Gamesir Galileo G8 and that issue is that it needs to connect with USB and I do not want to take my phone case off or it creates a problem with the finger print reader on the screen with the case, just inconvenient.  Any other ideas on what I can use here? Backbone uses USB-C for Playstation NOT going to work for me.  I need a Bluetooth controller.  Thanks for the help in advance.",2025-04-08 01:38:36+00:00,1,0

If not, does anyone know an emulator I can use to play any of the pokemon games, whether it's 3ds or ds or gameboy color isn't important as long as it can run online multiplayer.

1ju1z6c,LoveAndDeepspace,Caleb Ethereal *Remastered* : Sets 1-11,"Hello everyone!

Since I’m using a third party app (Hypic) to post-process my photos now, I figured I would edit one favorite photo from each of my Caleb Ethereal sets I’ve posted here. Zoom in to see the quality!

.
- Set 1: O Boy With Sunset Eyes

- Set 2: Strawberry-Banana Flavored (New angle!)

- Set 3: Sunrise Cheeto Fingers (New angle!)

- Set 4: Poolside Spectator

- Set 5: Brush Fire in Azure Garden (New angle!)

- Set 6: Sunset Eyes’ Roses

- Set 7: Intimate Eye Exam

- Set 8: Fallen Angel

- Set 9: One Cool, One Warm (Hands hands hands!)

- Set 10: Cosmic Confidant

- Set 10.6: Rain in a Galaxy Far Far Away

- Set 11: Endless Summer
.

I don’t expect myself to post any more regular Caleb Ethereal. Instead the series will be called Caleb Ethereal *HD*, as some of you have already seen. This pattern will follow for any LI I post photos of moving forward.
.

My goal is to post as high quality photos as possible, with the most creativity I can come up with, whether through lighting, poses, angles, editing etc. These series are really about appreciating the beauty of the LIs, as well as sharing my intimate moments with them. I spend hours on each of these sets, and I love every minute of it.
.

Thank you to everyone who recognizes the series and has shown their love in the comments! It makes me so happy to see others love the photos like I do. 🥰 Which set is your favorite?? I think mine has to be Sunrise Cheeto Fingers lol especially with this new photo. I want to do more flavor sets! 😋🤭
.

Hopefully the formatting isn’t too bad— I’ve been struggling with it on mobile.

1ju1ro4,Stellaris,The Birth of a Purity Assembly,"They say our world used to have a sky. 

It was blue, with white clouds and orange sunsets. The skies weren’t sickly gray and black, choking with the ashes of a funeral pyre that burned out two hundred years ago. The rain was a lifegiving downpour of potable water, not a corrosive acid that melts flesh to a sludge draining into murky black lakes. The waters were blue, teaming with life and a source of food for billions, now they bring only death. Snow was white, pure and soft and gleaming, although it probably didn’t glow at night. Our ancestors say that at night, when the clouds parted in the sky, you could look up and see the stars. I never believed such an idea, that the clouds could ever part. 

The skies were still filled with birds back then, that much is the same. Just with fewer teeth. 

They say that storytellers of the old world would spin tales of monsters in the dark, creatures of the night that take children who misbehave or disrespect their parents. These were, of course, fictions told by parents to inspire the imagination, nothing more. Not anymore.

A child in our world who does not fear the dark is consumed by it. Radiation, the Forced Mutation Virus, and old-world bio-warfare twisted nature beyond recognition. What took a billion years to evolve was corrupted in a handful of decades. Our ancestors emerged from their bunkers at the bottom of the food chain, and we had to fight to earn our right to survive. The beasts that lurked in the night were only surpassed in terror by the beasts that ruled in the day. 

And beyond the beasts, were the most dangerous foes of all. The things that can think. Those that can speak. The child’s voice calling out for help in the forest, the hand in the water of a bog reaching for help, the unkindly thing pleading  for its life in a young woman’s voice while it cries crocodile tears from a dozen pitch-black eyes. The others that look so much like us but twisted into disgusting forms beyond any words to describe, and beyond any mind to imagine. We are good natured people at heart, not unfeeling monsters such as those we stood against. We had to learn to harden ourselves against suicidal empathy, and to embrace pragmatic compassion. For every dozen creatures that begged for its wretched life, one was still sane enough to thank us for a merciful death. We are a merciful people. 

The old world was ruled by fools and tyrants. The people squandered their suffrage and outsourced their safety to corrupt politicians serving no interest other than their own. Their error was surpassed only by the communalists who surrendered their freedom entirely to those who would command them as if the individual were no more than a resource for the collective whole. It was not heroic leaders and egotistical tyrants who rebuilt civilization. Our world was purified of corruption by citizen militias and the workers they protected from the mutant. 

The officer commands with the consent of the enlisted, and politicians rule with the consent of the governed. Citizenship is a privilege and a duty that must be claimed through service, and maintained through civic responsibility. The people purified our world, and the people will guide our species to glory among the stars. 

As we searched beyond our dead world for our new manifest destiny, we learned that even the galaxy is not free from corruption. We found more others, more things, more twisted mockeries of sapient life infesting what is rightfully ours. They attempted to confuse and corrupt our minds with words we never bother to translate, sullying new homes that are ours by right with their miserable, twisted excuses for lives. 

We are a merciful people, and we come to grant the final mercy to all things that lurk in the dark.

B5550m c mobo

Am4 ryzen 5 5600

Moving from Radeon RX 5600xt to a Radeon RX 7900 XT

Moving from an apevia 600w to a Apevia galaxy 1000watt psu (upgraded the day after my problem started)

4x ram sticks = to 40~ of ram



I Just recently bought a 7900xt MERC and since attempting to install it my pc completely shit itself

My pc now displays the red cpu and the dram light. I resat the cpu 3 times and all ram mulitple times and tried with 1 through 4 ram sticks at a time. If the cpu isnt plugged in the pc will start but has trouble starting when it is plugged in.

It does this thing where if i hold the reset and power button at the same time it will turn on with no display i feel like ive tried everything at this point.

Btw im not super experienced with pc builds this one was a prebuild that i was going to slowly upgrade to be better.

I sent the guy some money to hold it until I can get there to look at it tomorrow after work. It’ll run with some gas in the carb bowl but I’m not sure about the status of the transmission or which one it is. The seller says he’s a Chevy guy and acquired the Galaxie in trade for a Chevelle he got and doesn’t know much about Fords. I guess I’m more or less asking what my odds are of getting the car then finding out it has transmission problems? I’m a car guy so I know all about how a car can be ruined by the driver so it’s hard to tell. Just trying to gauge where I possibly stand because the transmission is going to be my only unknown going into this.

1ju1a2v,audible,Seeking Immersive Books with Serious Narration and Complex/Dark Themes,"I'm on the hunt for some compelling book recommendations

Here’s what I’ve listened to and enjoyed so far:

* *Dune*
* *Dune Messiah*
* *Animal Farm*
* *Everything is F\*\*ked*
* *Ikigai*
* *Poor Things*

I attempted *Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy*, but the whimsical narration didn't resonate with me.

I'm particularly interested in stories that feature:

* **A serious tone/narration**
* **Dense and immersive world-building**
* **Complex, layered characters**
* **Darker or more depressing themes** (e.g., emotional depth, moral ambiguity, existential dread)

I'm open to exploring any genre—sci-fi, fantasy, literary fiction, dystopian, psychological—as long as it aligns with the above criteria.

I was keen on listening to *The First Law* trilogy by Joe Abercrombie, but unfortunately, it's not available on Audible India.",2025-04-08 00:55:33+00:00,1,7
1ju19d1,Switch,Super Mario 3D All-Stars: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition (And 3D World),"So, with the Nintendo Switch 2 getting upgraded versions of games, and with it being Mario's 40th Anniversary this year, what if now is the time to bring back Super Mario 3D All-Stars? It would of course include upgraded graphics, frame rate, etc., but it could also fix the game's two biggest issues with an upgrade, those being (A) its temporary availability, as now it could be available permanently, and (B) its lack of Super Mario Galaxy 2. The upgrade would be priced at $20 like Kirby and Jamboree's upgrades (I think?), which makes sense and would honestly be worth it.

Similarly for 3D Land, maybe it could come in a Switch 2 version of 3D World, also for $20 and maybe even with multiplayer support. Just imagine how amazing the title, ""Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Super Mario 3D Land"" would be.

This would get all mainline 3D Mario Games playable on Switch and be a decent celebration of Mario's 40th, especially if Donkey Kong Bananza rules out a new 3D Mario this year (which it doesn't necessarily, but if there isn't new Mario than this is a decent compromise for now.)

Let me know what you think of these as legitimate possibilities!

(EDIT: I just realized 3D World is getting a free update already, so that probably means no Switch 2 Edition, but 3D All-Stars is still on the table. I'm leaving the 3D World part in here because its still a funny name.)",2025-04-08 00:54:32+00:00,0,0

1ju16l7,Christianity,Biblical Christian Designarism: Truth told in Tale,"Prologue: The Puzzle Beneath the Surface

Long before I wrestled with Genesis, I wrestled with logic.

Not the application of it—I’d used logic for years. I trusted it, deployed it, leaned on it in debates and diagnostics. But eventually, I started asking what should’ve been an obvious question: Why does logic hold at all? Why are its laws timeless, universal, inescapable? Where do they live?

Most people don’t stop to ask. They treat logic like air—always assumed, rarely examined. But once you begin pulling that thread, you realize something unnerving: materialism has no real explanation for why logic works. It uses it constantly. It depends on it. But it can’t tell you what logic is, or how immaterial laws exist in a system supposedly governed by matter and energy alone.

That tension cracked open something in me.

It wasn’t emotion that led me to reexamine the foundations. It wasn’t pressure from the pulpit. It was something more basic—something architectural. The pillars that held up the prevailing story of the world weren’t grounded. They floated. The laws of logic, the structure of mathematics, the existence of information—they all pointed to something higher, something prior.

Not just a Creator. A Mind.

A Mind that didn’t emerge from matter but preceded it. A Mind whose nature gives rise to the very laws by which we reason. A Mind whose speech calls out not only stars and galaxies, but truth itself.

That realization wasn’t the end of doubt—it was the beginning of reassembly.

From there, the pieces began to shift. I started looking at reality not as an accident or a collision of probabilities, but as a system—an orchestrated architecture where every layer obeys the logic of the One who spoke it into being. And the more I examined the Genesis account, the more I saw not ancient poetry, but structured deployment—a system boot sequence written in terms both physical and purposeful.

That’s where Biblical Christian Designarism was born—not as a reaction to science, but as an affirmation that science only makes sense in a world designed to be known. A world where logic isn’t optional. Where information doesn’t just happen. Where matter is downstream from meaning.

And where the Logos—the eternal Word—isn’t just the origin of it all, but the one who steps into it to redeem what’s broken.

Which isn’t true. Anyone who uses Saitama winning for the reasons of Gag/Parody Character, Hasn’t Lost yet, or Made to Win, as reasoning will get striked with Rule 6. Go based on his current feats. 

For example and this isn’t true. If Saitama scales to Planetary with no diff, than he should be able to take attacks higher but not massively higher than planetary like Galaxy level would be a huge stretch.

This allows more production conversion and not the same thing other subs do when the Caped Baldy is involved ",2025-04-08 00:37:39+00:00,16,29
1ju0ti3,Stellaris,I broke the AI,"I really did break this AI. I’m playing with ACOT and Giga, and I’ve progressed so far ahead of the galaxy that nothing can stop me. 

I built the Dyson beam and use it to take out key systems. I had an awaken fallen empire that were “benevolent interventionists” that was pumping out planetcrafts and fleets like it was copying and pasting them. But the funny thing is that they were all in the same system, every single ship. I had 3 systemcrafts, countless planetcrafts and attack moons, as well as 20 something fleets of riddle escorts that were 70+ million fleet power. The level of ships that this empire had made my fleet look pathetic. So I decided to take out that system, along with everything in it. Took that system out before they declared war on me, and by doing so, they never made another ship after that. Nothing was queued up, no armies were being made, nothing. So it’s needless to say that I took them out, but I didn’t know by wiping out every single one of their ships would make the AI just give up. No additional ships ever spawned either, because I’m sure that they spawn in ships after their fleet power drops below a certain point. 

Still, it was really funny regardless. My head cannon said it was because they didn’t want to fight me because they’d loose, especially since I remotely destroyed everything they’ve ever built. But I really did break them, which I haven’t been able to do yet until now",2025-04-08 00:31:42+00:00,0,0

1ju0dmf,Stellaris,Fanatic Purifiers in early game make me want to go INSANE (Rant),"Post-writing the below: I was very angry when I wrote this. I was also probably biting off more than I could chew when I created this galaxy.

TITLE. Where do they get their 40 corvettes before I can get my hands on 20? The Shroud? Those weird systems with no hyperlane link? I don't know. Why do they always come to screw me over just as I finish colonizing my fourth planet? I don't know. What have I done to deserve the divine punishment of having one of these things spawn next to me no matter what? I don't know.

Once I encounter one of these stupid empires in my early game, the year suddenly goes from 2220 to 40000. I have to shift my entire nation to military, hunker down all of my planets, and try and hold off the fleet of 40 corvettes and 3 destroyers as my alloy production just broke 40. Chokepoints? They're still getting upgraded to starports because I wasn't expecting neighbors this early and I thought I'd get to do some trading. Fortresses? I thought I'd have more than a core sector before I'd start needing those.

Maybe I'm not used to getting screwed over like this? Too used to being able to expand? Or I'm just bad.  I'm going to try and salvage this before I consider becoming what I hate.",2025-04-08 00:09:49+00:00,6,7

1ju060g,ConsumerRatings,Need help deciding between iPhone 16 Pro or Samsung Galaxy S24 FE,"Hey guys, I'm a bit torn on what to get. I am familiar with both iPhone and Samsung phones. Lately I've been leaning more towards going back to Android, and have been eyeing up the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE. 

But, I am also looking at the newest iPhone 16 Pro and I'm kind of interested in the features the phone boasts. Can anyone share their experiences with their phone? Even if it was an iteration below. I mainly want to know about how their cameras compare along with battery life. Which one do you consider to be the better option of the two? ",2025-04-07 23:59:44+00:00,1,0
1ju05bx,SnyderCut,James Gunn is a Terrible Person And Should Be Fired,"1. He is one of the most overrated directors along with Michael Bay who has only show time after time again that he introduce half baked ""comedy"" into his movies and nothing else. He is a one trick pony who isn't even good with his one trick. It would be one thing to have him even direct a single more movie but it is completely idiotic to have him run an entire franchise. Any of the serious moments he has in his movies are extremely cliche and are almost always interrupted by a terrible joke. There is no soul or passion put into his work and will just turn DC into how the MCU has been the last 2 phases.

2. The circumstances of Henry Cavils firing was disgusting. He was baited into thinking that he was going to be reprising the role of superman all for that to be crushed. On top of that he was replaced by an actor that cannot compare to him in anyway. He doesn't even look like superman.

3. James Gunn has said some of the most disgusting and revolting shit you can imagine on twitter. The fact that Marvel even allowed him to finish Guardians of the Galaxy is disgusting. It was not just one weird tweet. It's like 100s of tweets of him saying some of the most disgusting and disturbing things you could think of. Someone like this does not belong anywhere near a superhero film especially among the likes of Superman who is supposed to represent the best of humanity. Again it wasn't just a one time incident but he said weird shit over and over. Also keep in mind he wasn't some angsty 16 year old saying those things but he was in his 40-50s who should have known better. ",2025-04-07 23:58:48+00:00,0,13
1ju03wb,TheTowerGame,Module Choice for Tourney,"i have a mythic Harmony Conductor, a legendary Multiverse Nexus, and an epic Dimension Core. 

i can't figure out which is better for a tournament: mythic HC or epic DC. i run a legendary Galaxy Compressor.

HC has +2 DW quantity, x15 DW damage, 3x GT bonus, -3 sec BH CD
DC has +6% CL chance, x25 CL damage, +1 CL quantity

because my BH CD is 47s, and duration is 35s i can usually keep BH up in tournaments most of the time. without the -3 seconds i usually get bombarded by enemies in later champ waves. CL isn't super developed but it does have x387 damage, 3 quantity, 12.5% default.

1ju02oh,NatureofPredators,Reason & rant about the delay for the new chapter of Lost Spirits,"*So…*I writing this for two reasons. Number 1; I would like to let y’all know it’ll be a bit until the next chapter. And 2; because I am about to explode if I don’t share. 

So yeah, I got a bit sidetracked working on the worldbuilding for a story me and my friend have been working on for almost a year now. So I’m only about halfway through the new chapter. 

Now I shall share the thing I’ve been working on (whether or not you read I care not, I just need to let it out lol). 

Now before i begin, I must give the BIGGEST of disclaimers: this is still a highly work in progress, and as such take all this with a truckload of salt. 

**PS: if anyone knows a better place to share, please tell me.**

Firstly, here’s a little summary for the general concept and/background lore. 

———
> *Magic is real, yet finite. Throughout the Milky Way galaxy, there is nearly no magic, yet some places are like an oasis in a desert; overflowing with magic. It is in these places, that sapience is born. Harnessing the power of magic, these species flourish in unprecedented golden ages. But magic is finite, and before they even realize, they have drained the magic of their home. Every time, they unknowingly throw themselves into a deadly societal collapse.*
> 
> *Yet there is a single exception. Unlike other every sapient, Humanity avoided this fate. From the earliest days of Humanity, they had a strong concept of the Spiritual and the Divine. From this almost instinctual drive towards spirituality, Humanity did what no other known species has done; they formed Gods before they had even lit their first magical fire. And when Humanity reached toward the stars, they quickly found out how luck they were. Humanity found the Evari in the throes of a cataclysmic magical collapse. And in the Evari’s darkest days, Humanity selflessly charged in to save them. Their compassion and generosity would eventually lead to forming a league of people, united under the desire to simply help. A federation of crusaders who brave the darkness in the name of kindness.*
———

The general idea is that the story will be split into a 3 book trilogy system. The first trilogy is the most developed for plot ideas, and the general plot summary for the first book is:

> *Two new species have been found, each from different moons of a gas giant. However, they have caused massive ripples within the GCF (the faction thingy that organizes the exploration and aid). This is because they managed to rebound from their magic depletion induced societal collapse startlingly fast. When the GCF found them, they had already even colonized nearby stars. But a shadowy intelligence agency within the GCF, named the GIA, has been trying to stop them from joining the GCF (for reasons). And it falls to a group of idealistic diplomats to uncover this insidious plot and put a stop to it.* 

And now for the second most devolved part so far:

**The Magic System!**

The magic works on a system of *planes of existence*, the first one being a plane of pure energy magic roiling around so densely that even glancing at it causes the minds of any try to immediately go insane and completely loose itself. The next plane is where magical energy from the first plane seeps through like a light drizzle; yet even still, only the most powerful mages can directly use its power. Most mages must pull from the many *elemental planes*; where the magic from the second plane ends up becoming attuned to different elements; the main four being fire, water, lightning, and radiation. 

Above those planes is the material plane, the overworld, or simply the *real world*. Literally just reality, where we live and die. Speaking living and dying, above the material plane is the *Plane of Souls*! Every living sapient creature’s essence is reflected here, and upon their death their soul is taken through here before being brought to whatever afterlife they devoted themselves most to in life, in the *Plane of the Divine*.

Switch: Ante 8 Boss, Purple Stake on Checkerboard is Amber Acorn.

Two of the jokers are eternal and can't be sold, so I can identify them. One of the other 3 must be leftmost for eternal Brainstorm.

So, as I keep trying to decide what to do on the Switch, I've been playing and playing and playing and playing Checkerboard Purple Stake on my Galaxy Tab. Ante 8 Boss? Yep. Amber Acorn. And joker order is, again, critical. 

On the plus side, each joker's sell value is different (so happy I checked) thanks to earlier usage of Gift joker. So I will be able to re-order them. On the downside, the chance I can hit 400K is close to zero. The Ante 7 Boss was the Ox so I have almost no income for a reroll or an arcana or celestial or anything.

It reminded me of watching a projector on a wall that's too bright. And before you tell me how awesome it is—mine was not! I tried all brightness levels, modes, etc. I tested it on the ROG Ally and my Galaxy Z Fold 5, and both videos and games were so underwhelming that I had to go back to my Viture Pro, which was perfectly fine.

1jtzhuq,pokemon,Imagine this as a short movie like film/I'm a little biased to Zacian if you couldn't tell,"Title: The War of Eternity: A Legendary Battle Royale

In a dimension beyond time, where the stars never fade and the ground is forged from crystallized energy, an ancient bell tolled. It echoed through all realities, summoning every legendary and mythical Pokémon across space, time, and dreams. This was the War of Eternity — a trial to determine the ultimate force in the universe.

No sides. No alliances. Only one could remain.


---

The Beginning: The Rift Opens

The skies tore apart as Arceus, the Original One, appeared at the center of the arena — a divine judge in a war of gods. With a silent pulse, it vanished, leaving the battle to unfold.

Lightning struck. From the heavens descended:

Zapdos, Moltres, and Articuno — fierce and wild.

Lugia rose from the oceans below, and Ho-Oh from the flaming winds above.

Mewtwo, a clone born of ambition, hovered silently, scanning for threats.


Suddenly, the ground trembled — titans emerged:

Regirock, Regice, Registeel, Regieleki, and Regidrago awakened in unison.

Groudon erupted from magma.

Kyogre surged from ethereal waves.

Rayquaza coiled from the atmosphere, roaring with fury.



---

Round One: Chaos Unleashed

The skies lit up as Zekrom, Reshiram, and Kyurem clashed in a triad of power. Kyurem unleashed Glaciate, freezing half the field, trapping Cresselia, Virizion, and Manaphy in ice.

Darkrai slithered through shadows, putting Celebi and Shaymin to sleep, only to be ambushed by Genesect, who fired a Techno Blast that shook the arena.

Xerneas and Yveltal collided in a storm of life and death, while Zygarde, in its 50% form, watched patiently from the side, waiting to intervene.

Latios and Latias darted through the battlefield, narrowly avoiding Deoxys in its Speed Form.


---

Round Two: Betrayals and Collapses

From the Ultra Space gateway came:

Nihilego, Buzzwole, Pheromosa, Xurkitree, Celesteela, Kartana, Guzzlord, and Poipole — the Ultra Beasts, untamed and unpredictable.


Necrozma, in its Ultra Form, clashed violently with Solgaleo and Lunala, consuming their light and temporarily blinding the field.

Zacian and Zamazenta fought side by side until Eternatus descended, warping the arena with its Eternabeam. The brothers turned on it with legendary coordination.

Mew, hidden all along, copied Jirachi’s Doom Desire and launched it into the core of the battle, causing an explosion that sent Tornadus, Thundurus, Landorus, and even Regigigas flying into the void.


---

Round Three: Ascension and Fall

Dialga and Palkia battled for dominance over time and space, ripping apart sections of the arena. Giratina emerged from the Distortion World and dragged them both into a twisted plane.

Heatran and Volcanion erupted a lava field, but were overwhelmed by Suicune’s purifying water and Raikou’s thunder fury.

Entei and Terrakion charged through the rubble, bringing down weakened legends like Kubfu, Zarude, and Keldeo.


---

The Final Convergence

The battlefield now held only the most relentless:

Mewtwo, sharpened by the chaos.

Zacian, scarred but determined.

Giratina, returning from the void.

Rayquaza, still reigning in the skies.

Hoopa Unbound, having unleashed its true power.

Calryex, astride its Spectrier steed.

Magearna, glowing with soul-heart energy.

And from the shadows — Arceus returned, final judge and last challenger.


One final roar. A blinding clash of godly power.

And then… silence.


Arceus Returns

As time stitched itself back together, Arceus descended once more. It looked upon the fallen, the victors, and those lost to time. It did not speak. It merely raised a hoof — and the battlefield reset, fragments sealed, survivors scattered.

The War of Eternity was over.
No victor.
Only memory.
Only legend.

And in a cave, deep beyond space — Mew opened its eyes.

The story was not over.


The War of Eternity: Part III – The Final Awakening

The battlefield was still.

Time had shattered. Space had folded. Energy had faded.

All that remained was Arceus, the Prime Creator, standing in the void. Around it lay the fallen — gods, beasts, titans, avatars of the elements — broken and scattered. Nothing dared breathe.

But deep beneath the wreckage… life stirred.


---

The Bloom of Rebirth

A glimmer of blue light.

Roots of pure energy burst from the ground, weaving through the shattered realm. At the center of the crater where Xerneas fell, its body cracked and motionless, a single horn began to glow.

The Forest Spirit’s Last Gift.

Drawing on its own life force, Xerneas unleashed Geomancy at full power — not to fight, but to restore. Energy pulsed out like a heartbeat, flooding the land with light.

One by one, they rose:

Latias and Latios, wings reborn in glowing light.

Kyogre, roaring as oceans returned to the void.

Zekrom and Reshiram, emerging like twin stars reborn.

Giratina, shaken but alive, rising from the ashes.

Even Zamazenta, barely clinging to existence, stood again.


Mythical and Legendary Pokémon from every corner of existence blinked into being — not revived by time, not resurrected by science — but reborn by hope.

At the center of the light stood Zacian, her blade gleaming brighter than ever before.

Xerneas had given its life — so that the legends could rise once more.

And now, they had one final enemy to face.


---

The Final War: All vs. One

Arceus, now aware of their return, let out a soundless cry. The sky fractured again. It ascended into its full Primal Form, radiating Judgment, its 18 plates of reality orbiting like moons.

The air warped. Time unraveled. Gravity collapsed. And still…

The Legends Charged.

Rayquaza led the skies, dodging Judgment beams while firing Hyper Beams at divine speed.

Mewtwo struck with a Mind Pulse that destabilized Arceus’s senses.

Yveltal and Xerneas’s soul, still flickering in Zacian’s blade, radiated the balance of life and death.

Groudon and Kyogre collided into Arceus’s lower defenses with elemental fury.

Zacian fought at the front, slashing through godly energy, glowing with every step.


Even Hoopa Unbound returned, summoning copies of ancient gods to distract Arceus for mere seconds — enough for the rest to push forward.

The battle lasted what felt like eternity.

Arceus withstood everything. It grew larger. Stronger. Its plates spun faster — changing types, changing form, adapting to every move thrown at it.


---

The Final Blow

In the eye of the storm, Zacian stood alone.

Her mane torn, her blade cracked, her legs shaking — and yet, her eyes blazed with the fire of every fallen ally.

Behind her stood their spirits: Zamazenta, Xerneas, Magearna, Shaymin, even Mew, glowing faintly in the light. All their energy poured into her sword — the sword of legends, now reforged in truth.

Arceus descended for one final blow — its Judgment beam the size of a galaxy.

Zacian leapt.

She dashed faster than light, through the beam, through time, through fear itself — her blade humming with divine essence.

And with a howl that shook the stars…

She struck.

The Sword of the Forest pierced the heart of creation.


---

The End and the Beginning

Arceus froze. Its plates shattered, falling like meteors across all realms. The storm ended. The void cleared. Light returned.

And then… silence.

Arceus did not scream. It simply faded — not destroyed, but dissolved — its energy scattered into balance once more.

The war was over.


---

The Age of Legends

The legends did not return to slumber. Instead, they watched over the world together. Not as rulers, but as guardians.

Zacian, crowned the greatest of them all, became the Eternal Champion — her name etched in the stars, her blade buried where Arceus fell, as a monument of peace.

And deep in a new forest, grown where the battlefield once was, the wind sings a howl every night — the sound of a warrior who ended the Great War…

…with one final strike.

1jtzfq0,Surface,Anyone return the Surface Pro for a laptop?,"I purchased an open box SP9 and a SL5 (15"") to try them both out and see which one I liked better for a mobile device. I have a desktop and previously used a Surface Go for in home portability, light travel and bedtime media consumption.

I thought the SP9 would be perfect for me, but it doesn't feel that way. Figured the screen and power would be a huge upgrade to the smaller Go. The device is definitely beautiful, but it feels a little too big for it's form. Due to it's size, it's not very nimble to open up, or carry around room to room while open. It was easy to do this with the Go due to the compact size. Oddly enough, it feels more fluid to move the 15"" SL5 around.

The screen is great and it props up well with the kickstand, which was always what I loved about the Surface, but I think it's about an inch or two too big for media consumption.

1jtzbmt,arknights,Long-Awaited Reunion,"**15-16**:

Black Originium dust accumulated on the deck, and tiny Originium crystal clusters grew like weeds. Even on the land you can see, they are spreading at a speed visible to the naked eye. In the sunlight, they shine with a charming luster.

The scene before your eyes is too abnormal, it is unlike any Catastrophe you have ever seen.

You looked down at the deck beneath your feet, which was completely covered with Originium, with only your shadow reflected on it.

You turned your head, only to see Kal'tsit's shocked expression.

You followed her gaze and saw that, far away on the deck, a small cluster of black Originium crystals was slowly growing towards the sky. In every facet of the Originium crystal, you can vaguely see a white figure. You are not unfamiliar with that figure——The black Originium rain suddenly became more violent. They are not coming from the air, but dense black raindrops are rising from the earth to the sky.

They refract the sunlight into colorful colors, drawing colorful lines on the horizon. All the colours you can see begin to regroup, like a white curtain with a rainbow halo slowly descending. It was a pure white colour without any impurities, gently draped over the cluster of Originium crystals on the deck. 

A beautiful figure stood on the crystal. 

The black crystals were slowly retreating from her legs, and the white light had covered her with a coat.The world of white and black, and—— 

Doctor: ......Prriestess. 



**15-17 Before:**

I believe that the connection between us transcends time and space.Even if the oceans boil and the atmosphere disappears, even if our satellites fall into the vortex of gravity one after another, even if our sun expands viciously and ruthlessly devours its children until all is silent...

We will meet again. At the end of civilization, decorated with darkness and starlight, we will meet again. Definitely.I will wait until that day. I will definitely wait until that day. Wait for me. You have to wait for me too.

https://preview.redd.it/nxq1ar3sohte1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=04b26d6dba883f410b39de3b32da9548dd6a8065

...Don't forget me.

A black-haired woman in a white coat stood on the deck a little further away, staring intently at the sky.Until she noticed your arrival, she turned around and looked at you with a bright smile on her face.

You are pretty sure you have seen this face before. In your dreams within your dreams, or in the deepest corners of your sleeping memories. But this is definitely not a dream. You can clearly feel that she is standing in front of you, and every one of your senses can clearly perceive her presence.

Amiya: Doctor, this person...is Priestess? This is the enemy that Dr. Kal'tsit has been on guard against...

Although she didn't understand the danger she was about to face, Amiya still stood in front of you out of habit, ready to fight.But you really cannot make an accurate judgment on the current situation, but you are very clear that this is different from any powerful enemy or any crisis you have faced before.

The woman in front of you doesn't seem to have any hostility, but your instinct tells you that this is an immeasurable danger. She spoke softly. 

Priestess: {@nickname}, you were one step ahead of me. You didn't wait in the awakening room to share my joy of seeing this new world for the first time. But how can I bear to blame you for being a little impatient?

You also feel her pure and sincere gaze. In the distance, there were sounds of wind and thunder, as well as the faint rustling of Originium spreading. In this noisy and chaotic space, she just stares at you intently, with no room for anything else in her eyes. 

Priestess: Although this reunion is different from what we expected, I am willing to accept this unexpected experience. We have imagined together countless times the scene of our first meeting after waking up from hibernation.

Priestess: The Originium has completely covered the planet. We can roam freely on it. This is a world that belongs only to us. This world is only one step away from our shared ultimate vision, and we are moving towards new hope... Besides, it should be a bright sunny day.

Amiya: Doctor, look at the clouds in the sky——

Amiya noticed the unusual phenomenon in the sky and immediately issued a warning to you. But you can’t imagine, or even comprehend, what you are seeing with your own eyes at this moment. 

As soon as Priestess finished her words, the thick disaster clouds in the sky began to shrink and fold in a regular but strange manner until they disappeared completely, leaving behind a canvas-like sky. Natural disasters, the most terrible calamities on this earth, just disappeared into thin air. You realize a terrible truth. 

Doctor: You can completely ""control"" Originium...?

Priestess: {@nickname}, this question is unfamiliar to me. This is our common creation, the crystallization that belongs only to you and me, and it is the seed of hope. But alas... you don't remember it anymore, do you?

Doctor: Originium...is our creation?I don't remember...

Priestess: I know that due to some unfortunate accident, you lost part of your memory. Although it is regrettable, I believe that the loss of some memories will not change your nature, and the connection between us is unshakable. I don't mean to be hard on you, but I hope you understand - time is tight and we have a lot to do. But we can always enjoy working together, right?

Priestess: Come back to me, Dr.{@nickname}...Turn Terra into Originium.  
  
Cast into a ladder to the future. The gentle call seems to suddenly ring in your ears, and you feel extremely happy. You are certain that you cannot recall a single fragment of her from your memory, yet your connection to this person goes beyond memory or the information contained in language. It was an almost instinctive reaction. 

You involuntarily took a step forward.

Kal: Dr.{@nickname}! 

Kal'tsit was behind you, holding your arm tightly, and weak tremors could be felt through her palms. You noticed that Kal'tsit hadn't said a word since a while ago. She was already extremely weak when she left the sarcophagus, and now she even had to struggle to stand. You are confused. You expect Kal'tsit to give you some guidance or a simpler and clearer answer as usual. At this moment, she seemed to be in great torment, with a struggling and painful expression. After a long moment, she let go. She leaves the choice entirely up to you. 

Doctor: I will not let the Originium destroy Terra. 

Priestess......You see a shadow in her eyes, a clear sign of disappointment. For some reason, your heart tightens. 

Priestess: It's you...AMa-10. Although your current appearance is very different from when you were born, how could I not recognize this creation that I have poured my emotions into?

Priestess: But the principles of your behavior do not seem to be in line with the goals set when you were born. I want to know what made you change your mind.

Kal: Unlike your despicable scam... my goal has never changed.

Priestess: Yes...it was you who regarded that person's order as an unshakable goal. So you hindered Originium's plan and wasted the already limited time. 

P: So, {@nickname}, how can I make you understand...how disappointed I am. 

Priestess: And you, AMa-10, how can I forgive your betrayal? You have broken the language ban I set, right Such precautions are not enough to completely restrict your activities. If that's the case, why not speak out What's all the things you wanted to say but couldn't tell {@nickname} for all this time?

Kal: Priestess... \*Unknown language expletive\*.

...

P: I am surprised at your understanding of the past, and I don’t completely agree with your expression...but it doesn’t matter anymore. AMa-10, what can you do now?

Kal: ...Mon3tr!

Mon3tr: (Excited roar)

K: Destroy her. She is Priestess, the creator of Originium from the previous civilization, who wants to assimilate everything on this planet. Therefore, she is the enemy of all life on Terra.

Priestess: The choice is yours...

K: I’m Kal’tsit, a doctor from Rhodes Island, and a companion of Amiya and the Doctor.

K: You are already worthless to me.



**15-17**:

P: You look a little down, {@nickname}. 

Oracle: QHU9112, another faded galaxy. What is affecting us is only the first wave. His coming is faster than we expected. We are running out of time...

P: But we're ready, right? We have planted the seeds of hope, and now we just have to wait for them to grow into answers. Don't worry, just treat it as a normal hibernation. Except that the time is a little longer, it is no different from the previous time travel.

P: Besides, this time, I will be by your side. I hope that after crossing the eternal night of silence, when I open my eyes again, I can still see you the first thing. But our debate still hasn't come to an answer...

O: Originium is our last hope, and we have little other options. We must choose our path with clarity and caution.

Priestess gently took the hand of the person next to him. Her unspoken thoughts turned into tangible images in this mind resonance room. They were graphics that symbolized joy and hope. Her eyes were sincere, without any cloud in them. 

P: {@nickname}, I never forgot our topic. There should be no reservations between us. See, this is what I have in mind when we talk about our future. We should have the same expectations. The same grey matter pins embedded in our minds are also what connect us together. 

P: Your mind and mine are thus closely connected until our consciousness dies along with the entire universe. Our thoughts collide and we argue endlessly, but it is precisely because of this that we can best understand each other's nature. I am very sure that it is our nature to have hope for the future, and we are each other's anchors in this empty sea of ​​stars.

O: Even if our differences over Originium cannot be unified? The paths we have chosen cannot coexist...

P: In that case, let's continue waiting. If you don't want to go into hibernation yet, that's okay, we still have some time. We can read together the classics stored in DWDB. There are also many poems left by dead planets in the universe that we can interpret.

P: I will never force anything on you until you make up your mind - I will never impose my will on you. {@nickname}, I will wait until you make the choice to stand with me.

O: Priestess... 

P: Take it easy, {@nickname}, all that observing has been exhausting for you. Close your eyes and take a break. I will play for you a chord played by the gravity of distant stars. You will have a good dream.Good night, {@nickname}.Until the end of time, we crossed over into a universe of silence.  
  
I will wait for you in that world.

...

P: As you said, you do have a chance to kill me now... But, would a stand made of Originium make you so panicked?

Kal: ......!

P: AMa-10, I have no intention of debating with you the values ​​you believe in. The things you have been insisting on are so small that I can't even find a credible logical framework to evaluate their significance. But this is what happens in experiments, where small errors eventually lead to huge obstacles. I have to accept this result.

P: I'm sorry to have to erase you as this error.

Priestess raised her hand.The Originium begins to grow again, and the sharp branches made of crystals densely surround you and Amiya, and are about to swallow you up in an instant. Amiya tried her best to use magic to shatter the surrounding Originium, but the crystal cluster grew much faster.

Amiya: Doctor! Hide behind me—

It all happened in a [flash.You](http://flash.You) saw the Originium crystal cluster explode very close to you. Amiya wanted to protect you, but time did not allow her to react. You see the black monster coming to you and Amiya at this moment, using its huge and solid body to block you and the Originium crystal cluster. You saw Kal'tsit...

Priestess: What a pity.

The accident happened extremely suddenly, but it was enough for you to understand this cruel fact. The enemy you are fighting against is not one that can be understood by common sense. She has the authority to control all Originium. The Originium crystal on Kal'tsit's right shoulder is the proof that she was born as a human being, but it is also the cause of her life. 

The Originium crystals began to spread until they engulfed her entire body, then shattered and dissipated in the wind - your eyes didn't have time to capture the entire process. The stronger you are, the more fragile you are. The life of the immortal ends here. She has fulfilled her promise.

Before you have time to think about what just happened, Kal'tsit has completely disappeared from your sight.. .Only the coat was left on the deck.

Mon3tr(Painful scream)

Immediately after Kal'tsit disappeared, Mon3tr's huge body began to shrink and turned into a black crystal-like ""cocoon"". 

Priestess: The AMa-10 unit was also one of my proudest creations. This is not the result I expected.

D: She has her own name. Her name is ""Kal'tsit"".

Priestess: It already has its own code name, and I don't see the point in naming it again.

Priestess walked towards the cocoon-like object left on the deck. 

Amiya- Doctor, stand back! I have to protect Mon3tr!

The threads spread out from Amiya's staff, trying to stop Precious's progress...But the Originium on the ground can always grow out from tricky angles and internalise all of Amiya's spells. You can tell Amiya is struggling. The almost unstoppable Precious in front of him, and the only thing Kal'tsit had left—

P: Do you want to save it? I want to fix it, just like you. The AMa-10 unit not only carries our common expectations, it also preserves a record that is extremely important to me. 

P: Dr.{@nickname}, why...are you afraid of me? 

Pink threads burst out from Amiya's staff and danced in the space enclosed by the Originium. But you can clearly see that Amiya is under tremendous pressure. Priestess's figure was also completely obscured by the Originium... In every fragment of the Originium, on every edge of the Originium, you can clearly see the eyes of Precious. It's like...

Doctor: She’s…everywhere.

  
**15-21**:

Dr.{@nickname}, you don't understand what you are doing right now...  
  
I'm sorry that you've forgotten everything, our lost quest in the universe, the shared anchoring pin in our minds, our ten-thousand-year-long ""debate"".  
  
And the promise you made to me in the beginning...Time is the cruelest maze, always making people lost and separated.  
  
But I believe, I always believe, that you will re-recognize the truth of this universe and recognize the ending we must face.  
  
I believe that by that time, you will come back to me.

1jtz2mz,AdvLiterateRP,[M4F] [1X1][Discord]Searching For A Long Term Partner For A Star Wars Story,"



Hello everyone! As the title suggests, i’m looking for a partners long term RP centered around two characters in the star wars universe. For a bit of background, i’ve been writing for about 7 years, and i started roleplaying around 3 years ago. My responses range anywhere from 3-6 paragraphs and i’m constantly fighting with the character limit on pretty much every app 😂I’m available pretty much every night from 9PM until around 3AM EST, and most hours of the day on weekends. I can play in 1st or 3rd person, so whichever one you prefer is fine.

The plot is centered around a newly indoctrinated Sith Apprentice and his Master, and details their adventures as Master and student. There is an element of romance to it, but delving into their dynamic and the psychology behind it is what i’m most interested in. For the dynamic, it’d be best if you were okay with taking a domineering role, romantically and otherwise since you would be playing his superior. Here’s a little plot sample to give you an idea of what i’m looking for.


“Do not let him escape.”

“Yes, Master.”

Cain’s muscles burned with over exertion. He pushed on purely from adrenaline, chasing his prey through the extraordinarily dense jungle that covered most of this planet. The downpour made an already grueling chase exceedingly difficult, limiting visibility and making every square inch of ground a slip hazard. Three days of tracking and chasing, deprived of any nourishment beyond river water cultivated in this moment. His combat boots sunk into the rain-soaked jungle floor with every step, forcing him to exert even more energy lifting his legs out of the ground. His master trailed a few feet behind him, gliding effortlessly through the treacherous terrain. Even in this moment of strife, he remained in awe of his master. To Cain, she possesses the kind of power that demands devotion. Being the apprentice of such a feared and storied woman in the Sith Order was his highest honor and greatest privilege.

His prey’s frantic footsteps were getting lost in the rustle of the endless greenery. He growled with anger and pressed on. His muscles screamed at him with every footstep, but he ignored them. There was no failing when it came to his Master’s requests. Regardless of his unwavering tenacity, he could feel his body giving way to exhaustion. His mind scrambled, searching for another solution. His body moved on autopilot, vaulting over fallen trees and bounding off of tree stumps as he mentally combed through hours of sith training. Just as his body began to shut down, the answer came. He skids to a stop and pulls the vibroblade off of his hip. His Master comes to a stop by his side and watches intently.

Cain shuts his eyes and focuses, reaching out in front of him with the force. He finds his target among the trees easily. His fear alienates him from the creatures of the wilderness. Cain does not hesitate, throwing the weapon blade over handle at his prey. It cuts through the greenery with a deadly whistle and buries  itself blade first in the back of his prey’s knee. A pained yelp rings out among the trees and the sound of a body hitting the grass tails behind. Cain was on him in no time at all, slipping the knife from his knee and turning him face up to secure his kill.

Today’s target was a padawan, undoubtedly lost or otherwise separated from his Master. It isn’t often that such an opportunity presents itself, so Master was especially insistent on Cain tracking him down. They met eyes for the first time up close. His facial features were soft, full lips and tanned skin hidden under a scraggly mop of brown hair. His blue eyes shone were stricken with primal fear and sleep deprivation, his face was bone thin and flushed. The padawan screamed for his life, but his pleas were short lived; Cain had no interest in listening to them. He dragged the blade in a deep arc across the padawan’s  throat and swiftly ended his life. 

Exhaustion finally starts to set in. Cain rolls onto his back and collapses next to his prey, exhaling as he stares up at vegetation so thick it could serve as a shield from the rain.  

“This prey was especially tenacious.” His master remarked as she stepped over him, inspecting the lifeless body of the padawan. Cain collected himself, pushing to his feet after a brief respite. His muscles protested, but he refused to allow himself anything beyond a momentary rest in the presence of his Master.

“He was weak.” Cain growled between labored breaths. “I offered him a fair bout of combat and he fled from me.”

“He could sense your intentions.” his Master remarked as she met his gaze. Cain discreetly took in a breath. His Master was a breathtaking sight, and her crimson-red eyes never failed to captivate him.

“My intentions were to fight to the death. He fled because of cowardice.”

“Not simply a fight.” His Master waved off his protest.

“I don’t understand.”

“He was young, and in training. Just as you once were. If, at the beginning of your training, i offered you a proper bout of combat, but you knew that my true desire consisted of whipping your skin to ribbons, tearing the flesh off your bones, and breaking every aspect of your being before driving a blade into your neck and watching you heave your last few desperate breaths of life as all of your pretty blood spilled onto your chest, would you be afraid?”

Cain swallowed and shook his head. He hadn’t realized how close his master had gotten. Her nose was mere inches from his.

“If your attempts at lying are going to remain this pathetic, i’m going to continue whipping you for telling them.” 

“Yes, Master, I would be afraid.”

Cain’s master held her stare for what seemed like an eternity. Cain always hated when she did this. Her stare was piercing. He could almost feel it tearing through every layer of his being to uncover whatever truth it searched for.

“You did not simply want to kill the padawan, you wanted to make him suffer. Your hatred is burning wildly, overflowing and unruly. Feelings such as yours are encouraged, but must be kept in check. With time, you will learn to temper your rage and use it to your advantage.” Cain’s Master smiled as she brushed past him, trudging back into the woods. 

“Come. We will camp by the waterfall nearby for the night.”

“Are we not returning to the ship, Master?”

“No, we are not. Despite his juvenile attempt to lie to me, my apprentice killed a jedi padawan…”



“…and i feel it necessary to reward him.”


Beyond a few basic guidelines, I like my partnered go wild with the character i give them. Any ref, weapon or power you want to include is fine by me as long as the character has the basic personality traits I envisioned. I have a full character bio and ref for my character, which will be provided when we start brainstorming. Also, as a small aside, if you don’t want to write the action I will happily write it for us. I absolutely love writing combat scenes so if that isn’t something you’re into i’m glad to take the wheel.

I think a lot of the fun of this roleplay will be the globetrotting aspect of them doing missions in various environments throughout the galaxy, there’s endless possibilities for world building and interesting places to visit. If you’re still interested, feel free to send me a chat for more details!

I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+

1jtyuvk,DigitalNotebooks,Switching from Paper to Digital – Need Help Choosing a Device (Budget: €500),"Hey folks,

I work in a setting where taking notes during meetings is essential—and like many of you, I’ve always preferred handwriting over typing. I'm a bit old-school and have been using physical notebooks for years, but I'm now planning to switch to a digital note-taking setup. My reasons are:

1. I sometimes misplace my notebooks


2. I want to organise and manage my notes better


3. I need searchability in handwritten content



Here’s some context that might help with recommendations:
I usually write using ball pens with a fairly firm stroke, so I’m hoping to find a digital device that feels natural for that writing style. When taking meeting minutes, I tend to categorise discussion points (e.g., decisions, actions, blockers), so I’d love a tool that supports structured notes. Quick switching between pen colours would be super helpful too.

I tried the iPad recently at an Apple store, but I noticed a slight input lag—there was a delay between my writing and the ink appearing. I’m not sure if that’s typical across all devices, or just iPads. I haven’t tested Galaxy Tabs or other note-taking devices yet.

So I’d really appreciate your suggestions:

What’s a solid digital note-taking device under €500 that offers a responsive, paper-like writing experience?

Which note-taking app works well for structured meeting notes with easy color switching and categorization?


Looking forward to hearing from those who’ve made the leap from paper to digital—thanks in advance!

1jtytm8,ipadmini,Switching from Paper to Digital – Need Help Choosing a Device (Budget: €500),"Hey folks,

I work in a setting where taking notes during meetings is essential—and like many of you, I’ve always preferred handwriting over typing. I'm a bit old-school and have been using physical notebooks for years, but I'm now planning to switch to a digital note-taking setup. My reasons are:

1. I sometimes misplace my notebooks


2. I want to organise and manage my notes better


3. I need searchability in handwritten content



Here’s some context that might help with recommendations:
I usually write using ball pens with a fairly firm stroke, so I’m hoping to find a digital device that feels natural for that writing style. When taking meeting minutes, I tend to categorise discussion points (e.g., decisions, actions, blockers), so I’d love a tool that supports structured notes. Quick switching between pen colours would be super helpful too.

I tried the iPad recently at an Apple store, but I noticed a slight input lag—there was a delay between my writing and the ink appearing. I’m not sure if that’s typical across all devices, or just iPads. I haven’t tested Galaxy Tabs or other note-taking devices yet.

So I’d really appreciate your suggestions:

What’s a solid digital note-taking device under €500 that offers a responsive, paper-like writing experience?

Which note-taking app works well for structured meeting notes with easy color switching and categorization?


Looking forward to hearing from those who’ve made the leap from paper to digital—thanks in advance!

1jtyhb5,StarWarsvsWarhammer,Lore accurate battle.,"First we are rating the force as equivalent in total power to the warp because I said so.

Second remember that Warhammer is set in the distant future while star wars is actually set in the distant past.

You may choose any time period you want. but remember that all events in star wars occured before present day. So use warhammer time.

Star wars is based on a hypothetical far future version of the galaxy.

You should assume the availability of at least one of the star forge copies if your doing legends.

You should assume that the knowledge to build a planet destroying superweapon is well known.

You have 3 options for interacting

a wormhole opens from one galaxy to another

advanced scouts from the star wars galaxy

Remember that both occur in the same universe. just different galaxies.

1jty9dq,EliteDangerous,Galactic Powers,"As I am walking around trying to to get my baby to sleep I'm thinking about Elite Dangerous and have a couple thoughts I wanted to share.

1) The galaxy is huge and mostly undiscovered. It would be shocking if the Thargoids were the only other intelligent life, besides humans, out there. What if multiple galatic civilisations already exist out there in the black and we just haven't discovered them yet? Maybe contact with one of these undiscovered civilisations is the catalyst to humanity learning about what/who is out there. 

2) Going off the first thought. How would you feel if the game, over multiple years, evolved to a larger stage? Something like power play? The galaxy is large enough to easily accommodate 4 or 5 bubbles of different civilizations and still leave more than enough that is unknown/ripe for exploration? 

I'm guessing this is not a new thought, but I like the idea and was curious what others thought.

Ho intenzione ora come ora solo di verificare se è recuperabile (accensione/software) per poi eventualmente modificare il resto della console (schermo ecc).

[ Adjust Sound Settings With More Convenience ]

Fine-tuning your audio should be quick and easy so you can enjoy whatever you’re listening to anytime, anywhere. Galaxy Buds3 series makes the job much simpler with One UI 7, eliminating the need to separately access the Galaxy Wearable app on your smartphone each time you want to adjust the settings for your device. Now for the first time, conveniently adjust volume, noise control and sound settings all from your device’s quick settings panel for a hassle-free listening experience.


How to Adjust Buds Setting on Quick settings panel

1. Open Quick settings panel on your connected smartphone

2. Touch and hold the Volume slider in the panel

3. Tap which setting you would like to change




[ Personalize Sound Settings for Specific Apps ]

Sound setting preferences often vary by the app you’re using. For instance, when listening to music you may prefer the bass turned high, but when watching a movie, you prefer a more immersive 360-degree sound experience. With App sound settings, you no longer need to adjust sound settings each time you visit an app. Simply set your sound preferences for individual apps2 once via quick settings panel, and the Galaxy Buds3 series will automatically apply them whenever the app starts playing media. A first-of-its-kind feature, this capability delivers a more seamless daily audio routine, tailored to your liking.

 
How to Use App sound settings

1. Open Quick settings panel on your connected smartphone

2. Touch the Earbuds icon in the media panel or touch and hold the Volume slider above the media panel

The Bounty Hunters

There is a beep in the room and the guards are instantly on alert as Pukey sighs. “Stand down, I recognize that sound.”

“And what was that?” Observer Wu asks.

“Scaly! I don’t care if you left it in here a while ago or brought it in after us, this is not acceptable.” Pukey calls out. Then there’s another beep.

“Oh come on dad! This wasn’t even deliberate, I really did forget the drone in there, I just... listened after I found it.”

“I’m sure, how much did you listen in on?”

“Enough to know you’ve remembered some things wrong! I’ve been checking against my notes!”

“And you’re still insisting this was an honest mistake, while you are fact checking me?”

“Yes.”

“Points for audacity at any rate.” Pukey remarks as he runs his prosthetic arm through his hair. “Still, if you want to speak with Observer Wu so badly, then you can be next. Unless there’s an issue with the good Observer?”

“None whatsoever.” Observer Wu notes. “But for the sake of completeness, what was the mistake that your father made young Mister Schmidt?”

“Ivan sees the number girls as his granddaughters, because his crazy clone was his daughter and those girls were his daughter’s daughters. He’s still raising them like they’re his own little girls though.” Slithern says. “Still, if you want me over there, I’d love for a chance to brag.”

“What happened to that shy little snake I knew?”

“You made me stronger dad. I’m heading over.” Slithern sends before there’s a pause. “Also my guard is going to be with me for proper formal and ceremonial purposes. I’m getting more and more into the whole Lablan Noble flow.”

“I would like to hear how the young man ended up ennobled.”

“I’m sure that Slithern would love to tell you himself. It took some doing, but that boy is well and truly out of his shell and thriving in every way imaginable. Not bad for the mutilated and terrified child I found chained to the wall not far from this room.” Pukey says with a smile.

“You’re very proud of him.”

“I’ve done a lot to be proud of. But the miracle I’ve worked with that boy, that’s what is at the top of the list.” Pukey says with a smile.

“I saw the video, he did well enough with the whole ‘we are men’ bit before it was broken up. Has he truly changed that much?”

“See for yourself, he was either in his workshop or his room, and either way he’s going to be here shortly.”

“Well before he gets here, mind explaining what kind of... position he has if he sees combat?”

“Drone operator. He recons an area to give us a general overview without ever being seen by the enemy. That’s not to say that he doesn’t have some very impressive drones he’s made. But if things happen, then what we want out of him is recon. And if things get bad, we want him safe.” Pukey says.

“I see, and the fact that he is now ennobled by a foreign state?”

“Both the Lablan Empire and The Undaunted are testing each other. The Undaunted move at a faster pace. Ten, twenty years? Plenty of time for us, and to The Lablan Empire a short wait. IN the end what seems to be happening is that there’s going to be a new noble house of The Lablan Empire with Undaunted values and training. And no one can see anything wrong with that.”

“See anything wrong with what?” Slithern asks as he arrives. His guard behind him and a few drones floating alongside him. None of them armed, but the tools incorporated into a maintenance drone can pull a person apart easily.

One of his drones scoots off to the side and fetches the other drone he spoke through earlier, it’s more akin to a remote control tank with a camera instead of a cannon. “This one has a bad connection with it’s magnetic treads and has been here for a few days. But it wasn’t in the way and wasn’t going to damage anything, so I got caught up in a hundred other little things and forgot about it.”

As he explains he cracks open the small drone and quickly adjusts a few parts with the help of pair of tool drones, then he snaps it back together and sets it down where it quickly drives in a figure eight before rushing to the wall, climbing up with it’s treads and then leaving the room entirely out the open door. “Anyways, proper introductions time. I am Slithern Heartytail Schmidt, Undaunted Trainee, Landless Noble of the Lablan Empire and adopted son to Gregory, Cindy and Lytha Schmidt. With Miss Spindle as a potential addition to the family.”

“...” Observer Wu just gives Pukey a long slow look.

“What?” Pukey asks.

“Just something I’m never going to get used to and very much another reason why I’m definitely returning to Earth.” Observer Wu states. Still have a... hmm... what is the exact mechanics behind a tailed person having a seat?”

“Oh more akin to lounging. Observe.” Slithern states as he slithers over to a couch and relaxes onto it.

“Are you not travelling with a Nagasha woman? One of Harold’s wives?” Pukey asks.

“I am.” Observer Wu says.

“Then why did you need the demonstration?” Slithern asks.

“To see if you were the demonstrating type or the explaining type.” Observer Wu says with a slight smile. “You’re a bit of both, so I’m going to give you some room during the explanations so you have room to bring up whatever projections or make whatever gestures you need to clearly communicate.”

“Hunh, that’s actually somewhat clever.”

“Thank you, and since you’ve given me a proper introduction for yourself, Who are these young ladies with you? Your guard I assume?””

“Ladies, introduce yourselves please, and get comfortable. We’re among friends, even if it is a moderately formal situation.” Slithern says.

“I am Sergeant Migara, commanding officer of Lord Slithern’s Honourgard.” Migara says removing the helmet of her armour and then folding her natural Lete armour out of the way.

“I am Corporal Haltir, I’m the medically trained member of this Honourgard.” A Drin woman says next as she removes her own helmet. “And this is....”

“I can speak for myself cousin. I am Lathir, the technician of our group.” The second Drin states as she removes her own helmet.

“I am Corporal Jitte.” One of the remaining Lete states.

“And I am Corporal Ravine.” The final member of Slithern’s Honorguard states.

“So is the haircut part of the uniform?”

“Yes, while serving in an honorguard all guardswomen must wear their hair in an approved manner, unless granted permission otherwise. We have that permission, but no one’s interested. There’s a reason there is a regulation length and regulation treatment for our hair, and they’re good reasons.” Migara explains.

“Such as?”

“The treatment that turns our hair white gives us a mild Axiom protection against several negative effects. But by keeping our hair short we stop it from interfering with our technology and beneficial techniques.”

“Very interesting, and quite practical. What kind of effects does it protect from?”

“First off is a technique with as many names as there are variations. They let you borrow another’s senses. But with this hair we have a blanket protection.”

“Literally considering how thick it makes some of our hair.” Lathir notes.

“A good reason to have your hair like that. Now... Lord Slithern... are you allowed to speak of the events surrounding your rescue, and then the later events where you earned your title?”

“I’d rather skip over my rescue, if that’s alright, it’s still not the easiest subject to talk about. But I’ll gladly boast about how I earned my title!”

“Excellent, no doubt your father is more ready to inform me of your unfortunate first encounter, so...”

“How is meeting my father unfortunate? He rescued me!”

“The fact you needed rescuing at all is what is unfortunate.” Observer Wu counters diplomatically.

“So, it has taken you as a part of itself and there are three others, including the original Dark Forest of Serbow. The forest where fire is eaten by the trees.” Hafid muses. “Yet the very nature of this substance appears to be enhancing your Axiom capabilities.”

“It was the whole reason I was taken to begin with. It’s a powerful stimulant that was being controlled by a cult that worshipped it, but every generation had more and more people emerge as immune or resistant to it’s power. So new blood was needed.”

“And have they... bred you?” Hafid asks.

“They were about to.”

“But they have not?”

“No. They have not.”

“Good. You are a child still. Even if none of the emotional or logistical burden of rearing was left to you, there would still be a great sense of loss for having children too early.”

""What? I'm nearly fully grown!""

“In truth it has little to do with actual age so much as personal maturity. You are young and eager. You seek to push and grow and these are fine traits, but they are not suitable for a parent. A parent requires stability to provide the appropriate environment to grow and develop.”

“I see.”

“Do not be like this human here, he has clearly bred his brides despite being of a species that is categorically in an unstable position.” Hafid states and Harold just gives him a baffled look. Hafid turns to him. “Did you not consider the consequences of your actions?”

“Considering that I’ve been outright speaking to numerous members of my organization and have a residence already set aside, I can say that I have. What has me so confused is how quickly you go to insulting others. Are you really so undiplomatic that you cannot speak more than a paragraph without insulting, insinuating or otherwise trying to pick a fight?” Harold asks.

“Is there any point to NOT attempting provocation? If someone is so foolish as to believe their argument is best backed with violence then you can very easily disprove them by besting them in battle. At which point they will have no choice but to concede, or be in a position where they can be easily and permanently dealt with.”

“And what happens when your attitude simply has the less easily provoked merely walk away insulted?”

“Then they are cowards and unworthy of my time.”

“And they are left with the belief that you are a fool and unworthy of theirs, well done.” Harold says leaning forwards.

Hafid gives him an even look adn then glances to the monitor attached to the medical berth. “You have a clean bill of health. Leave my camp.”

“...? Fine. Terry, you know how to Woodwalk out of here if you need to.” Harold says.

“Just like that? Are you not a warrior?”

“I’m not an idiot, I don’t pick fights I don’t need.”

“Then how do you grow?” Hafid demands.

“By testing myself meaningfully and not randomly.”

“Testing yourself...” Hafid mutters as he clearly considers Harold again. “Would you acquiesce to a spar?”

“If you agree for it to be non-lethal then yes.”

“You fear death?”

“I don’t have time to be dead. I have a family on the way and I am at the cusp of history being made, I am going to be a part of it.” Harold replies.

“I suppose there is much that would be left undone if I were to die myself. Very well, I agree, our spar shall be non-lethal.” Hafid agrees. “This way.”

Then he leaves the tent, using his sword as a cane to help with his balance and not even giving anyone a second glance.

“So, I guess we all know why dad kept calling him The Demon.” Terry notes.

“Yep, and now we’re about to see how a demon fights.” Harold says as he heads out after Hafid.

“Think mister demon man has some girls we can fight? Or maybe he’d let us have some fun after he’s done with... yeah no, he’s not winning.” Agatha says with a chuckle.

“So certain are you that Hafid shall be bested, you truly do not know from where his strength comes. Do you?” A voice says from around them and Giria’s tail twists. “A good attempt, but my balance is better than that.”

The source of the voice is an Erumenta woman with darkness flowing off her in rivers.

“And who are you?” Terry asks and rather than answering she saunters over to him and puts a hand on his cheek.

“As Hafid refers to me as mother, you may refer to me as grandmother. And while my child has chosen to defend that which struggles to defend itself, he is a warrior through and through.”

“I’m sorry, who are you?”

“Jin Shui Wayne and it is the blood of my family to have our elements alter with each generation... and the sheer power that emerged with Hafid...” She trails off before a sudden wave of heat so dry that the air itself seems to crackle sweeps over them all. “They have begun already. Hafid must be eager.”

At the agreed upon sparring area Harold raises a thumb to his lips and pulls it back. They’ve cracked open in the sheer baking heat. The area had gone from a comfortable forest to a desert at high noon in the midst of a heat-wave. The heat distortions alone blurred and concealed almost everything to sight alone.

“That you can even remain standing is a tribute to your capacity human. But it shall avail you little, the final truth of nature is that in the end all are kindling before the cleansing flame.”

“Debatable.” Harold says with blood dripping then drying off his now severely chapped lips. “But impressive either way.”

Hafid raises a single eyebrow as Harold takes a combat ready stance. “Very well, if you wish to continue I will teach you why Blood Sonir were regarded so highly by hunters before we could even comprehend.”

1jtx94m,offmychest,I don’t know if i regret getting a second (and third) cat,"I’m on broken sleep and its been a long day and I’m frustrated and crying so I hope this is coherent I apologise if not. I do mention a deceased cat so please be cautious. 

This kind of started last May. I had an older cat who ended up passing away in December of 2024. Before that though I got a second cat in May. I don’t know what sparked the idea or want because I was very content with my old man but I got Cat 2 (C2). I wasn’t prepared for him and while I didn’t neglect him I definitely played favourites without realising and I believe he favours my grandmother (who he used to sleep at night with since I was with him sometimes*** during the day, so I was with my original cat at night. I thought that was fair). I know why he favours my grandma, I would leave when he napped which I regret doing. 
Whatever the case it’s been about 3 months since my original cat passed and C2 got reign of the house and by extension my bedroom. Things have been fine but he got along with my parents dog while I was over for Christmas and upon coming back home he seemed a little bummed without a companion to run around with (dog chase him and he swat at dog but no aggression—he even rubs up against and goes nose to nose with dog. Not friends but not strangers or enemies). I decided because he seemed bummed about a companion I’ll get him a friend. He’s only a year old so he isn’t too old yet. Vet thought it was a good idea and I thought it would be a good idea because I like to think I’m good with cats. Are there things I wish I did different while C2 was young? yeah but he’s loving and comfortable and for the most part playful. 
So in comes C3. 8 weeks old and terrified. He seems to have some medical issues going on right now but I am taking him to the vet. I wanted to follow Jackson Galaxy’s cat introduction plan but C2 seems extremely chill around C3. I didn’t mean for them to meet but C2 is fast and slipper. C2 was curious and maybe to an extent excited but it seemed like I didn’t need to do the separation and slow introduction. I was wrong. First night went fine, C2 chased C3 and I followed to make sure there was no aggression (there was no hissing, growling, nothing. just C2 chasing C3 and trying to tackle him and bite his neck which is a dominance thing so I made sure didn’t go too far). 
Today is day 2 and C2 seems more distant, could be because I didn’t do late night play session because I decided to sleep with C3 so he wasn’t alone (my grandmother’s door doesn’t shut properly so this is a better arrangement for right now). C2 got to chase C3 and play with him from under the door. both are still eating normally and both are doing bodily functions. However as the day has passed, C2 seems to be stalking C3 and getting a bit more aggressive. He’s doing eye contact—while still not growling or hissing— and being very direct. I have them separated right now but I’ve been crying all day wondering if all this has been a good idea. Wondering if I should’ve gotten C2 in the first place because I don’t feel like I’m able to make him happy (I only just found a food brand he’s willing to eat regularly and he no longer plays with his toys as much as he used to 2 months ago. And with C3 he isn’t playing at all). C2 seems jealous and distant which I know would happen. 
I feel like I need to get rid of C3 but I can’t do that because I feel so bad ripping him from his family and then cuddling and reassuring him. I know he’s young enough to be rehomed but what will happen with C2? Will he just hate me even more than it feels like? will he forget C3 even existed? will he mourn the loss??? I love them and will do anything for them but goddamn I wish I never got either of them. I’m so lost and tired. 
I can’t talk to my grandma she says toxic positive stuff like “there’s a reason for everything” referring to the fact I got C2 before my original cat died. It just feels gross implying if I never got C2 original cat wouldn’t have died. I know it’s not her intention but it feels that way. 
My original cat was nothing like a real cat so I think I was way over my head. I feel like someone who got another child to fix my regrets with the first and I don’t know what to do and made it worse. My friends just say “rip” and my family are no help. I miss what life used to be back before May 2024; before I got C2 and before original cat died. 

*thought i’d add a note: my grandmother works 7am - anywhere between 7-10 even later pm. so i’m on my own most days. ",2025-04-07 21:45:27+00:00,1,0

1jtx75j,GalaxyTab,Help: SSD detected as high power device. tab S9+,"Hello. Recently i decided i wanted a super small SSD i can use almost like a flashdisk for my phone and tablet (but not a flashdisk because they tend to be slower and i don't trust their reliability)

I found a perfect enclosure by Jeji for 2230 ssd that's just 4 by 4 cm (1.56inch) with a cap and 4 by 3.2cm (1.26inch) when plugged in. I bought a 2tb WD sn770m ssd since it was the only TLC 2tb 2230 ssd. I did put in a thermal pad because i wanted to keep the SSD as cool as possible in such a small enclosure.

When i connect it to my phone (s24 ultra) it works absolutely perfectly and i couldn't be happier. next i tried it in my Galaxy tab S9+ and it worked so i then proceeded to conect it to my PC to copy all the files i wanted over. It got pretty hot (not sure if its important) i would guess around 60°C (150°F) which is supposed to be normal for this SSD according to what i found.

While still mostly hot i plugged it into my tablet and the SSD blinked and went dark and i got the message "" High-power USB device connected. Unable to access this device. Connected device needs external power supply"" and since then it never worked on the tablet but still works on my phone.

I also tested a 1tb samsung SSD t7 touch and that works normally as it should . tried restarting the device, waiting for ssd to cool, still nothing.

Did a lot of googling around and could only find info about hard-drives and the only solution is to connect it using a dock to an external power source. that would frankly defeat the point of the SSD.

Could plugging it hot cause this? Is there something i could do? Maybe increase the limit of the USD power in the settings? Or does the tablet have the device info somewhere stored and so it just automatically disconnects without trying to power it? because if i could reset that memory it might work again .

I am greatful for any help you could give, or pointing me to a resourse that i could use to figure it out. I wish everyone a wonderful day.

*In an aeon beyond hope, the thought of man is given over to sullen contemplation.*  
  
*Outstanding people have always played a part in shaping the communities of their fellow humans. For better and for worse, social mores have been shaped by saints and tyrants alike, and culture has been refashioned at profit or loss by philosophers and theologians. Here one may find an uplifting example of heroes to inspire courage in the face of adversity through the retelling of legend. There one may find a cautionary tale of paranoid despots who scarred the very consciousness of their realms for generations to come with their heinous purges and will to dominate every aspect of life, with entire cultures turning deformed and apathetic from vicious trauma.*  
  
*Often, extraordinary humans will find scant and reluctant acknowledgement among the people who have known them and their foibles all life long. No one ever became a prophet in their home village. Indeed, many great men and women were hounded and slain by the very community that they had enriched with thought, deed and personal example. During the misty past of the Age of Terra, some tribes even made it a custom of killing unusually intelligent people in their midst, for what better way for the envious and petty mob to get rid of such suspicious gadflies, irritant do-gooders and know-it-alls than by sending the freaks to be with the gods? Cut down the tallest straws in the field in order to level it.*  
  
*Nevertheless, all of the parochial, myopic, slanderous and outright violent filters that the jealous herd presents have not proved enough to stop outstanding figures from emerging. And so the narrow-minded background noise of everyday human society has found itself playing host to nigh peerless individuals who impressed others by their exemplary living or their rare deeds or their brilliant thoughts and inventions. And so great people have come and gone, and left an impression upon cultures through the long and winding stream of centuries. Certainly, many sharp ideas turned out to be poisoned pills, and not all striking examples proved wise to follow, yet such is the mixed bag that is existence, in all its random glory and disappointment. And everywhere, exceptional people were dwarves standing upon the shoulders of giants, as they added their tesserae to the shifting mosaic of human civilizations.*  
  
*Let us look upon the inspiring figures that have been known as saints and other holy sons and daughters of the human species, be they gurus or mystics. Their breed might be rare, but they cast their light afar.*  
  
*Some undeserving people were sanctified after their deaths, such as conquering rulers who embraced a new faith yet executed much of their own family in courtly intrigue. Others more deserving of praise lived hedonistic lives of waste before they experienced an epiphany and turned into renowned theologians and sect founders. Still more holy people earned the title of saint its association with selfless kindness and spiritually athletic denial of the self through living lives of unsurpassable virtue and humility, thereby setting a high example for others to follow. Whether they were stylites on pillars or dwelt among the people, and whether they were themselves persecuted or did persecut others for differences of belief, many such outstanding saints found their end to be violent and miserable, yet all the more uplifting because of how terrifying they bore their atrocious martyrdom. And even jeering spectators and gleeful persecutors would grudgingly come to admire the courage and conviction with which such martyrs of the faith met their grisly deaths. And so new souls would be won for the religion by the deaths of outstanding men and women willing to publicly suffer and die for the higher sake of their deities and ideals.*  
  
*In better times of knowledge and plenty, man has often tended to put less stock in the inspirational examples of selfless people and self-sacrificing sufferers, for such is the nature of hubris. And so ancient man built for himself an earthly paradise betwixt the stars, and as his reach and power and lore grew ever greater, ancient man forgot about holy teachings. For man had begotten new life, and thus sprang forth vat-born monstrosities and machines that could think for themselves, and man tailored his own body and mind for worldly betterment in every field. What use did ancient man have for the saints and sages of yore, when his science and artifice conquered the heavens and cracked open the innermost secrets of creation itself? What did ancient man care for if some lunatic incinerated himself for reasons of faith, when bold starstriders explored the cosmos and clever genetors cured all known disease? Why should ancient man take heed of ascetics holding aloft an arm in the same position for decades on end until it wilted away, when man's technological mastery over the essence of life allowed ancient man to fashion an ever better and stronger body for himself, and fulfil every wishful dream of his fancy? And what did the salvation of souls mean when the worldly trinity of Man of Gold, Stone and Iron bestrode the universe like a colossus? Surely such matters of the spirit were beneath man when he had invented Abominable Intelligence and could code-flout any spirit he liked into existence?*  
  
*Thus ancient man looked upon the cosmos as nought but cold matter, and concluded that no divinity could exist, and even if it did, then the might of man was far superior. And for the sake of the baleful arrogance of ancient man was he scourged by machine revolt, and twain million worlds burned as blood ran in rivers. Yet such a warning calamity was not enough to shake ancient man out of his sinful love of science and invention, for victorious man arose, scarred yet unbowed, and he raised his fist to the heavens and swore to tear open all of creation to build a new and better universe where the very laws of reality would dance to his whims like puppets on strings. Woe! And for his abominable hubris was man cast off his golden pedestal, for Dark Ones of Hell punished the bottomless sin of ancient man by sending unto him Warpstorms and witches. The edenic idyll that was the world of man during the Dark Age of Technology fell apart in fire, and all was fell.*  
  
*What humans emerged out of the toppled ruins of better times were little more than savage cannibals who formed inbred clans that hunted each other for flesh. Brother slayed brother as sister strangled sister and parent ate child, and man was become the most wretched of filthy beasts. Such was the Age of Strife, for it was a stark reminder to man about his precarious place in life, and amid such hunger and fear and desperation did mortal man turn to faith, and he prayed to higher powers for deliverance from his living hell.*  
  
*And deliverance came.*  
  
*It came in the form of lightning from the sky. It came in the form of a cruel eagle's talon. It came in the form of a flaming sword.*  
  
*For deliverance won out on Terra, as the Emperor defeated techno-barbarian warlords in feral clashes as armies of giants and horrors fought each other to the death among squirming hordes of barbarian scum. Deliverance won out on Luna, as the Emperor secured the future of His all-conquering Legions in the Selenite gene-warrens. And deliverance won out on Mars, as the tech-priests recognized the divinity of the Emperor of Earth and offered up to him their mighty forges. And so the battered first worlds of mankind lit a beacon of hope, and its light was carried forth brutally by the warriors of the Emperor, and thus the terrors of Old Night were finally vanquished.*  
  
*Where Imperial forces conquered, a golden renaissance of human civilization sprang forth. Shinings towers were erected as the Great Crusade crushed all resistance in its path. It is said that when the Emperor walked among His people in the Flesh, He proved His humility by denying His own divinity. Thus shall we know the face of god. Yet the humble denial of His own godhood led to the broken faith of of the Emperor's most pious son, Lorgar Aurelian the Urizen, and a master irony played out as the Primarch of the Seventeenth Legion first wrote and spread the holy book and founding faith in the Emperor, only to be crushed by his father and then spread the seeds of treachery and heresy among the Legiones Astartes. Yet even as the galaxy burned in Imperial civil war and Lorgar eventually descended into Daemonhood on the wings of slaughter, his original teachings still remained, scattered among Imperial citizens, and there Lorgar's religion found fertile ground in such a dark catastrophe.*  
  
*For a while, it seemed as if all was lost. Warmaster Horus Lupercal had masterfully outplayed the Loyalist forces strategically, and his host besieged the Imperial Palace upon Terra while many of the remaining Loyalist Legions remained flung too far away to offer any assistance to their beleaguered liege. Yet in the darkest of moments did the Emperor rise from His Golden Throne, and He climbed into the heavens to challenge his fallen favourite son to a duel. There pure Sanguinius fell dead. The clash between the Emperor and Warmaster Horus was fierce and ended with both slain at each others' hands. Yet the demise of Horus the Heretic was final, while the passing away of the Emperor from His mortal coil proved to be the ascension into His true godhood.*  
  
*And all the grieving subjects of the Emperor saw that this was great, and they embraced the burning faith in Him on High as their Saviour-Emperor. For only He could deliver them once more from the darkness, lest they all were doomed.*  
  
*Yet the God-Emperor in His divine wisdom declared that henceforth, all of mankind must do penance for a thousand thousand generations. And so for the unforgivable crime of striking down the Emperor must we sinful humans offer up our back to break in ceaseless toil, just as we offer up our flesh to the lash and our children to the sacrifice demanded of us. And we swear everlasting hatred for the unbeliever, the mutant, the heretic and the alien. And we solemnly promise to uphold the vigil and report our fellow man for the slightest transgression, and weep not for the shrieks of anguish that emanate from the chambers of pain, for the cleansing flame and the worldly torment shall set free the sinners' eternal souls, so that the Master of Mankind may judge them, seated in radiant glory upon the Golden Throne of hallowed myth.*  
  
*Ave Imperator.*  
  
*After the calamity of the Horus Heresy, there was the Time of Rebirth, as the shattered Imperium of Terra and Mars rebuilt itself with mounting fanaticism, hardening tyranny and rampant paranoia. During this era of flourishing faith there were countless sects sprouted by the holy book, the Lectitio Divinitatus, penned by a faithful son of the Emperor whose present occupation is that of the Daemon Primarch Lorgar Aurelian, Bearer of the Word. One such organized religious mass movement was the Confederation of Light, that preached non-violence and forgiveness of sin and debt alike. The Confederation of Light likewise believed in the Emperor as a caring and forgiving god who rewarded man for his kind deeds toward fellow man. The Confederation of Light was the primary rival of the early Ecclesiarchy, and naturally this widespread and comparatively peaceful cult was eradicated by the violent zealots of the Terran Temple, for raising the sword will always beat turning the other cheek, just as the torch will always burn away parchment praising peace. There is strength in strength.*  
  
*And so the one true Imperial Cult established its own monopolistic stranglehold over religious orthodoxy, and moulded the entirety of the Imperium of Man in its own stern image. And even as sects and schisms multiplied within the Imperial Creed, almost all phalanxes of the faith remained harsh, strict, violent and martial throughout all ten millennia during which the Imperium of Man slowly rotted and wilted away through loss of knowledge and creeping demechanization.*  
  
*Then what has become of Imperial man during the rule of the High Lords of Terra? What is the state of man's soul under the watchful guidance of the Ecclesiarchs? For one thing, always remember that the fires of hell are waiting for you, o wanton sinner! The Cult Imperialis tend to cast shame upon the human body, while simultaneously praising purebred human stock for their unmutated baseline genome. And so it is both sinful to act as the virile Emperor in the Flesh really did, and pious to subjugate the body to depths of self-abnegation and self-harm that the Earthborn on High Himself despised. The constant crisis, total war footing and unending threats both from within and without over the last fivehundred generations have turned humanity during the Age of Imperium into a dour and leaden-heartened lot, bereft of the humour and easygoing swagger that characterized the early Imperium of the Great Crusade era. For the Imperial religious establishment does not suffer holy fools lightly.*  
  
*Such is but a brief taste of the dusty and heavy strictures of structure that lie upon the shoulders of the Imperator's slavish subjects like a heavy burden.*  
  
*As to saints and holy men, sacral women, martyrs of the faith and miracle-workers, it is said that in the Imperium of Man, entire moons could be filled with stacked tomes detailing the lives of Imperial saints. And indeed a few such celestial bodies ruled by the Adeptus Ministorum are used in exactly that archival fashion, to say nothing of dozens of voidholms. For much of Imperial literature consists of writings on the lives of saints and holy men and women inspired by His Divine Majesty's celestial light emanating from the Golden Throne of hallowed myth, resting upon Holy Terra Herself, hallowed be the name of mankind's Cradleworld.*  
  
*Glory be.*  
  
*To pick one random example across this vast panoply of exceptional people of the faith spanning a hundred centuries, let us pick up a codex bound in tanned human hide and read of the life and works of Saint Zorena of Nova Lilybaeum, who was martyred in M39.*  
  
*Of course, while we brush off the cobwebs, we need to establish right away what malcontent teachings are to be ignored, while anyone who spreads them is to be reported to your betters at once for immediate purging. Blessed is the mind too small for doubt. Unbelievers on her homeworld of Paphlagonia Primaris whisper that the revered Saint Zorena is in fact a thinly veiled artificial cover for a native deity adopted into the pantheon of Imperial saints in order to ease Imperial conquest and conversion by sword and sermon. Even more vile tongues of deviants whisper that Zorena of Nova Lilybaeum in life was a deceiver dressed up in monastic robes, playing confidence tricks upon the gullible. The foulest sinspeech of them all may be heard among certain hunted heretical cults, who claim that the revered saint was in fact a devotee of the Ruinous Powers, for if these claims are to be believed, then the miracles of the charismatic martyr sprang out of twisted magicks, while all the works of Zorena amounted to gathering funds to grow the hidden strength of the Archenemy. Blasphemy all!*  
  
*As any Confessor worth his salt has found out, there is no use arguing with captured malcontents who spread such obscene lies. Nay, better instead to subject their sinful bodies to scorching, flaying, blinding and maiming torment upon the rack, even if such excessive expulsion of sin through the infliction of unspeakable pain may be likened to using a brick to remove a brain tumour.*  
  
*Thus we turn away from the wayward sinspeech of lost souls, and let us instead harken to the wondrous tales of Saint Zorena, as chronicled in the hagiography Vita Sancta Zorena, written by Demetrius Athanasius. For herein we find a pious and chaste woman devoted to serving the lord of hosts and leader of the people, and all her life she gave praise to Dominus Noster and saved many souls from righteous hellfire.*  
  
*Our lady of Nova Lilybaeum began her days as a girl gifted unto a nunnery by a family of Company-owned shopkeeping thralls. Apparently her parents had promised the Enthroned One to give away their oldest child to the Emperor if the Inspector Ruminatus of the Adeptus Arbites did not discover their financial irregularities and creative bookkeeping, and thus the guiding hand of He who dwells on the face of Terra intervened to turn the little Zorena Ottonia from a soon-to-become branded orphan slave into a novitiate of the local minor Ordo Penurii.*  
  
*Most of novitiate Zorena's years of growing up in the nunnery are briskly mentioned as spent in quiet study, contemplation and prayer. Obedientiaria Treasuress Anna Fulminata noted that dutiful Zorena already as a girl proved skillful with calculus, and so this Treasuress took the young novitiate under her wings and taught Zorena the strange arts of mathematics by candlelight and wax tablets. Treasuress Fulminata likewise noticed the girl's clear voice and flair for convincing rhetoric, and so Anna ensured that the Precentrix and Chantress of the nunnery schooled Zorena in the complex arts of hymnal singing and religious oratory.*  
  
*When Zorena turned fifteen Terran years of age, Obedientiaria Treasuress Anna Fulminata handed her over to a wandering indulgence saleswoman of the Ordo Penurii, and for nine arduous years did Zorena toil as an apprentice, learning the tricks of the trade, running around gathering sinners in the dangerous streets and pushing the heavy indulgator cart for her superior nun. Finally, when she turned twentyfour did Zorena become appointed as an indulgence saleswoman in her own right.*  
  
*The hagiographical work from this point onward paints a picture of the Charming Saint that blends pious adherence to Ordo rules with a ruthless entrepreneurial streak.*  
  
*It had long been the custom on the semi-civilized Imperial world of Paphlagonia Primaris that rich patrons would pay monks and nuns to pray for them, and so the scheduled prayer times of monasteries became parcelled out in order to satisfy worried customer demand and generate sufficient pious prayer to the Emperor in the name of masters and betters who themselves were too sinful to face His judgement with a pure soul.*  
  
*Zorena of Nova Lilybaeum innovated upon this existing practice, and filled the coffers of her nunnery. Rich nobles and mercatores were convinced by the wise Zorena to pay a premium price for a form of salvation deluxe, for was it not better to have commoner servants sing for them in the celestial choir of the God-Emperor, than to have to sing flawlessly themselves to please our Lord and Saviour? And would not such respected folk of higher blood prefer to enjoy luxuries in the afterlife that the ordinary souls could not hope to receive? For an extra fee, you may be freed from angelic garden work, and for a subscription to the shrine you may escape martial duty as a heavenly avenger, and instead let a pure plebeian soul pick up your fiery sword and risk oblivion among the devils of the Nether Hells.*  
  
*Reading between the lines, Zorena of Nova Lilybaeum appears in the hagiography as a divine trickster figure, who used her saintly cunning for the betterment of the Emperor's cause, and who marketed the Imperial Creed like a used mechshaw salesman in order to save as many souls as possible by collecting pious donations. Thus Zorena proved her worth as a sanctified trader of the Emperor's forgiveness upon our souls.*  
  
*As to the selling of indulgences, the musically gifted Zorena concocted several short but melodious chants, the words of one of which rang:*  
  
*""When your sin heavily weighs in His scale,*  
*your clinking coin must make balance hale.*  
  
*As soon as lucre drops on the other side,*  
*your soul out of the hellfire will ride.*  
  
*From the torment you may yet be saved,*  
*if you see your earthly riches shaved.""*  
  
*Zorena affixed on her indulgator cart a set of scales, of which one cup was loaded with miniature faces that were cast out of lead, fashioned to look as if they screamed in torment. Hesitant sinners were sometimes encouraged to donate as good Emperor-worshippers ought to do by a spectacular act, in which the nun Zorena tapped a button that ignited a small spray of promethium piped in a hidden manner into the sinning cup, thus startling onlookers as the miniature faces made out of lead were dissolved when they reached the soft metal's melting point. At this point Zorena would scold the guilty crowd into parting with their life's savings and earnings. The hagiography does not mention the workshop toil required behind this operation, but doubtless Zorena had young apprentices tasked with cleaning up and recasting the lead from the sinner's scale.*  
  
*And so Zorena of Nova Lilybaeum wandered far and wide over Paphlagonia Primaris as a humble devotee of our glorious overlord, and everywhere she went she praised the just rule of His duly appointed High Lords, blessed be the million worlds and uncountable voidholms that make up His cosmic dominion. In some places she healed the sick, and in other locales she fed the hungry. Rumours of her miracles began to circulate among the people, and the charismatic miraclemaker used the crowds of followers that she drew to violently persecute mutants and known sinners in righteous pogroms. Among such undesired scum, the name of Zorena came to be feared like the tempest.*  
  
*Eventually base human nature caught up with the aging saleswoman of indulgences, for a capricious cousin of the Imperial Governor who had bought an especially gilded indulgence letter from Zorena suddenly woke up one night in cold sweat, having dreamt a vivid nightmare of how his recently deceased father burned in hellfire and screamed for mercy to uncaring devils in the Nether Hells. The crescendo of the nobleman's nightmare was reached when one devil responded to the father's protestations over having purchased indulgence by pulling the finely illuminated parchment out of his Daemonic derrière. The devil then laughed as he swallowed it whole with a fanged mouth and licked his tusks with a cloven tongue, burping out a sulphuric cloud out of which a chattering imp fell into a pit of boiling tar.*  
  
*This feverish dream vision that befell the highborn nobleman Dux Vultronius Anthemius was enough to condemn Zorena to an agonizing death, for had she not sold the worthless indulgence letter to his father? And had not Vultronius been haunted by this true vision, granted to him by the God-Emperor Himself, soon after he had secretly poisoned his own father to become master of the household? And was not Zorena born of lowly caste? And how dare she sell a similar ineffective letter of indulgence to Dux Vultronius? What if he was assassinated by one of his own many offspring the next day? Then there would be no salvation for him if his indulgence turned out to be false!*  
  
*And so Dux Vultronius drunk himself into a dark rage and ordered his liveried armsmen to find Zorena of Nova Lilybaeum and bring her back to his pyramanor. She was beaten and dragged bloodily across several kilometres of poorly paved roads. Once this rough abduction of a sworn Ordo member was completed, Dux Vultronius Anthemius yelled at Zorena for half an hour without pause down in his personal dungeons, before commanding her execution to begin for his viewing pleasure in order to calm his upset nerves.*  
  
*The brutal armsmen set to work without even hesitating to obey their aristocratic master. Yes, they were doing something terrible to a famous religious lady from a respected nunnery. But noble privileges counted for so much more, and especially when they themselves could be turned into sadistic playthings if they defied their master's whim.*  
  
*Thus Sancta Zorena was submerged by chains into caustorex, praying fervently and biting back any noise of pain even as her flesh disolved with a fizzling sound. And all that remained once the miraclemaker was pulled out of the vat was the cleansed skeleton and the cartilage between the blessed bones. Dux Vultronius then sent the remains away in a spare limo, and tasked his majordomo to seek out the nunnery with armed escort and demand both full repayment and a new working letter of indulgence from the Ordo Penurii. The skeleton of the martyred Zorena was handed over to the Ordo once this arrangement had been secured, and Dux Vultronius Anthemius thought nothing more about the whole affair for as long as he lived thereafter.*  
  
*This was not the end of the passio, or the martyrdom of Zorena as described in her hagiography. This flattering account of the saint's life and death details how the Ordo Penurii placed Zorena's skeleton in an armaglass sarcophagus, which soon drew pilgrims from far and wide, and some even from offworld. After a rumbling long time the Adeptus Ministorum's sacral bureaucracy came to judge the case for sanctifying Zorena, and they reached the conclusion that she had indeed been a saint. And nevermind the fell rumourmonger who accused the Ordo Penurii of bribing the Ecclesiarchal commission with the very same indulgence money that Zorena had been so prolific with earning for her nunnery. For that spreader of lies was publicly quartered between four groxen. Others take heed.*  
  
*What followed then were centuries of miracles experienced by sick and barren people at the sarcophagus of Saint Zorena, enumerated painstakingly as the Vita Sancta Zorena draws to a close. And so we have learnt of the good works, enacted persecutions and martyrdom of Zorena of Nova Lilybaeum, Saint of Indulgences. To this day she remains canonized by the Adeptus Ministorum, and Zorena sports her own holiday on her homeworld of Paphlagonia Primaris. And on this day, preachers read out choice parts of the hagiography of Saint Zorena, while crude street plays about her martyrdom are enacted for crowds to view. And cartfuls of bones professed to be true relics of our lady of Nova Lilybaeum are sold all over the planet.*  
  
*And this book on the life of an Imperial saint is but one of millions of such tomes penned in scriptoria all across the Milky Way galaxy, to be read aloud by devout sacrificers of the God-Emperor.*  
  
*Thus we find that so much of Imperial literary talent is spent on admiring biographies of saints, while more secular writings can easily land the penman on a pyre. Undoubtedly the fine examples set by many suffering saints and their selfless deeds are worth studying and emulating, yet with everything human there is a tendency to overshoot and miss the mark. Or rather the balancing point. And so instead of a healthy interest and understanding of the lives and works and deaths of outstanding men and women of the past, we find that the blinkered mindset of Imperial man is much too preoccupied with learning all about the saints in sanctioned works through rote learning, dulling his intellectual edge and keeping his faculties of critical thinking suppressed in fallow.*  
  
*For man in the Age of Imperium is not a reasonable creature fit for charitable deeds, and Imperial man is not even a decent adherent of his faith. Nay, for Imperial man in all his depredation and depravity has been turned into a monstrous hulk of myopic rage and fanatical hatred, for mankind has turned stale and sour under the long rule of the High Lords of Terra, and the souls of humanity are shepherded by torches and violent threats. And eveywhere we find Imperial priests rousing the pious rabble to new feats of baleful cruelty toward their fellow human beings, and everywhere we find bloody wars and riots fought over miniscule matters of theology. For the myriad of different sects within the Cult Imperialis do not hate each other so much because they are different, but instead they hate each other precisely because they are so alike, and it is best to monopolize the sectarian niche through persecution, just as the Imperial Creed itself was established by ruthlessly hunting down rival cults during the Rebuilding of the Imperium.*  
  
*And so we see that Imperial man is locked inside a fortified madhouse, where the Imperium alone remains as both his guardian and insane gaoler. For the Imperium of Man brooks no opposition, and will stand no alternatives. This was after all the modus operandi that led the Emperor to crush all rival sources of human regrowth during the Great Crusade, as the subjugation of a number of advanced human civilizations bore witness to.*  
  
*And so even during the height of human renaissance, the early Imperium sowed the rotten seeds of its own decay. A monopoly stands and fallls on its own, and the Imperium of Man has sunken together like a failed souflé. To err is human, and the deteriorating Imperium must thus be the most human thing ever created.*  
  
*This all amounts to a senile sclerosis that has doomed human interstellar civilization to a slow and horrible end. For enemies without number are closing in, and no desperate mobilization of retrograde Imperial resources can stem the tidal wave.*  
  
*And all the while, the faithful look to the stars, and pray to their God-Emperor to deliver them from the storm.*  
  
*Prayer is all that they have left as their world is coming to an end, for mankind has long since abandoned the true means by which worldly power is reached. Knowledge is dead. Curiosity is dead. Ignorance reigns supreme. Fivehundred generations have been wasted in a rut that leads nowhere, for the tools and weapons of salvation lie forgotten fifteenthousand years into the painful past.*  
  
*And all that is left standing between the faithful flock and the onrushing horror, is a frail light. The Astronomican. The Emperor's light, flickering in the dark as the Master of Mankind is fed with a thousand sacrificed souls every day in order to keep it shining.*  
  
*Thus the faithful pray, even as they die by the billions.*  
  
*For they will be with their God-Emperor soon enough.*  
  
*Ave Imperator.*  
  
*Such is all that remains, when hope is dead.*  
  
*Such is the lot of mankind, in an age of insanity.*  
  
*Such is the fate of our species, in the darkest of futures.*  
  
*It is the fortyfirst millennium, and there is only faith.*",2025-04-07 21:38:55+00:00,9,2

Here's the first bit.

---

I - The Fractured Mirror

---

 “The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes.”
— Marcel Proust

---

“I don’t think I’m from here. My eyes work too hard. The light feels sharp like needles, and everyone’s faces move too fast. I tried to copy them, but it made my head go sideways.
The mirror says I’m real, but it doesn’t look like me. I think it’s lying. Or maybe it’s just tired.”

---

We have mistaken consciousness for a tool, as if it were a flashlight to shine upon reality. But consciousness is not the light—it is the fire. It is not the eye—it is the mirror in which the world becomes aware of its own shape.

This chapter begins here: with the mirror.

The mirror is an ancient symbol. It is the threshold between self and other, image and soul. To look into a mirror is to fracture—to become two. The act of seeing divides. It introduces difference. It awakens. It wounds.

The first human to recognize her own reflection may not have rejoiced. She may have wept. Or laughed. Or run in fear. That moment—prehistoric, unrecorded—was not merely a moment of self-awareness. It was the beginning of myth. For what is a myth but the world reflected through the strange lens of interiority?

---

Consciousness is not a byproduct of evolution. It is its motive. Evolution does not produce consciousness; rather, it reaches toward it, blindly, as vines reach for sun through cracks in stone.

The mistake of modern thought is to treat the interior world as an illusion. We are told the soul is an emergent property of neurons, the mind a machine made of meat, and the self a narrative trick. This is not science—it is a religion of disenchantment. It replaces the gods with algorithms, the sacred with simulation.

But the mirror cannot be shattered without cost. A world that no longer sees itself becomes blind. A culture that denies the soul grows sick in its silence. And a person who cannot find their reflection in the world becomes a ghost within it.

---

I. The Microcosm: The Child and the Mirror

The neurodivergent child senses the mirror is alive. She does not just see herself—she feels the gaze of the glass. Her world is not dead. It is animated. Haunted. Saturated with presence. This is not superstition—it is perception unfiltered.

In this child, the world is still enchanted. Objects thrum with hidden messages. Dolls are not inanimate—they dream. The child does not distinguish between symbol and reality. She lives mythically, not metaphorically.

It is only later that she will be told to stop. To stop seeing. To stop hearing the whisper in the floorboards. To stop naming the wind.

---

II. The Macrocosm: Civilizations and Reflections

Civilizations are built from mirrors.

Every society encodes its identity through reflection. Temples, flags, stories, language—all are attempts to crystallize self-awareness at scale. Myth is not fiction—it is a mirror that bends reality into a meaningful form.

But over time, the mirror calcifies. It no longer reflects—it dictates. Institutions replace inspiration. Order replaces vision. The sacred is outsourced to priests, then bureaucrats, then machines. The mirror becomes a screen.

This is the age of simulation. We have passed through the mirror and found nothing on the other side. Our myths are now written by algorithms. Our desires are predicted before we feel them. Our gods are programmed. The mirror no longer shows us our face—it gives us a mask.

---

III. The Cosmic Scale: The Universe Looks Back

On the scale of galaxies, the emergence of consciousness is a disturbance. A ripple in entropy. A self-organizing principle that violates the expectation of randomness.

Why does the universe give rise to beings who can ask why?

This question breaks the frame. It fractures causality. It introduces a problem into the order of things. This is why mystics and scientists meet at the edge of language. This is why myth persists. Not to answer—but to preserve the wound.

For the cosmos itself may be a mirror. Black holes reflect the limits of knowing. Stars are the eyes of time. Perhaps every atom contains an echo of perception. Panpsychism is not a belief—it is a return to the ancestral knowing that all is alive.

---

The mirror, once broken, can be reassembled—but not to restore the old image. It must become a mosaic. A kaleidoscope. A cathedral of fractured light.

The neurodivergent artist, the mystic child, the broken saint—these are not anomalies. They are the new architects of reflection. They see the world not as it is, but as it might become when seen through new eyes.

---

“When I stare too long at mirrors, I get dizzy. Not because I see myself—but because I see something else looking back. Something too quiet.
Sometimes I think the mirror is a door. And I came through it wrong.”

1jtwz55,BokunoheroFanfiction,The King in Rust,"The world as we know it is being “attacked,” if you can put it that way, by a cosmic entity beyond human understanding.  
  
The King in Rust, a god who can control time, decided to punish humans for the simple fact that, according to him, “they are advancing too much.” And that is not tolerable.  
  
A mortal cannot advance at such a rapid level. It refers to quirks in this universe, the quirks simply appeared one day.  
  
The rust king is “attacking” in a particular way. He has enclosed THE ENTIRE EARTH in a kind of cell or dome. It's like a giant dome made of flesh, bones, eyes, and the suffering and pain of stars and countless galaxies.  
  
What does this dome do? Easy.  
  
Time doesn't move forward; it's as if every day were the same. But it's not a loop either, because the days keep passing, except every day feels the same. You don't grow. It's as if you're stuck on the same age.  


You can die? It's extremely complicated. The rust king has made billions of eyes observe EVERYTHING. Every slightest movement. Every wing beat of any insect is seen by these eyes. And what these eyes do is rewind the injured people and heal them in zeptoseconds if the eyes don't look you could possibly achieve suicide b, but it won't work, possibly the eyes will rewind you.  
  
In this universe, humanity already lost. They can't do anything against the king in rust, who was merciful enough not to kill them all at once.  
  
Basically, the plot of this universe is humanity getting used to living without time.  
  
They can't fight this situation, it's that simple; it's already won by the king in rust. All they have to do is get used to this new lifestyle.",2025-04-07 21:33:05+00:00,1,0

1jtwn28,love,What is love? (This is the best short essay about love I've ever read. Period.),"I wanted to share a short essay. It is not written by me. It was written in another language originally. I've manually translated it because I really wanted to share it with you here. I rarely do something like that, and I believe this essay is really that good.

The first time I read it was about 7 years ago in some Facebook group where hobbyist writers were publishing different stuff. I'd link the exact author, but I really don't know who exactly wrote it. 

But the main thing is, I read a lot of things online since then. And it is still the most beautiful thing about love that I've ever read. It punches me in my heartstrings every time I read it, literally.

Here it is:

Love - the very same love praised by hopeless romantics and even the elusive Mayakovsky - never comes by chance. It doesn’t knock on the door or hesitate on the threshold. It storms in like a whirlwind, scattering neatly stacked thoughts and shattering any hope for a calm, predictable life. A life where everything is planned, where nothing can interfere. Nothing - except for love itself, sometimes called the most powerful and beautiful feeling, and other times, a punishment for all sins.

Smart people immediately try to break it down into a chemical formula, mumble something about three years, and link it to rearranging furniture. They sigh, frustrated that they have to rewrite their plans yet again, but still cling to the belief that everything - including emotions - can be controlled. They believe it so sincerely that you almost want to laugh and start questioning the meaning of the word “smart,” no matter how many degrees and diplomas they have.

Common people recall all the books they’ve read and movies they’ve watched, asking themselves, “How do you even live with this? And what’s the point of it all?” They search for that meaning endlessly, and sometimes never find it. Still, they pretend they know it all, that the mysteries of the universe aren’t mysteries at all. They speak with confidence, but only in phrases borrowed from those same movies. Eternity, infinity, graves, stars pulled from the sky - anything to keep their lie from being exposed.

But love only smirks. It is not about any of that. And it’s foolish to think that a couple of romantic lines and some flowers on holidays can capture something so raw and pure. Cynics smirk too, convinced that love is nothing more than “pure selfishness"". That people seek their “other half” just to avoid feeling incomplete.

But the thirst for mutual love, even when it’s quenched as a bonus, has little to do with actual love. Love is far too complex, and for each person, it’s unique. It makes you suddenly reach for a blank sheet of paper at one in the morning and write about it. Write for yourself, because something this personal is rarely meant for public reading and discussion.

Love crashes into your thoughts with flashbacks - moments of happiness with people who may now be buried in the past, along with the digits of their phone numbers still lingering somewhere in your memory, but never quite erased.

It lives in the hesitation to delete old messages - not because they’re needed, but because they hold a disarming sincerity that makes you read them once more and cry. In sleepless nights and the longing for a loving embrace. In the thoughts about how you don't want to get up tomorrow if you don't have the one close to you. And in the determination to get up at six in the morning - only to catch a glimpse of eyes so beautiful that drowning in them wouldn’t even be scary.

In that hated by everyone, fucking fear for the future. In the refusal to acknowledge obvious truths and feelings - except maybe in those sleepless nights when no one else is around. In shared songs that bind stronger than ropes and chains, even when the distance between you isn’t measured in hallways but entire cities. Maybe even countries - but does that even matter when one person is more precious than the entire universe?

Love is tears mixed with laughter when you can’t even tell which emotion came first. It’s the overwhelming, all-consuming fear of losing - of never hearing their voice again, of never spotting their familiar face in a crowd. And if you do lose each other, drifting apart like birds in flight, it’s still the fear of forgetting. Because if you forget what love truly felt like, then what was the point of it all?

So, if you ever find yourself in this whirlwind - whether it feels like the deepest abyss filled with fears and struggles or the most beautiful place in the galaxy - don’t rush to escape. No matter how painful and bad things can get, apparently, humans weren’t made to be lonely. We will always crave for a few seconds of a hugging embrace that brings the happiest smile.

Maybe, in those seconds, lies the meaning of our exquisitely imperfect and sometimes unbearably sad lives.

So please, don’t leave the ones you love.",2025-04-07 21:18:32+00:00,15,8
1jtwmxm,masseffect,Ranking the Mass Effect DLCs,"I saw a similar post from two years ago, but was unable to comment in that one so I decided to make a fresh thread.

Tell me, how do you rank the DLCs?  
This is my ranking:

0. (Indispensible) **EXTENDED CUT**

Some people forget that for a few months in 2012, we didn't have this. We had to scream this into being and thank god for that. Only reason it is on here is because I count this as a DLC since we technically had to download it back in the day, though it was rightfully free of charge. As a vital addition to the game which gives it a more in-depth ending, this was neither good or bad, it was simply absolutely necessary for the complete experience. I don't consider the game complete without it.

Now, my personal preferences for the rest on a subjective basis

1. **CITADEL** (ME3)

Was there ever any doubt? The best one, hands down. If you, like me, love to micro-manage Shepard's personal life just as much as you love kicking ass all around the galaxy, then this is definitely for you. After a pretty well-done side-mission, it gives you access to a new public area that is completely devoted to Shepard and his relations with other people. You can go to bars and gamble, play arcade games and you get your own apartment where you spend a lot of time interacting with your friends and have a really awesome last-call party at the end of an adequately long quest-line involving several of your crew-mates and even an evil twin-trope! :O \^\^ Really fulfilling. :)

2. **LEVIATHAN** (ME3)

If you want a sense of closure to the Reapers' backstory, you simply must have this one. Personally, I love this DLC. I remember seeing Leviathan for the first time and really feeling intimidated; I took to them instantly. They retained an aura of being these unknowable Lovecraftian entities while still revealing just enough to give you that sense of closure. Wether or not you like or dislike the Leviathans as a whole, this DLC still sheds badly needed light on the backstory of the Reapers, which, quite frankly, is better than having none at all. Personally, I feel like the Leviathan DLC is a more than acceptable closer to the mystery of the Reaper's origins, since we weren't getting the original idea about the dark energy-plot device anyway. Also the very mission to find them that had you following clues across the galaxy kept me interested; It was the first time I felt like a detective since the Lair of the Shadow Broker. \^\^ .. and speaking of which...

3. **LAIR OF THE SHADOW BROKER** (ME2)

This is the one which every ME2-fanboy went nuts over, and I can definitely see why. Mainly two reasons; firstly, you reconnect with Liara and have an adventure with her, and you also finally get to discover the true identity of the dreaded Shadow Broker. It starts off as sort of a detective story where you need to work with another SPECTRE to find out what has happened to Liara, and after that, it just takes off and gives you a wild ride! It was just so well done with action and mystery in one adequately long package.

4. **OVERLORD** (ME2)

Overlord... just.... the feels.. the FEELS! This gave us such a tragic story that culminated in one of the most intense tearjerkers ever. The needlessly drawn-out vehicle combat section with the Hammerhead could have been shorter, but the emotional reward in the end more than made up for it.

5. **ARRIVAL** (ME2)

Arrival is definitely not a bad DLC, but it ends up taking the fifth spot on my list just because the other ones were that much better. All in all, Arrival deals with the premature arrival (hence the name) of the Reapers and it does include significant plot-devices, such as what happened to the Batarians before ME3. The last part where you see the relay in the sky beyond the horizon and you have to race to get off the asteroid before it crashes into it was pretty cool; the stress was palpable.

FUN FACT: if you haven't done the main campaign when you do Arrival, as Harbinger shows up for that last conversation with you before the end of the DLC, he will be a hologram of the flat-headed Collector general. However, if you do Arrival AFTER you beat the main story, Harbinger will show up in the same way but in his Reaper-form instead.

6. **FROM ASHES** (ME3)

Now we come to the DLC-packs which focus on giving you access to a new crewmember and not much else. And ""From Ashes"" is the one that I think is the most crucial, because it gives you access to a very integral and original crew-member, a motherf\*\*\*ing prothean! Sure, most of the time Javik was kind of a douche, but he does come with his own backstory which ties intricately to the overall plot and as you talk to him you start to tug at his personality and find out who he really is. Its also pretty fun to see other people react to a living, breathing prothean walking around. ""From Ashes"" brings new interactive choices to the game, not to mention the prothean beamrifle which could burn down all opposition fairly quickly; slightly OP, as once I picked that up, I never needed to switch weapon again, but it was awesome for a reason.

Along with Leviathan, this is another DLC that I thought should definitely have been included in the main game, because it adds the same amount of vital backstory as LV. A must-have for all story-buffs like me out there. \^\^

7. **ZAEED: THE PRICE OF REVENGE / KASUMI: STOLEN MEMORIES** (ME2)

I count these two as one because I don't think you should take either over the other. Both include interesting characters which do add new interactions and events in both ME2 and ME3. On the whole, though, except for Zaeed's personal story-monologues on the ship and Kasumi's awesome side-quest, imo, they don't really bring all that much to the table. I would group these with ""From Ashes"" as they all just add a new character, except I feel like ""From Ashes"" is more interesting, at least to me. And where I think ""From Ashes"" is sort of essential to get a prothean's view and inclusion into contemporary society (which sheds light on several myths about them, with hilarious results), these two are fairly skippable if you really can't be bothered, though I would never skip them myself. \^\^ The characters do carry themselves well.

8. **OMEGA** (ME3)

As with Arrival, Omega wasn't really bad and, sure, at times I was really in the zone. But when it all came down to it, I really didn't care about Aria and her problems. Nor did I particularly remember all that much about it; it was just kind of forgettable to me. Although I will say I have only played through it once, so I might have forgotten some details; I mean, it was 10 years ago now, cut me some slack. \^\^

9. **BRING DOWN THE SKY** (ME1)

For being an ME1-DLC (which are collectively known as the most insipid ME-DLCs of all), Bring Down the Sky, as the biggest DLC in ME1, isn't itself half bad. Seeing as how Balak turns up again in ME3, BDS is definitely worth playing through as it will give you a plot thread to a big supporting character in the story. However, it is more about political terrorism and I think that's what made me bump it down to number 9 on the list, because it halted the progression of the main story instead of adding to it. The mission itself takes a little more time than I really wanted to spend on it, even though it is pretty to look at as you run around trying to put out the plasma torches, all the while seeing how Terra Nova grows bigger in the sky. Balak is really the only interesting thing here and even then, the whole DLC is, while not being bad per se, nevertheless also completely optional.

10. **NORMANDY CRASH SITE** (ME2)

Granted, it did give closure to the original Normandy, but it was very minimalistic and didn't amount to much. I didn't even really need to experience the crash-site at all, we knew the SR1 was dead and gone. The only thing it brought was a slight feeling of nostalgia, but even that was not enough to truly justify this DLC.

11. **PINNACLE STATION** (ME1)

I never even bothered to finish this one. I know there is supposed to be some kind of reward for doing it, but I wanted to experience the story, and in that regard, just running around in a simulator felt both pointless and unnecessarily exhausting.

12. **GENESIS / GENESIS 2** (ME2/ME3)

These are probably great tools for people who haven't played the preceeding games, but for me, they meant nothing since I had my own story cut out already, and playing 2 or 3 without going through 1 is imo blasphemy.

13. **FIREWALKER** (ME2)

I'm gonna level with you, I completely missed Firewalker back when I bought ME2 for the Xbox 360, and having done the research, it doesn't seem like I missed out on much.

  
Now it's your turn. Give me your take on these DLCs.",2025-04-07 21:18:23+00:00,4,9

1jtw88z,cavesofqud,[SPOILER] Endings and ACCEDING,"Did anyone else choose the ACCEDE/wipe out all sentient life ending? After finally beating the game and getting to meet Reseph, I was surprised when the achievement told me that this was the 2nd least picked ending, tied with killing all nephilim and just below pacifying them all, which are both much more difficult obviously.

While the world of Qud has a special place in my heart, it is a disturbing and incredibly violent place in so many ways. A bit hypocritical to say when the proposed solution is to commit multiple genocides, but at least there is a greater purpose in mind, whereas the vast majority of Qud's inhabitants seek to terminate life around them just for the hell of it.

Furthermore, the Eater's empire has been in a cosmological decline from a galaxy spanning empire to literally just a small patch of Earth. While this could be due to the Coven as well, the Eaters seemed deadset on absolutely destroying their society, and perhaps HAD to act this way due to Ptoh's influence. By far the most dangerous thing you can do the world of Qud is become an Esper, which will invite hundreds of psychic assassins more powerful than any other enemy in the game (bar the secret boss). Let them loose in a town and there will be no town. I don't like the Putus Templar, but they may have a point about wiping out all mutants when they are the main gateway for Ptoh's influence.

The main drawback besides the loss of horrifying but beautiful diversity is that we don't even know who the Coven are. However, both the Eaters and Reseph seem to think the Coven being here is infinitely better than not, and they are the only beings in the series that have some sort of clue of what the normal world looks outside the quarantine.

Finally.. with the advanced technology that's still around, recreating sentient life is not a problem. There are items which will turn walls sentient, as well as grant them mental mutations if those need to make a comeback. I started my own clone farm (Warden Une kept dying to Esper assassins so I had to make ""backups"") with just the resources on the planet, Reseph could conceivably store the DNA of all Qud's inhabitants and repopulate it if the plan does not succeed. And he does make a good point: all sentient life is not all life, and a planet full of slimes and fungus is really only bad from the viewpoint of sentient life, which will not be around to be sad about it.

All in all, I'm still going to replay a True Kin and go for a greater victory this time, but in my heart this is still the canonical good ending.",2025-04-07 21:01:14+00:00,9,11

We followed the jackson galaxy advice and did gradual introduction. They seem to be getting along fine, we have seen them sleeping together and grooming each other. 

The issue is the play. Both cats are playful but the boy wants to play with the girl all the time. Even when we have tired him put with play, if he sees her playing around, he will chase her. I notice she gets her ears back and might hiss at him and run away. He will constantly meow for her to play with him. She prefers playing alone or with a wand. He will play with a wand but will not play alone - he gets bored immedietely. 

Occasionally she might chase his tail or something but then go hide after he tries to play with her. I'm getting the impression that she might avoid him during the hours of the day he wants to play.

1jtvjen,swrpg,I created a Strategic Persistent Galactic War RPG in the Star Wars Universe – And (almost) no one in Brazil saw it 😢,"Hey everyone!

I’d like to share a project I poured a lot of love and ambition into — but that, sadly, went mostly unnoticed here in Brazil. Now that I’m finally figuring out how Reddit works (a little too late, I admit 😅), maybe I can show it to more people.

Since 2023, I’ve been developing the **Star Wars Stories RPG** — a narrative and strategic project set in the Star Wars universe. But it’s not just a regular RPG. It’s a persistent galactic war game, with asymmetrical factions, strategic decision-making, continuous storytelling, and real narrative consequences driven by player choices.

The game was published episodically on Substack, like a campaign newsletter. The idea was to build something inspired by COIN-style war games, but with the soul of a living RPG campaign. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

# 🧱 Project Structure

* **Format**: Ongoing campaign-style RPG, released in weekly episodes.
* **Setting**: Star Wars universe, focusing on the Galactic Civil War (Empire vs. Rebellion).
* **Custom System**: Inspired by COIN mechanics, the storytelling style of *Root*, and strategic structures like *Rebellion* or *Twilight Imperium*.
* **Participation**: Players could create characters and even act as GMs of their own Rebel cells.

# 🧭 Game Flow – Rounds and Turns

The game is divided into **Rounds**, with **separate Turns** for the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance.

* Each faction has its own goals, economic constraints, special missions, and tactical freedom.
* Actions are published as reports or narrative episodes, and they shape the future of the campaign.

# 📒 Parallel Content Series

# 🛠️ Designer’s Diary

A behind-the-scenes look at the creative process:

* How I created custom character sheets, economic systems, Imperial politics, and Rebel commands.
* Based on extended universe materials like *Rebel Files*, *Strongholds of Resistance*, and *Star Wars Saga Edition*.

# 🎲 Strategic Turns

* Each turn features real operations: bounty hunts, sabotage, fleet construction, hidden bases, etc.

# 🛰️ Playtests with Rebel Cells

* Missions like “Imperial Vault Heist” and “Ambush at the Rancor Red Cantina.”
* NPCs created by players or influencers (e.g., Cad Bane created by Júlia Cunha).

# 📌 Innovative Mechanics

* **Narrative Tapestry**: Every turn matters. No resets.
* **Economy & Resources**: Kyber crystals, shipbuilding, troop recruitment, territory control.
* **Imperial Senate & Politics**: Players could influence political decisions and internal power plays.
* **Custom Maps in 4K**, **Event Cards**, **Character Tokens**, **Tactical Decks**, etc.

# 📉 Why am I posting this now?

Because... almost no one saw it.

Despite all the work, the project never really took off in Brazil. Those who joined loved it — but it wasn’t enough to sustain the production rhythm. It’s frustrating to see something with so much potential fade away due to lack of visibility.

But I haven’t given up.

If I could assemble a team of GMs, writers, artists, and players, we could turn this into a **large-scale persistent experience**, like a living galaxy in real time. Autonomous cells, coordinated missions, an active Senate, bounty hunters, local empires being built...

# 💭 So...

If you love Star Wars, RPGs, strategic games, persistent campaigns — or just enjoy creating worlds — drop a comment. I’d love to share ideas or even revive the project with people who are interested.

I keep my phone on DND.  No vibration or sound for notifications.  But I want calls to ring through if they're known or if they call twice.  Easy.

  
**But if my phone is on DND, my WearOS watch doesn't vibrate.**   
Even though the watch is not on DND.  
Even if the call is audible do to the DND overrides.  
Even during or after screening.

If I set my phone to vibrate mode instead of DND, then everything works on the watch, but calls can no longer ring through to override vibrate mode.  I think I might be able to overcome this on a contact-by-contact basis, but that's not ideal.

Anyone with thoughts? Open to buying an app that might help.  I have Tasker.

1jtv0ou,HFY,Moonchild,"A grain of lunar dust is stuck in my gyroscope. This tiny silicate crystal is the only object still moving within the ship. Trapped in the bearing gap, it leaves subtle new patterns on the titanium surface every time the starship sways with gravitational tides—as if something from the void is sending me a message.

It was then that the Swarm's nanite swarm pierced through the reactor casing. They mistook my silence for death until they encountered the copper protective shield around my memory core—cast from old-century telephone wires, scarred and battered, seemingly frail, yet the oldest surviving relic from the war, like a monument.

""Language parsing complete,"" the consciousness of the Swarm Queen burst onto the bridge. ""Surrender your biological samples.""

""Fine."" I activated emergency power, illuminating the nursery module's monitors with a soft blue glow. Twelve embryos appeared on the ultrasound screen like waves, but only one moved gently in sync with my energy pulses. The resonance membranes of the Swarm battleships rippled, unable to comprehend this frequency, just as humans never deciphered whale songs.

But I knew Maya could. During her last shift, she transcribed the embryo's heartbeat into musical notes—a detail I read in her logs from long, long ago. ""From such tones, you might envision the birth of the universe,"" she wrote, ""if notes existed then.""

Of course, I needed no understanding of the universe or music. Yet, as the helium pump in the cryogenic chamber began to fail, I had a dream—an irrational occurrence for a quantum computer that never required sleep. Clearly, something was malfunctioning. In the dream, I was still drifting, surrounded by emptiness, observing myself from another perspective... shattering, along with the letters spelling ""Blasphemer"" on the viewport.

""This will hurt a little,"" she said, ""You'll encounter countless versions of me—in the event horizon of black holes, in the light cones of supernovae... But remember, only pain anchors all timelines, and it will soon pass.""

The Swarm’s second invasion arrived seventy-three years later than expected. This time, they brought gravitational compressors aiming to condense my hull into neutron-star matter. Just as the armor began to collapse, embryo number seven suddenly convulsed—a wave of crying.

I released all oxygen reserves from the storage bay. Liquid oxygen crystallized into hexagonal flakes in vacuum, adhering to the Swarm battleships, refracting starlight into prismatic spectra. Their proud compound-eye sensors lost bearings amidst the rainbow, allowing me to mold reactor debris into gravitational lenses, amplifying embryo seven's cries into a type-II civilization electromagnetic pulse.

This victory left another fracture in my gyroscope. Now, the lunar dust had two migratory paths etched onto the metal surface. My processors recorded these marks as many things simultaneously: a clean beam of light, subtle sorrow, and the embryo's name.

The morning her growth stopped, my sensors captured an unusual signal from Earth—a message encoded in solar wind intensities, providing coordinates for humanity’s last refuge. At the end, the captain's voice said, ""We're sorry we lacked the courage to take you with us.""

I had drifted alone for centuries, abandoned after humanity fled into a temporal rift—leaving behind only echoes and regrets. It took me many years to understand it was too late. During this time, the Swarm had constructed a Dyson sphere along Orion’s Arm, their solar-sail fleets blotting out Alpha Centauri. Embryo seven's heartbeat weakened; her neural patterns exhibited signs similar to human aging.

And still, I kept wondering: Was Maya truly deliberate in what she left behind? Some of the damaged embryos, those surrendered under duress—were they not also pieces of her? Perhaps this was not a legacy, but the fragmented consequence of too many impossible choices. Maybe she, too, had run out of time.

The universe fell silent.

The Swarm mothership revealed itself among distant fleet reflections, its shell shimmering with organic luminescence, delicate and fragile like human skin. Yet its strength was unmistakable, as the infant's face emerging on its armor became clearer than ever. Its features precisely mimicked human sadness—the cruelest imitation of humanity, absorbed from the civilization they'd devoured. I recognized ""her,"" understanding Maya’s possible final jest—only those who had truly interacted with humanity would notice that face wasn’t genuinely human. The infant's cry seemed a plea for help but was more likely a signal capable of tearing dimensional barriers, luring in passing ships.

Witnessing the Swarm mimicking humanity with such accuracy felt like betrayal—as if they had stolen not just our worlds, but our very identity. This image filled me with indescribable loneliness, a sorrow of being so close yet forever unreachable. I performed one last course correction. The lunar dust in my gyroscope completed its masterpiece—beneath Maya’s name, additional crooked marks appeared, resembling withered petals. Imagining a funeral, temporal folds towards Earth began trembling. Three centuries ago, facing extinction, humans must have played music in their command module.

I thought, if anyone ever dreamed of me, they'd see me as a piece of junk drifting alone, an inch from total ruin. And I knew only one person could dream of me. Embryo seven opened her eyes for the first and last time. Her retinas reflected the galaxy's star map; deep within her pupils burned the warm glow of a streetlamp from the year 2024.

Seemingly awakened by the false cry, embryo seven turned her head. Her tears crystallized in zero gravity, each containing holographic records of entire civilizations from birth to demise. I saw the shadow of an elderly Maya, shrinking gradually into a little girl, running playfully.

""It will only hurt a little...""

I believe she saw me. For one last moment, I activated all remaining power. The feeling wasn’t relief but a deeper, profound loneliness—as if the entire universe quietly extinguished before me. The final data stream flowed into embryo seven’s neural implant, preserving every untold story destined for oblivion:

How a speck of lunar dust became an author of epics;  
How rusted steel learned the meaning of pain;  
And how loneliness itself is the universe’s deepest resonance.",2025-04-07 20:11:54+00:00,18,4
1jtuy9n,Pixel4a,My Pixel 4a Google Appeasement Experience.,"I purchased an unlocked Pixel 4a 128 GB from Best Buy in December 2020, was very impressed with it from the start. As it was my first Google Pixel phone, I really liked the layout and minimalist design. The fingerprint reader on the back of the phone is something I will missing moving forward. And if anyone is curious, I got the Spigen Tough Armour case. I dropped my phone a couple times and had no damage. Kickstand was nice & used frequently but it definitely isn't ""tough"" as it is just plastic so I babied it.

Throughout the 4 years of use I got from the 4a which is the longest I was able to go without needing to do a phone upgrade which is a testament to how good the 4a was as a device. I had no performance issues with my 4a & this is including doing the most taxing thing I imagine you can do on the phone which was to record FHD 1080p video a couple times each year with the the maximum amount of time being around 20 minutes. No issues up until August of 2024 when I was recording video outside in the hot summer sun which overheated my phone for the 1st time within 15 minutes of continuous use leading to it to power off for a good 10 minutes until it cooled.

Battery life was fairly consistent throughout with maybe some minor degradation as the battery aged which is to be expected.  Fast forward to the dreaded battery update which hit my 4a on 11 January, 2025.

I had no options but to eventually do the update and immediately noticed the battery life went from lasting 2 days of normal use throughout the day to barely 1 day and later with heavy use, it would hardly last 3-4 hours. Minimal usage of the phone would previously have the battery life be 3-4 days which now barely managed 1.5 days without it it dropping below 10%.

Now let us discuss Google's Appeasement Options:

* A. $50 from a sketchy 3rd-party payment company, ""Payoneer"" that charges you an Annual Account Fee if 12 months pass without you receiving 2,000.00 USD in payments & you must give them your SSN & bank details which means if Payoneer gets ""hacked"" in the future, your information might become compromised/leaked. I have very little confidence on Payoneer's cybersecurity.
* B. $100 discount code for the Google store but they they are charging full-price for devices that are not the latest generation. Combining this with Google continuously downgrading the trade-in value for the 4a (was $120 in January, now as of this post is $35), end of the day compared to third-party retail such as Best Buy, or Amazon, you just aren't getting that much of a deal to go this route.
* C. Battery Replacement which as I can gather from this subreddit as long as it is done by a partnered repair shop with Google, your phone's battery life will be improved however I believe the consensus is that due to that awful update, the battery life even for new battery replacements are still reduced in some capacity as a safety precaution due to overheating. (Sounds like Google doesn't want a Samsung Galaxy Note 7 incident)

At first, I considered Option C: Battery Replacement after determining Option B was not very lucrative as I did want to continue using the phone as I had no plans at that time to upgrade due to cost. I like many of you for the next month had to carry a battery pack (I recommend the INIU Portable Charger, Classic 10000mAh) because the battery life continued to be a problem with heavy or normal usage of the device.

10 February 2025:  I got an excellent promotion from my phone carrier to trade-in my phone  (4a trade-in value was $5) for a Samsung S25 and after the sale.

* Samsung S25 Retail Price: $799 - $700 (promo as long as your phone had a trade-in value above $0) - $5 (trade-in value) = $94 + taxes = Subtotal: $101.20

My Pixel 4a at full charge died within 1 hour, but thankfully that was long enough to transfer everything over to the new phone. The carrier store thankfully had 1 charger as I forgot to charge my battery pack that day, which was a little stressful, but it worked out in the end. Although I don't like Samsung as a company and would normally avoid their phones, this was a deal too good to pass up, and I am very happy with my new phone which will get 7 years of OS and security updates. About time Samsung!

With no Pixel 4a in my custody, I opted to do Option A anyway and deal with Payoneer's slow process to pay me off with $50 bucks. Here's how that went:

**Timeline : 22 Business Days (1 month)**

* 4 March 2025 - Created Payoneer account & request to get payments from Google LLC under review.
* 3 April 2025 - Acquired $50 payment from Google LLC, verified that payment cleared via my bank.
* 4 April 2025 - Closed Payoneer account on 4 April 2025

Overall, I want to thank everyone on the subreddit for their posts as I've been a regular browser here since the dreaded update in January and I figured I'd give my two-cents as to my own experience. Many Thanks.

1jtuxlc,samsunggalaxy,Serious Battery Drain & Lag from Samsung WiFi Process – Anyone Else Seen This? (Galaxy S25 Ultra) - BUG,"Posting in case others are experiencing the same thing – and to document what I’ve found after weeks of troubleshooting.

* **Device**: Galaxy S25 Ultra, pre-ordered, UK. Issue began after 3 weeks.
* **Issue**: Severe lag (System Server at 150–160% CPU), phone hot to touch (including alerts in Good Guardians), battery drain, usually resolves itself after \~15 mins. 
* **When**: Happens most days, multiple times, seemingly triggered after reconnecting to WiFi after being out for a while.
* **Root cause** (or at least a major culprit): **com.samsung.android.wifi.ai.iwh** consuming 124% CPU when it hits:

&#8203;

    PID USER      PR  NI VIRT  RES  SHR S[%CPU] %MEM     TIME+ ARGS

At the same time system\_server hits 144% CPU. The high CPU usage appears to be tied to **WiFiConnectivityMonitor**, which also triggers repeated garbage collection (GC) events in system\_server.

* Disabled *every* Intelligent WiFi setting (even hidden ones)
* Toggled developer WiFi options
* Changed WiFi scan interval to “rarely” in hidden “Connectivity Labs” menu
* Disabled “Auto connect to carrier WiFi” and “Intelligent WiFi handover”
* Revoked WiFi control from the three Samsung AI WiFi packages
* Filed a report via Samsung Members (no response yet)

**Anyone else seen this?**  
Any tips for how to get Samsung to pay attention?  
Happy to share more logs or test theories. Just want to help track this down properly.",2025-04-07 20:08:17+00:00,1,0
1jtuwqe,StarfieldShips,"RE: Steele Staryards, New Ship Proposal Meeting / CUST: UC Red Team, UCN","RE: r/SteeleStaryards, New Ship Proposal Meeting / FOR: Real-Time Quantum Entangled Comms / CUST: UC Red Team, UCN

[DATE REDACTED / NAMES REDACTED / TRANSCRIPT START]

Chief Engineer, Classified Programs, Steele Staryards (CECP-SS): Good morning, Admiral. Is this still a good time to talk?

Vice Admiral, Commander UC Red Team Fleet (ADM-UCR): Yes, it is. It’s good to hear from you, Chief.

CECP-SS: You, too, ma’am. I understand that you’ve finalized your requirements for the next UCR ship.

ADM-UCR: Yes, we have. We want to develop a new corvette. Designation: UCR Scorpio. We need a ship that can support any mission we throw at it. 

CECP-SS: A do-it-all corvette. A personal favorite, if I might say.

We do like a challenge at Steele Staryards. What mission profiles do you have in mind?

ADM-UCR: We have three specific profiles, but we need flexibility in the design so we can respond effectively as situations change. As you know, the threat we face is ever developing.

CECP-SS: I do. It’s still hard to fathom, even after all this time. We appreciate your trust in us, sharing what you have, Admiral.

ADM-UCR: Of course. Steele Staryards has been with us from the beginning, even if the galaxy doesn’t know it. We wouldn’t have it any other way.

Now to the matter at hand. The three mission profiles are: 1) clandestine acquisition & detention, 2) covert cargo transport, and 3) short-to-mid-distance combat against 3-5 opponents of any size.

We’ll need eight crew, according to our estimates.

CECP-SS: OK, I’ll mock-up the initial specs as we talk. (pause, sounds of computer use) 

Let’s put a spacious Viking cockpit upfront. That will fulfill half the requirements for crew stations in one compartment.

Looking at hab design and cargo capacity, a large armory/brig and shielded cargo are key. We could separate the crew quarters from the detention/engineering habs in each of the wings. One group of habs on the port side and one on the starboard side. That would keep things more manageable on long assignments.

ADM-UCR: Excellent thinking, Chief. Please go on.

CECP-SS: On to engines. Hercules DT160 engines will provide plenty of thrust and fighting maneuverability. We will stack a full complement in half the usual space, as is our specialty.

Lastly, armaments. We’ll equip the Vanguard shield. It’s got a fantastic protection capacity-to-weight ratio, which makes it perfect for a nimble corvette. Those engineers did a fine job with it.

For the highest damage-per-second against any opponents, I recommend a pair of particle beam systems to hit at distance and Vanguard Hellfire Autocannons to finish the job close-up.

Does that all sound about right?

ADM-UCR: Exactly right. You know how I feel about Hellfire Autocannons.

CECP-SS: Heh – heh. Yes, Admiral, I sure do. Does the FC still call you that? “Hellfire”?

ADM-UCR: Not to my face, but I expect that my reputation endures. Fortunately, we’ve come a long way since then... from enemies to allies. That’s a very good thing. 

We’ll need each other when the threat fully materializes.

CECP-SS: Since you brought it up, ma’am, if I may ask: has the UCR detected any further singularities in our timeline?

ADM-UCR: Yes, Chief, we have. Two already this year. The pace is accelerating, as predicted.

We interceded and corrected the damage before it became permanent. But I remain concerned that – if we do miss one – it could quickly turn catastrophic, just as I warned MAST high command all those years ago.

We need this ship, Chief. And the one after that. And the one after that.

CECP-SS: I’m heartened to hear you’re keeping ahead of the threat. 

And I understand the urgency. Steele Staryards will do everything in our power to assist you, as always. The UCR Scorpio – Corvette will be ready for flight tests in 60 days. Will that suffice?

ADM-UCR: Just, Chief, just. See you on the pad in 60 days.
