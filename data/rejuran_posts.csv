1jye0lb,SeoulPlasticSurgery,Skin treatments pre/post surgery,"I am getting DES, rhinoplasty, fat grafting and facelift. I have 2 weeks in Seoul - does anyone know if it’s ok to do a one day package of skin treatments pre or post surgery, eg: Rejuran, IPL, Ultherapy, Microneeding, Thermage, PRP, etc? I’ve inquired with a few clinics but none have really given me a concrete answer.

1jy1xr4,koreatravel,Dining out after skin treatment,"I scheduled a skin clinic appointment on my full last day in Korea. I’ll likely get a Rejuran treatment resulting in bumps on my face. I initially planned to dine out at a nice place in Gangnam but now wonder if takeaway is a less embarrassing idea. 

Have you gotten skin treatments/plastic surgery and then immediately dined out? Do service people and other customers not care given the norm of treatments? Or do they stare at you and give worse service? I feel silly for possibly feeling self-conscious but want to enjoy my last night.",2025-04-13 07:08:54+00:00,0,13
1jxzf3h,AcneScars,Feeling so defeated. What works!? Does anything make a difference?,"I have one atrophic scar centre of my nose. It is the worst place to have a scar as it is totally centre point of my face.

I have had:

Microneedling
Microneedling with prp
Pico laser with rejuran injection
Rejuran injection on own
Filler 
3 x erbium yag
Subcision
Filler
Filler removed because of lumps and granules
Kenalog for filler 

I can say that it looks worst today than when I set out on this journey. My scar is just as deep, but now my nose is chronically red and the are treated is severely hypopigmented. 

The Kenalog also caused atrophy. So now I have to wait and see if that will recover. Everything has done has made it worse. 

What can I do? Is there any option left?
Filler is now a no go- it always made it look worse.

Is prf worth it? Or continued rejuran s?
Nanofat?
Am I at the end of the line?

What has worked for you?",2025-04-13 04:18:20+00:00,3,1
1jxp4l4,30PlusSkinCare,30 F Sculptra or Rejuran for Acne Scars?,"Hello everyone! Hoping to get some feedback as to what might be the better option for my skin concerns which are just acne scarring.

I got a package of 3 sessions of RF Microneedling for a discounted rate of $ 2,100 or so (HCOL area) and it comes with some Alastin aftercare serum and either: 

PRP injection
Rejuran 2 syringe injection
Sculptra 1 vial

The women at the med spa all seem to be leaning toward sculptra (they've done it themselves) but they had differing concerns from my own and, of course, I have not been reading great things about it online. Rejuran seems ""safer"" in that regard, but I'm hearing it's more subtle/ will take additional applications to see results (something I'm not against). The PRP seems more effective for undereye circles, which I'm not too concerned with at the moment. 

I'm hoping to collect some more information before making a decision, would you lovely ladies have any feedback on which option you'd recommend I take given I'm mostly concerned with my scarring? I'll take other benefits of course!

The photos are from before the RF needling and right after to give a good idea of my general texture and face fullness.

1jxl37c,DIYaesthetics,Urgent! Help me make a order before tariffs hit!,"Hey everyone! I'm looking for product recommendations to stock up on before the new tariffs potentially affect prices. I recently started getting into microneedling and just tried mesotherapy for the first time. I’ve been getting educated and my MO has been to try one thing at a time, but feel like I wanna do one big order soon and even though I’ve been consuming a lot of content and reading about meso and micro needling I haven’t had the opportunity to try everything for myself. 

My current inventory is pretty minimal - I only have Rona's stem cell ampules and Curinex. I'm interested in expanding my collection, particularly for meso and microneedling.

What are everyone's favorite products in these categories? I'm planning to make a larger purchase before the tariffs hit. I've been eyeing Hanheal PDRN or Syniro, and Rejuran. 

I'm also interested in GHK copper peptide but don't know which brand to get or where to find a good one.

Plus some skin treatments like rejuran, skin botox and nasolabial fold fillers.

My recovery has been totally horrendous, the first night I got to my accommodation I vomitted the entire night. Then the past 2 days my swelling is incredibly bad. My whole head is blown up into a balloon and feels a bit hard. I'm on Day 5 today, and swelling only started to lessen a bit, but my head is still huge and I'm still puffed up, though my face feels less hard. 
My hairline is still so high up and head feels so numb. 

I visited the clinic everyday, and they dont seem to be worried, or I feel like they're just trying not to make me panic. I feel like they downplayed a lot how the recovery will be :( As from my research, this kind of swelling usually happen more from more intense surgeries like bone shaving or a facelift? 

I'm so worried :(  Has anyone else have this experience during recovery before? Especially with a forehead lift? 

For a long time I wanted to get my deviated septum and my very low eyelids fixed.. And thought I needed a forehead lift, which the clinic convinced me I needed as well. Now I'm really losing my mind about it and thinking what have I done..

Aku belakangan ini lagi pengen rajin treatment karena katanya lebih works daripada skincare. Problem ku saat ini acne scars, dehydrated lines di jidat (satu tapi annoying huhu) dan PIH. 

What treatments you usually do to be low maintenance? Aku udah pernah interdermal salmon dna, laser CO2, dan prp microneedling. So far microneedling paling works.

Ada yang pernah coba rejuran? Does it really works? Karena katanya harus 3x berturut-turut dulu baru bisa 1-2 kali aja setahun. Considering this tapi masih ragu.

1jp7jt2,SeoulPlasticSurgery,Ocean Clinic or Egg Clinic for Ulthera Prime & Rejuran HB,"Hi All!

I've been going crazy on this and would greatly appreciate everyone's help! I'm going to Seoul for 36 hours in late April, specially April 23rd to 25th. Since things are getting super booked up, I grabbed a booking for both Egg Clinic and Ocean Clinic.

The time I was able to get at Ocean Clinic is WAY more convenient for my schedule. However, I'm interested in getting Ulthera Prime and Rejuran HB, two procedures where the practitioner is pretty important. Obviously the price is right at Ocean as well, but Egg Clinic is well respected by Koreans and known as a more detailed, slower clinic.

The other thing to consider is that Egg Clinic will have just gotten their Ulthera Prime device when i arrive, whereas Ocean Clinic already has their Ulthera Prime device - so it's possible Ocean Clinic will be more familiar with the device by the time I get there!

**NOTE** \- I don't care if i feel rushed or it doesn't feel luxe, I just want to job to be well executed and for the treatment to be effective.

Am i putting myself at risk for a less effective treatment if I go to Ocean Clinic over Egg Clinic? Thanks so much!!",2025-04-01 21:33:59+00:00,2,1
1jojqob,AcneScars,"looking for recs to remove my scarring! thinking of tretinoin, microneedling, fraxel, rejuran, etc.","hihi i’m 23 and i’ve had a lot of acne from the ages of 15-20 yrs old and i would love to get some help on how to rid of my acne scars 🥺 the first 3 pics are right after my skin is freshly washed after a full day of makeup, the last 2 are with makeup! tbh i’m quite happy with where i’m at now as my acne used to be a nightmare for me but would love to rid of my scarring mainly in the areas underneath my eyes.

to give some of my general thoughts and context, I have prescription tretinoin and i’ve been on and off of it for a few years but i’m really bad at being consistent. so it has helped. but I’m not sure how much at the moment with my pretty inconsistent routine..

and for the most part now I don’t get so many big active pimples these days maybe once every two months max? based on my stress levels 😭

some other things i’d like to note is that I live in a country where beauty treatments including skin treatments like laser, microneedling, fillers, etc. are insanelyyy expensive and I don’t trust many clinics here so I would like to avoid going to clinics rn cuz the quality really isn’t there for the price they’ll charge me. but maybe i’m just prejudiced and there will be good clinics here but regardless it’s srsly more expensive than normal here 😭 also for laser/fraxel I heard that sometimes you can end up losing face fat/elasticity and that kinda scared me. (I do have a dermatologist from a hospital I frequent but it’s mainly for medical purposes, they don’t offer many other procedures)

so as I was exploring options, I thought maybe I could start microneedling myself? Unless it’s just super risky and likely I could fuck up? Anyone have any thoughts on that?

I also go to Korea around once or twice a year so I wonder if any treatments there could be worth it like Rejuran (altho I don’t think it’s necessarily for scarring in particular) but I know that most of these treatments require several sessions over time so I’m not sure that would work if I would only be going once a year

tldr; to rid of my acne scars within maybe a span of 2-5 years should i just keep being consistent with my tretinoin, should i start microneedling myself, should i try rejuran, or should i just find a rlly good clinic, pay the money and get like. fraxel or several sessions of microneedling at a clinic

i’ll be sincerely grateful for any help or support! thank u thank u",2025-04-01 01:20:38+00:00,0,6

1jnv0n4,KoreanBeauty,My experience with Rejuran,"I have read a lot of stories about how rejuran was the most painful thing a lot of people have experienced, even people saying it is more painful than getting a tattoo or nipple piercings. 

I did a miscalculation on time and had to hurry for my flight, so I decided to not get any numbing done as it would save a lot of time. I had filled in lips, cheeks and also rejuran full face including under the eyes, and I wanted to reassure people that it doesn’t hurt as much as people say it does. To me it feels a little over  exaggerated. I would compare the pain to getting your eyebrows plucked, or waxing your upper lip. Completely manageable in my opinion. 

Now I do have a high skin tolerance, but I was a little freaked out after I read all those stories of people saying it was the worst pain they have experienced and was waiting for the worst. And I wanted to make this post to kind of reassure people that it’s not that bad, and to not let this aspect hold you back from trying rejuran for yourself!! ",2025-03-31 04:19:41+00:00,23,23

1jmmgo3,DIYCosmeticProcedures,DIY subcision for acne scarring,"Has anyone used a cannula to perform subcision for their acne scarring? I have some minor rolling scars on the side of my cheek that could benefit from subcision. So far I’ve used monothreads to create a scaffold/subcising a little and I’ve also DIYed a few Rejuran S treatments now.

1jm3354,DIYCosmeticProcedures,I finally used a cannula 🫣,"After much research and having analysis paralysis, I finally broke down and bought a few 23g 50mm cannulas. I wanted to use Rejuran I without the risk of hitting a vein and bruising.

I was SO FREAKED OUT while watching videos, so I was practically hyperventilating as I got started. I started with my dominant side, and it wasn't TOO bad getting the pilot hole and cannula to the right place. But then I was so nervous that I wasn't moving enough retrograde while dispensing the product, so there was an oval-shaped lump under my eye. 

I only managed to get 0.25 ml before I stopped on that side. I probably could've gone back and added more, but I was losing my mind at this point.

The left side was MUCH harder for me as my left hand was not as confident getting the cannula in. The cannula seemed to get stuck, I kept switching hands, and I couldn't get myself to just shove it in, so I had to use the pilot hole needle twice. The second time I put in the cannula, there was almost a little pop and it glided in smoothly.

This time, I did a better job spreading out the product, but I only used 0.25 ml so that both sides would be even. Per the instructions, I then massaged both sides to distribute the product. The lumps stayed for a few more hours, but then I went to bed and made sure to sleep flat on my back and let gravity do its job.

This morning, I could only feel a little bit of the lump, although it still looks puffier than normal. I'm hoping to do the rest of the syringe in a couple of weeks and then graduate to just using regular Rejuran in that area.

I appreciate the advice and support of this group. I wouldn't have had the courage to try, and now I feel like I can confidently do it moving forward.

1jlw9k7,koreatravel,Honest Review of Lienjang Myeongdong,"Hello, as I was highly appreciative of these types of posts before ai booked my appointment I thought now that I had it I would give an honest review of my visit to Lienjang (Myeongdong -branch).

I booked about 2 months ago, via WhatsApp, communication is flawless and they even asked me the day prior if I have arrived, doing good and can make it tomorrow - it‘s pretty much a very friendly reminder! 

Now before I go into it let me just point out that my understanding is: you get what you pay for - hence I think these clinics are compared factories. Many serve tourists who come for some simple treatments, these clinics don‘t need to build any relationship with their customers. You get exactly what you pay for and their instructions are very simple and clear: They tell you to wait - you wait, they tell you to follow - you follow, etc. It‘s really that simple and I think many negative reviews about these types of clinics (which scared me too) are from people who often just ask too much or their expectations are too high.
Of course respect is needed & understanding, but I wanted to lay out how my mindset was going in! 

I arrived half an hour before my appointment, the building is super easy to find and you just go up to the 5th floor with an elevator. Upon arrival I waited just a couple of minutes until my consultant picked me up in the waiting room and went over to a separate room to have a quick chat. I have never done anything like this in my life but upon own research I already told them what I would be interested in doing (Cleaning & Laser, maybe mole) - so she asked me what I want to achieve and we quickly agreed on Aqua Peel - she showed me the price and followed up with Laser to which I said Shurink sounds interesting, she then touched my face and chin to confirm it‘s good for me. She mentioned moles but also said they would need more visits so we let go of that & she mentioned Rejuran - I don‘t know if this was upselling but I just said no not needed and we moved on. Shurink was on promotion and she told me 600 shots are recommended, so we put both on the list and I asked about a third treatment afterwards to calm the skin, we added Cryo.
Total cost was about 300.000 Won.
During the consultation I asked about any brand, serum etc. she could recommend and also some very basic things like how to spot the nearest trash can (😂) - she answered even those and really wasn‘t rushing!

I was transferred over to the lockers and the sink where I could store away my stuff and wash my face. Then I had to wait 15mins in the waiting area until I was collected and transferred to another colleague who did the Aqua Peel.

Aqua Peel: Took about 20ish minutes, it felt absolutely amazing, she went over tougher spots several times. 
Afterwards she put on some numbing cream and I went back to the waiting area. 

This time I had to wait about 30mins and while I was waiting I was obviously watching everything else around me. Most employees don‘t speak English and there was one that had the most amazing glow on her skin, when she passed me and wasn‘t with another client I quickly stopped her and used translation to compliment her glow and ask her for any recommendations - She was surprised but really happy about it and wrote it down on my phone!

I was then once more collected and transferred over to the sink to wash away the numbing cream and then I got into a room with the laser. After a couple of minutes a female doctor came in, she was super open and talkative, she was realizing I am doing all of this for the first time, tried to get me relaxed and motivated me to talk to her - so we talked about my vacation, she gave me advice on my trip etc. She was actually more kind than most of my local doctors I‘ve been visiting for 10+ years!

Once again I sat down in the waiting area for about 10mins - after I went to the same room I has Aqua Peel in before.
Cryo: It took about 20-25mins and it felt once again so cooling and relaxing!

Afterwards I was let loose to the lockers where I just got ready again when my consultant came to me, thanked my patience & handed me some final instructions and a box of high quality face masks.

I left the clinic after about 2.5h (obviously I arrived early, but still was taken prior to my appointment).

Results seem good after 10h, skin is smooth, sebums are very small & there‘s a difference in visibility of my jawline (the doctor even showed me a side by side comparison during the laser). My cheeks are still a bit warm & probably an hour or two after my appointment the toner or whatever they put on me in the end was really glossy so I wore a mask which they handed me when I left.

Overall they did a good job, exactly what I paid for + valuable recommendations. 

Feel free to ask about anything, it might take me a moment to reply tho!

Sorry if I have forgotten something! :)",2025-03-28 14:24:01+00:00,47,10

1jl9bw0,DIYaesthetics,More Juvelook or Try Rejuran HB instead?,"Hi, I just found this community while searching more about korean skinboosters.

So last week I went to my go to aesthetic clinic to do masseter botox (it was 2022 the last time I done it). While talking with their administrator, I got a free treatment of 1cc of Juvelook because my bill hit a minimum requirements for the promotion. Then I consulted with the doctor, she suggested me to add 2cc of Juvelook for the rest of my face because 1cc could only do for under eye and I did go with it.

I was quite impressed by how significant one of my under eyes look after Juvelook, it surely gave more fresh & plump comparing to the other under eye without the treatment. After the treatment, the doctor suggested me to have twice more of Juvelook session for the next 2 months with 1 month apart for the maximum result. 

Please note that I never have any skinbooster or collagen stimulator before, so this is my first experience. But seeing the progress of Juvelook (today is one week post Juvelook), I’m feeling curiousty takes my decision to take another reservation for Juvelook. I remember about the hype of Rejuran and intrigued to try it, especially the Rejuran HB+ but the price in my local clinics is pricier compare with Juvelook treatment. So I’m thinking to buy Rejuran HB+ and ask a home-service licensed aesthetician to done it rather than do it in clinics.

Honestly I don’t really have any major issues with my skin since I’ll be 30 this mid year, I have some but small acne scars around cheeks. My goal are to tighten my pores and freshen up my face. I also drink marine collagen powder every day for 3 years now.

Do you think I should go with another Juvelook sessions or maybe try Rejuran?

1jjf7ds,koreatravel,Recent experience at LV Plastic Surgery Gangnam,"I was going to wait a few days until there's some sort of resolution before writing this but it's been bugging me so I thought I'd share for those who are first timers like me looking to get procedures done at Korean clinics. I could also use some advice in terms of how to approach this situation and what I should do next.  
  
I got Rejuran, Juvelook and Potenza done at LV, and I opted for sedation. I woke up in the facials room (for post-treatment facials) with a sore head and neck and i couldn't turn my head left. I get stiff neck from time to time from sleeping wrong so I'm familiar with the feeling, but this was 10x worse. I asked what happened and was then told that they had positioned my head facing left during the procedure because I wasn't breathing properly when I was under. I thought, fair enough, and went about my day thinking the pain should subside tomorrow.

It wasn't until late that night i realised **the entire right side of my scalp was numb**, followed by a staticky feeling that radiates along the numb area when I turn my head. I immediately knew this was a nerve compression. For context, I have bulging discs in my lower back which causes numbness in my leg- and I know full well that this is the same exact problem - only in my neck/head.

This has nothing to do with the procedure itself, I can be sure of that. My face is fine, it's not numb, it's healing quite nicely from the treatments.

I've since reached out to them via the same Whatsapp chat where I initially reached out to them on and booked the appointment. I explained that Dr. Seo had positioned my head a certain way which is causing this pain and this numbness. They responded with

>*""Potenza is a treatment that combines microneedling with radiofrequency (RF) energy to stimulate the deeper layers of the skin. The pumping tip, in particular, provides a stronger stimulation compared to the standard tip, which may cause temporary numbness. Please don’t worry, as this is a temporary condition, and it should improve within a few days. If you have any concerns, feel free to reach out!""*

I'm not hopeful for a ""resolution"" but I definitely won't have them using the treatment as an excuse to bury the issue – when the root cause of this pain is from the position my head was put in by Dr. Seo – which is what I was told. I reiterated that and asked them to fill me in on what happened, but I was redirected to a ""LV Customer Inquiry"" chat via Telegram so they could *assist (me) more quickly* verbatim.

So I did, but my message remains unseen and it has been 24 hours. And mind you all this little exchanging of messages have been slow as, compared to when I booked in for the procedure but I guess that's expected.  
  
Other than that, the experience was quite underwhelming. I chose LV to avoid that factory, in & out type of clinic and a more personalised and warm approach but that was exactly what I got anyway.   
  
I wanted to have my skin assessed and have treatments tailored to my needs but my consultation was with a consultant. I did my research and knew what I wanted so all she did was tell me what each treatment does and its price. She wasn't more helpful than a google search.

I woke up from my treatment still feeling woozy and I was handed a piece of paper with different products and the aesthetician upselling products left right and centre. Unfortunately I did end up buying one of the products I could have done without.",2025-03-25 09:14:12+00:00,10,1

1jiyazy,DIYCosmeticProcedures,Beginner’s Guide to Skin Boosters,"Hi everyone! I thought it would be helpful to post a general guide for **skin boosters for beginners**. I’ll be sharing a separate guide for advanced users soon, but this one is for those who are just starting to explore and want to learn more.

**A little about me:** I’m a PhD scientist and one of your mods here, with a deep passion for applying science to skin rejuvenation. I do a lot of self-experimentation, but everything I share is grounded in literature and clinical studies.

# 💧 What Are Skin Boosters?

Skin boosters are powerful tools to slow and improve the skin aging process. As we age, we see:

* Decreased collagen, elastin, and glycosaminoglycans
* Reduction in epidermal/dermal cell count and rete ridges
* Increased oxidative stress
* Irregular pigmentation due to melanocyte activation

**Skin boosters help** by enhancing the extracellular environment, improving pigmentation, inflammation, and vasodilation. A great paper I recommend dives deep into **six different classes of skin boosters**.

# ✳️ Skin Boosters with Microneedling (MN)

If you're new, check out my previous post on **Microneedling**—it covers best practices, sanitation, and more.

**Microneedles** enhance the effect of topical treatments by delivering actives directly into the skin while minimizing side effects. When paired with skin boosters, results can be dramatically improved.

# 🧪 My Personal Skin Booster Recommendations for MN (Based on Experiments)

**For Wrinkles & General Aging**  
Start with:

* PN / PDRN
* Exosomes
* HA (mostly for glide)

**My tip:** Look for products that combine HA + PN for ease of use. But when I use HA and PN separately, I get better results—only because I can increase PN concentration.

**Product recommendations:**

* **PN/PDRN + HA:** Syniro, Elaxen PN, Illuma PN
* **Exosomes:** Filcore
* **Budget-friendly:** *White Silk* from Amazon – \[SCM85 stem cell + 10% PDRN, HA, Growth Factors\] – I was genuinely impressed with this one! It has both HA, PDRN, and growth factors. If money is an issue, you do not need exosomes.

✅ **MN Protocol:**

1. Sanitize skin
2. Apply exosomes, let absorb
3. Apply glide (e.g., Syniro)
4. MN pass (3x)
5. Re-apply exosomes

🔁 **Recovery is key:**  
Use growth factors and exosomes morning and night for a week post-treatment. I like **Plated Intense** or **White Silk** for recovery.  
Also, nourish from within—I’ll post my supplement routine soon.

# 🌈 Skin Boosters for Hyperpigmentation

* BCN Tranexamic Acid
* Dermaheal SB

# 💉 Skin Boosters via Mesotherapy (Meso)

I want to take a pause here and mention that you absolutely do not need to move to meso if you are fearful or find the notion of injecting yourself crazy. But if you do want to consider it, I want to emphasize that you need to read books, papers, and watch many hours of tutorials from Rumble and other platforms to fully educate yourself. My recommendation is just a direction—you should not take it if it goes against your current knowledge.

# 🧬 Why MN Is More Powerful Than Meso

Just wanted to emphasize that MN is way more powerful than meso, if you ask me—and here is the scientific explanation for that:

The dermis consists of two layers:

* **Papillary layer** (about 1/3 of the dermis, directly under the epidermis)
* **Reticular layer** (makes up the bulk of the dermis)

A study by Philippeos et al. (2018) confirmed the presence of two different fibroblast subpopulations in the dermis, specific to each layer. They found decreased fibroblast numbers and diversity with age—especially in the **papillary dermis** (Mine et al., 2008).

This is why we want to **target papillary fibroblasts** for skin bioremodeling. **Medical microneedling (0.5–1 mm)** can reach the papillary dermis, while meso injections often don’t—because it’s hard to inject that shallow and be precise.

For this reason, **MN is far superior to meso**, and I hope I’ve convinced you to stay with MN and be happy about that 😉

# 🔬 Mesotherapy Recommendations

Now moving to meso (if you are adamant to move to this world and have done your months and months of research). I believe there is an absolute synergistic response when you combine meso and microneedling on the same day with the right skin boosters.

**Start with:**

* PN / PDRN
* Exosomes

**PN/PDRN Products I Trust:**

* Rejuran Healer (face & eye)
* Nucleofill (Age / Strong – for face only)
* Vitaran (face & eye)

**Exosomes:**

* ASCE+
* Filcore

# 📅 Protocol I Follow (And Recommend)

**Every 2 weeks for 3–4 months only** (then shift to monthly):

**Day 0:**

* MN with exosomes (Filcore)
* Meso with PN (e.g., Rejuran)

**Day 14:**

* Meso with exosomes

**Repeat the cycle**

Just wanted to emphasize that any **biweekly skin treatments are very aggressive** and should only be done **short-term (3–4 months)**. After that, transition to **monthly treatments**.

# 🌟 Pro Tip

If your budget allows, **kickstart your protocol with a Halo laser or strong peel** to boost skin remodeling. Your results will be even more noticeable.

Let me know what questions you have or what you'd like me to cover next! I’ll be posting the **advanced guide soon** 💛",2025-03-24 18:43:15+00:00,171,98
1jitec6,koreatravel,Upselling in skin clinics,"Thought I’d share my experience of a skin clinic. I had a rough idea of what I wanted before going in, but I’d heard that a lot of skin clinics have AI skin analysis so I was open to hear the consultants opinion of what could help me. I didn’t have time to visit one in Seoul but upon arriving in Busan I found one aimed towards tourists that had availability on the day. I did a bit of research and the reviews suggested it’s reasonably priced and it’s not fancy but does the job. I didn’t understand what a lot of the treatments consisted of online, the websites were poorly translated or designed, so I mainly looked at what treatments people on social media were getting. 

Anyway, this branch of the clinic didn’t have the AI analysing machine so I have a consultation with a girl and a translator. I explain my concerns as I’m very self-conscious of my problematic skin, hence the decision to visit the clinic. I ask for her opinion of what may help and she suggests 6cc rejuran, saying it would help with the redness and my other concerns. I wasn’t sure what rejuran was, so i asked if it was a hydration injection and she said yes and pointed to the page in front of me, which didn’t have much more information on it. She also suggested a titanium lift which is 4 services in one. I was asking questions through the translator about these services trying to get more information. I also googled rejuran to try and find out more information. From both the consultants opinion and a quick google search it appeared like a miracle worker for my skin. She had added these services to the basket when I told her actually what I was interested in was LDM, a non-invasive laser treatment for boosting collagen. The translator then went on to say that the consultant really wanted for me to get Botox in my forehead and around my eyes to smooth out my fine lines. 

As the computer screen was in Korean I hadn’t been following along with what she was doing. By the end she’d added all the options and the total was a hefty 1.4 million won. It’s a lot of money but in the moment I was almost for go hard or go home, thinking this might be the answer to all of skin concerns, knowing the services were cheaper here. I caught myself on and told her I just wanted to take the LDM and basic facial, I needed to think about and research the rest before I commit to anything too hastily. I did notice a difference after the LDM, but I could probably have skipped the facial although it did clean out my pores. I was in and out of the treatment room in 30mins, it was very quick, but I left happy with the improvement, and knowing I didn’t have my face botched.

I began looking on tiktok at rejuran afterwards only to find out it’s salmon sperm they inject into your face. Apparently it can also be extremely painful which when I asked the translator if it was sore, they’d told me only a bit. Both rejuran and the titanium lift require several sessions, or the titanium is good for six months then requires repetition, meaning the $800 or so they were trying to get me to spend would of been obsolete in 6 months time. With a good skin care routine I’m sure the results would be extended but overall I think these services are a quick-fix and won’t sort out problematic skin indefinitely. 

I wanted to post this as I think these skin clinics can pray on self-conscious girls or guys, sending them down a  cosmetic rabbit hole, as I’m sure has happened time and time again. With Botox becoming cheap and easily accessible, and social media giving girls unrealistic beauty standards, I think these clinics are making a lot of money from self-conscious or naive individuals.

1jih1qx,DIYaesthetics,"PIE on face + huge pores, whats the best approach?","So I've been struggling in the past to maintain a smoother skin, I used to have acne and very dull skin on my face. Now that I've cleared my skin and brightened it, I'm not sure where to start to fix the PIE left on my face? For starters I've tried carbon laser, I've had PRP microneedling 2 weeks ago and I feel like it helped clear any acne and brighten it overall, but my PIE is still visible. I've been to 3 different med spas. Already consulted with a dermatologist and I've been on tret for a year, and azaleic acid for a couple of months and I feel like the PIE is still there and nothings happening. Also have Niacinamide, AHA, tranexamic acid, and ALA in combination with my skin care routine (I would cycle them alternatively) but I feel like the issue lies deeper and not sure what to start with. 

Do I meso? MN? whats the best product you could recommend for me to try? rejuran, skinbooster, exosomes?

1jig5az,koreanskincare,How Koreans Actually Achieve Glass Skin – recommended products and basic tips,"
Step 1: Understanding Your Skin Type
First, it's important to know your skin type, 
as there is no perfect skincare routine that suits everyone. 
Determine whether you have dry, oily, combination skin, 
or specific concerns like acne or wrinkles. 
This understanding allows you to choose products and methods that are right for you.

Now, let's move on to the basic steps of skincare.

The first step is cleansing. 
Removing accumulated oils and impurities from the skin prevents 
clogged pores and helps prevent breakouts.

First Cleansing: 
It's important to gently remove makeup and surface impurities from the skin. Using oil-based cleansers is recommended for this purpose. 
For example, I recommend the Pure Cleansing Oil from Manyo Factory or the Heartleaf Pore Control Cleansing Oil from Anua. 
These products effectively remove makeup and impurities 
while being gentle on the skin.

Second Cleansing: 
Use a foam cleanser to thoroughly remove any remaining residues and sebum. The Deep Pore Cleansing Soda Foam from Manyo Factory has excellent cleansing power and rinses well, making it effective for removing sunscreen as well.

Through these first and second cleansing steps, you can thoroughly cleanse your skin.

After cleansing, the moisturizing step is necessary to supply moisture to the skin. Lack of moisture can lead to dryness and inflammation. It's advisable to use lightweight, fragrance-free, non-comedogenic products. 
Products containing ceramides, glycerin, and hyaluronic acid are particularly effective.

For example, the White Truffle First Spray Serum from d'Alba contains white truffle extract, which helps with whitening and wrinkle improvement. The Healer Turnover Ampoule from Rejuran contains PDRN ingredients, making it effective for skin regeneration and moisturization. Additionally, Medicube's Red Moisture Cream is known as a low-irritation moisturizing cream suitable for sensitive skin.

Through these products, you can provide ample moisture and nutrients to your skin.

Lastly, sunscreen is a necessity, not an option. UV exposure can cause wrinkles, dark spots, and even lead to skin cancer. Therefore, it's important to use a sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher daily. Make it a habit to apply sunscreen even when indoors.

Recommended sunscreens include the Waterfull Essence Sun Cream from d'Alba, the Biome Healer Youth Formula Sun Cream from Rejuran, the Red Moisture Real Sun Cream from Medicube, and the Green Tangerine Vita C Dark Spot Tone Up Sun Cream from Goodal. These products are loved for their high UV protection and gentle formulation.

1jh99gi,SeoulPlasticSurgery,Rejuran Treatment at Liting,"Hi guyssssss~~ I came to share my experience of getting rejuran in korea!! Since i came to korea i have been struggling with my skin So after doing a small research, i decided to go to a clinic to get the rejuran treatment done!
I visited Liting in Seoul. Why did i choose this clinic? Well, Liting is a specialized lifting hospital trusted by many korean patients since they have expert specialists who perform lifting procedures as well as skin boosters just as rejuran. They also offer their own patented lifting injections and threads for customized treatments. I was really curious about the lifting treatments because they have options such as mini lifting and thread liftings.
Buuuuut that day i just went to get rejuran.

Overall experience: Since the staff spoke english, the consultation went smoothly, and the doctor explained everything clearly. The procedure itself was quick and comfortable, just a few small injections. Also, compared to other clinics, the doctors here have experience with surgeries so every time the doctor injected the needle, i felt almost no pain. After the treatment, i got some redness and bruises (which is completely normal) and my face was all healed after a week and a half.
So if you guys are even wondering where to get a good thread lifting or skin boosters, this place is reeeeeeally good!! Literally 10/10 experience and service. 
To make a reservation i just contacted their instagram @liting_global !! they answered really fast and answered all my doubts 🤭

And if you guys wonder, this is the adress: 서울 강남구 도산대로 119 K타워 7th Floor Seoul

Sooo that’s all! If you have any doubts just ask! i will be happy to answer🥰🩷",2025-03-22 14:09:42+00:00,6,14

1jfl946,AsianBeauty,The Realistic Korean Girl’s Beauty Routine:What It’s Actually Like!!,"Growing up in Korea but also having strong connections to the States, I’ve noticed that Korean girls have a reputation for being more high maintenance compared to the average American. In reality, it’s not as intense as people might think. The key difference lies in efficiency, tech-savviness, and knowing what works without spending excessive time on routines.

It’s also important to note that K-beauty brands popular overseas aren’t necessarily the same ones used by people in Korea. Here’s a breakdown of what’s more realistic:

1. Skin Boosters Are a Thing

Skin boosters are incredibly common and affordable in Korea. Clinics frequently offer promotions, making it almost as accessible as buying skincare products. It’s normal for people to start getting treatments in their early 20s.

The three most popular procedures are:

Botox: A highly favored treatment for maintaining a smooth appearance.

Rejuran Healer (PDRN; Salmon DNA): Known for promoting skin elasticity and a glossy complexion, though it can cause temporary swelling.

Inmode (Slimming Jawline): Offers a noticeable jaw-slimming effect but can feel quite intense during the procedure.

For those who prefer a non-invasive approach, skincare products from the same brands (like Rejuran Healer Turnover Ampoule) are also widely available. Although less dramatic than injections, these products are still popular for promoting youthful and elastic skin.

2. The Unchanging Staples

There are some classic skincare and makeup products that have remained iconic in Korea for over a decade. These products have earned a loyal following and are still commonly used (based on top-rankings in Olive Young)

VDL Eye Primer

Skinfood Black Sugar Scrub

Banila Co Cleansing Balm

3. Collagen Masks? Not Really. But Sheet Masks? Definitely.

While collagen masks are nothing new, they’ve never really gained significant traction in Korea despite some recent global hype. In particular, some are criticized for being too dry, especially when used overnight.

In contrast, sheet masks remain a staple in everyday routines. They are affordable, effective, and designed to deliver an intense boost of ampoule to the skin. The goal is to see noticeable improvements the next day without breaking the bank.

Popular brands like Mediheal consistently dominate the rankings, especially among those in their 30s. Recently, brands like Centellian 24 have also gained attention, focusing on dark spot treatment with ingredients like centella asiatica.

4. 화잘먹 Moisturizers Are Essential

A good 화잘먹 moisturizer means it layers well under makeup without greasiness or caking. Korean consumers are particularly selective about moisturizers that not only hydrate but also enhance the skin’s glow and smoothness when paired with SPF or foundation.

It’s common to see this tag on skincare products in shops, signaling that the moisturizer works well under makeup and keeps skin looking good throughout the day.",2025-03-20 09:51:13+00:00,1150,49

1jdh3sx,SeoulPlasticSurgery,Comparing Clinic Costs,"Hey, just wanted to share the table I made to narrow down my clinic choice.

The first 3 clinics (Ruby, 345, and AB) were recommended by BeautyHopper. I've been browsing the Unni app long enough to know that these prices were absurdly high.

The choice to use BeautyHopper is fine since the amenities are great (airport transfers, translator, assistance, covered medications, etc) but despite them saying these extra services are free, you're basically paying for it in the higher price of the surgeries.

I was initially interested in JT Clinic the most, but then I saw the promotional event prices for Woori on Unnii. Another thing I really liked is that there were reviews for almost every procedure I wanted done from Woori. I also really wanted to do Rejuran under anesthesia and there was also a promotion for it!

Woori was the only one who suggested tacking on Under Eye Fat Grafting, and normally I would mind a business pushing additional procedures but I actually was thinking about this myself just cause I don't have heavy bags under my eyes and it is more hollow in the tear trough area. They have also been the most responsive and hospitable over virtual consultation.

1jddg3h,SeoulPlasticSurgery,Miho Plastic Surgery review,"In November, I started by reaching out to over 10+ clinics online via WhatsApp. Some were ""factories"", and some were smaller ones. The industry must really be booming because, wow, reply rates were bad. I think at least half of them ghosted me at some point. Could be a year-end influx thing.

I met Kevin online and he seemed really nice. He was a lot more patient, friendly, and helpful compared to the others who I felt gave me rushed responses, as if they didn't want my business. Prices were transparent enough, he quoted me online and the final prices were the same as promised. He didn't push for any extra surgeries, and most importantly the doctors turned down some of my requests as they felt I was not a good candidate. Definitely a good sign.

I had the following done:

- forehead lift
- upper and bottom lip reduction
- buccal fat reduction
- rhinoplasty with autologous septal and ear cartilage, alar base reduction and bulbous nose reduction
- Rejuran, skin Botox
- 10Therma and Liftera

Three doctors in total operated on me:
- Dr. Jungwoon Yoon
- Dr. Sukho Yoon
- Dr. Heeyong Kang

It was a super long surgery, over 7 hours! I felt horrible when I woke up. I think I was out for way too long. I could barely get home. If you know you don't do very well with sedation, please come to Korea with someone to take care of you. I was fortunate enough that Kevin personally drove me home and walked me to my hotel room. I don't think I could have done it alone.

Judy was my English translator, she is pleasant and perfectly fluent. Though Kevin's English is equally good, so it wasn't really necessary. She tended to me when Kevin was busy. Judy helped me buy my medication (the clinic does not provide meds) and microwavable porridge and pumpkin juice when I was having the surgery. I really appreciate these minor gestures that I think you wouldn't get with a factory clinic.

2 weeks in:
I'm still bruised up and swollen. My face does seem thinner, slightly gaunt even. My scalp is completely numb, but this seems normal as per my research, I hope the sensation returns over time. My eyes are definitely bigger, I technically didn't do any eyelid related surgeries so the result isn't as dramatic as I would have liked. Nose looks bad in its current state due to the swelling, it kinda looks like a pig's nose. I have faith it'll improve in time, so I shan't be impatient.",2025-03-17 14:06:16+00:00,7,11

EDIT: 
Hi everyone, I’ve had many requesting a follow up! So sorry I’m still in Korea and then Japan, so trying to find time to type out the review! 

I’ll edit again later with prices when I’m able to sit and look back at the receipt. 

For now, I’ll explain how the afternoon went. 

I arrived at Cellin Clinic at 4:10pm for my appointment at 4:30pm. 
It’s a little tricky to find the main entrance, but once you do, you can see that on the elevator floor map, there are loads of clinics in the building. I think every floor was a different clinic. 

So I arrived at 4:10, checked in and initially they scanned my passport and then returned it. I was told to wait and I would be called for the doctor consultation. 

I waited a lot long time. I don’t think I was seen till 5:20pm. There were maybe a handful of people waiting, but I honestly felt that they were sent back for the consultation and procedures faster than I was. I will note most of these people came in groups. Groups of 3 or more. I noticed the lady’s up front spoke Chinese, Japanese, English and perhaps other languages, but I only noted those foreign languages being spoken around me. I did seen some Koreans come in, but mostly foreigners. 

The consultation process: after waiting and what felt like ages, I was send by a Dr. Baek. He was Korean but spoke perfectly impeccable English. He was very kind, and simply asked what my goals for my skin we’re. He spoke about different options, but I already had in mind what I wanted. 

I knew I wanted Botox for my forehead lines and jaw and traptox. And my chin as it’s uneven (he did say filler would accomplish the actual goal, but that we could try filler first) As well as rejuran and potenza. For skin texture and pore size. I also wanted ulthera, for my lower jaw line and double chin. 

(I will note, it’s important to kind of know what you want. At no point was I pressured to get something done…with one exception which I’ll mention in a sec. But I think taking the time to look at other websites or skin clinics that have in depth descriptions of procedures and the affects that these procedures will accomplish for your skin. ) 

So I described my concerns and ideas. He agreed to them all saying they were good choices. Especially for a beginner. Towards the end of the discussion he said, “your lips are small, you should do lip filler. “ 
I was not offended as I have gone back and forth with this idea for many years to begin with. So I asked my necessary questions about filler and decided to go along with it. 

He leaves then a front desk girl comes in to talk about pricing. Botox and fillers have different prices. The amount of cc per injection will have different prices. And well as the number of “shots” recommended for the ulthera. 
They have a little booklet with the prices and you can choose from different prices ranges for the filler and Botox. 

Once we went through everything and I picked what I could afford they draw up the receipt and you pay first! Before anything is done. 

Once payment was completed I was led out of the room to then be taken to the locker area to put my stuff away and change into a robe and slippers. 
You are told to wash your face. 

You then wait in another smaller waiting area. 
They will come in and call your name. 

How I saw it, you do laser things first then needle things last. 
So I was taken to a small room where the ulthera machine was. Numbing cream was spread all over my face. I took a little nap, 15-20 lying in the room alone. 
Someone came in and took the cream off, then proceeded with the ulthera. 
It’s done about 3-4 times per section of face by a little hand held laser maybe the thickness of 2 to 3 pencils put together. They will alternate from side to side. This took a while. The initial and second go over didn’t hurt at all nor did I feel anything. I will compare it to those little handheld wands you can buy to zap your face. Nuderma. Or similar to medicubes wand but in the strongest setting. 
The 3rd go around I definitely felt and it was stronger. But not unbearable. 

Once that was done I was lead to a different room. Where the doctor did potenza. Think micro needling but 5 times stronger. It hurt. I was tearing and bleeding but it was still kinda bearable. 

After was Botox. Very simple and straight forward. 

Next was rejuran. The famous salmon sperm. And Jesus Christ above. When I tell you this hurt. I mean I almost passed out several times. I didn’t. I have to have the doctor stop several times and let me breathe. 
He mentioned I seemed to bleed very easily. So there was a lot of dripping for me. He constantly has to stop and dab/wipe my face. He was very patient and kind but it got to the point where I said keep going and don’t stop. I wanted it done and FAST! 

I have a high pain tolerance. Really. I enjoy watching my blood get drawn, I’ve never had an issue with needles or pain. But when I tell you this hurt. This about took me out! I should have done more research regarding the pain tolerance for this procedure! So please be aware and look at other options. 
Apparently there are some clinics that can put you to sleep, there is also another type of rejuran that has something else in it so it’s not as painful. Of course I was told this after. But it’s my fault as I told the doctor I have a high pain tolerance during the initial discussion phase. 
As a final warning, this procedure caused me serious emotional damage. I ended up sitting in the bathroom when I left crying for a good few minutes letting out all the emotions I felt and couldn’t let others see. IT HURT THAT BAD! 

Next I was sent to another room where the lip filler was done. I didn’t have any reference pictures so I told the girl to just keep my shape just a little bigger. She went with her instincts and injected away. 

Next was the traptox. I did ask for numbing cream as I had heard this also hurts. And it certainly did. But not as bad as rejuran. They just jab you quickly and don’t really concentrate on inserting the needle slowly. Just imagine, jab, push in fluid, then take out and jab again. This was done around 5 times in the traps. 

Lastly I was led to another room where a spot I had wanted removed was shot with a laser. You are given a skin /upf pimple patch looking sticker to cover the spot. I will need to keep it covered for 7 days but I plan to do it longer as I scar easily. 

You can buy these patches along with the medications prescribed to you at the pharmacy across the street. 
Before you leave you are reminded what and what not to do. And given your medications. 

The whole thing took maybe 4ish hours. I did think I was there way too long. The doctor mentioned “you came when it was light now it’s dark”

So I think he even thought it was a long process. 

All in all a good experience. But be aware of the rejuran. ",2025-03-08 01:40:50+00:00,3,21

1j52rtp,SkinBySeoul,Unlocking Youthful Skin with Korean and Hanbang Skincare,"The quest for youthful, radiant skin often leads us to Korean skincare, famous for its innovative and effective anti-aging solutions. Whether it’s the high-tech benefits of PDRN-based products or the herbal richness of Hanbang skincare, these products are designed to target wrinkles, fine lines, and loss of elasticity—all while nourishing your skin. If you’ve been feeling overwhelmed by the choices, take a deep breath. This guide is here to simplify the options and help you create a targeted, consistent routine to reduce signs of aging.

# Why Opt for Korean Skincare for Anti-Aging?

What sets Korean skincare apart is its multifaceted approach to anti-aging. Instead of focusing solely on quick fixes, it emphasizes hydration, repair, and prevention. The formulations balance advanced technologies like PDRN (a powerful regenerating ingredient) with traditional herbal extracts (Hanbang), creating products that work harmoniously with the skin to restore a youthful glow.

# Top Anti-Aging Korean Products

# PDRN-Based Products

PDRN (polynucleotide) is renowned for its regenerative properties, promoting cell renewal and improving elasticity.

|**Product**|**Key Ingredients**|**Benefits**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Rejuran Healer Ampoule|PDRN|Boosts skin elasticity, smooths fine lines|
|Dr. Hedison PDRN Serum|PDRN, Peptides|Repairs skin, fights wrinkles|

# Hanbang Essentials

Hanbang products are infused with herbal extracts, prized for their natural anti-aging abilities.

|**Product**|**Key Ingredients**|**Benefits**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Yehwadam Revitalizing Toner|Ginseng, Honey|Hydrates, firms, and nourishes|
|Sulwhasoo Concentrated Ginseng Serum|Korean Ginseng, Licorice Root|Improves texture, reduces fine lines|
|Beauty of Joseon Revive Eye Serum|Ginseng, Retinal|Smooths wrinkles, brightens under-eyes|

# Hydrating and Firming Moisturizers

Seal in moisture and amplify anti-aging results with the right cream.

|**Product**|**Key Ingredients**|**Benefits**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Sulwhasoo Timetreasure Invigorating Cream|Pine Extract, Ginseng|Hydration, firmness|
|Missha Yu Ryeo Whitening Cream|Rice Extract, Niacinamide|Brightens, softens wrinkles|

# Budget-Friendly Alternatives

If you’re looking for affordable but effective options, try **The Saem Urban Eco Harakeke Cream** for intense hydration or **Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence** for repair and resilience. Both work wonders for early signs of aging!

# Q&A Section

# How do I layer my anti-aging products?

Start with a gentle cleanser to prep your skin. Follow up with a toner (such as Yehwadam Revitalizing Toner) to hydrate. Next comes your serum or ampoule (PDRN or herbal), then lock it all in with a moisturizer. Don’t forget sunscreen during the daytime!

# How long does it take to see results?

Anti-aging is a marathon, not a sprint. While hydration and plumpness can show up within a few weeks, significant wrinkle reduction can take 2-3 months of regular use.

# Can I mix herbal and PDRN-based products?

Absolutely! PDRN and Hanbang products complement each other beautifully. For example, you can use a PDRN serum at night and a herbal moisturizer during the day to balance your routine.

# What’s a minimalist anti-aging routine?

Stick to a cleanser, a PDRN-based serum, and a moisturizer for a simple starter routine. Add sunscreen during the day—it’s a must!

# What should I avoid while focusing on anti-aging?

Avoid products with alcohol, artificial fragrances, or harsh exfoliants, as they can exacerbate skin issues and accelerate aging.

1j3jai1,DIYCosmeticProcedures,Favorite treatments for PIE? (post inflammatory erythema),"this is my biggest skin issue — uneven tone due to pie. 

i don’t have a lot of acne but get the occasional spots, especially on my chin around my period. i’ve been using a plasma wand, spironolactone, and plan to add azelaic acid as well — the treatments i’ve added have already helped significantly in managing new spots from forming. i also have a red light panel on the way!

i’ve been targeting spots with meso’d Rejuran S every couple of weeks which seems to be doing a good job of fading them, but honestly would prefer to save the syringes i have for stretch mark treatment!

i’m also considering trying something like snow flower bloom to promote overall evenness of tone. i have seen good B&As that show results for redness reduction. has anyone used this / any thoughts on it (or comparable products that are potentially better-formulated? e.g. despite higher cost, would it be better to just do a course of rejuran healer? or has curenex helped anyone with PIE?)

also considering v-beam laser or BBL — i know these are treatments of choice for PIE — but would obviously prefer to DIY due to cost / wanting to manage treatment myself if i can!

i know BB Glow microneedling is controversial, but also curious if anyone has used it and liked it?

1j1prcf,DIYaesthetics,Questions about Nucleofill bumps,"
TLDR; latest round of Nucleofill stung a lot more with longer lasting bumps compared to before, but has also been more effective. What gives? 



Hi all, googled this but couldn’t find anything, hoping someone here could shed some lights on it.

I’ve had both Rejuran and Nucleofill injected, the bumps faded away without hours for Rejuran, and for my first couple Nucleofill injections. 

However, for my 2/4 round of Nucleofill, it didn’t feel like it was doing much, I chalked it up to maybe I’m maybe just not seeing it since I’ve been staring into the mirror every day to observe (been getting Nucleofill once every two weeks for the past 4 weeks at that time, and 2 rounds of Rejuran right before) 


Had my 3/4 round of Nucleofill yesterday, same injector, but it was a lot more painful, and the bumps linger a lot longer- they usually faded completely in a couple hours, but the bumps are still there right now after ~36 hours. Not visible, but I can feel them by touch. 

The injecting part wasn’t painful since they kept the numbing cream on longer, but the sting after the needle was in was significantly worse. Previously, the sting was minimal before. 

The results of this round are MUCH better though and VERY noticeable so I am wondering if this means my injector injected it deeper or anything. 

Thoughts, anyone?

1is42aq,beauty,For those of you over 40 - who don't want to do plastic surgery - what do you do to look your best?,"About 2 years ago age slapped me in the face - hard. Most days I don't even turn on the light in my bathroom because I see an old lady looking back rather than the pretty young thing I used to be. So all last year I was like ""face lift!""

But - while I've always been an exerciser and (at least thought) ate healthy - I've become even more so in the last 2 years. Totally cleaned up my diet and lost 25lbs (that I didn't even know where there although my 36DDs certainly did). 

And I think that ""diet face"" has aged me as well 😪.

So .... last year, under the gun because I was going to a big wedding, I loaded up with filler ...

And hated the $$$$ I spent AND that with how ""all natural"" I'd become over the last few years I'd put that crap in my face. I won't again. 

OH and I felt I looked not one iota better. Just poorer.

BUT since my face had thinned out - making everything worse - I started thinking facelift.

However I'd like to find an alternative (rather than lining the already wealthy pockets of a plastic surgeon) and learn to love my face (though not just let it go) and why put my now older self under anesthesia?

So is there anything that REALLY helps that is non invasive? I've used plenty of serums and moisturizers but frankly I think we're all getting sold alot of quackery with these products.

1iq0wu4,koreatravel,Myeongdong Aesthetic Clinics – My Go-To Recommendations,"Hey everyone! I travel to Seoul often for business and usually stay near Seoul Station, so I spend a lot of time in Myeongdong. Since foreign friends always ask me for skincare clinic recommendations, I thought I’d share my personal experiences with a few foreigner-friendly places I’ve visited. For context, I regularly get lifting and Rejuran treatments, so I’m pretty familiar with these kinds of clinics. Here’s the breakdown:

Abijou Myeongdong
This place is a staple in Myeongdong. It’s spacious, has parking, and the staff are generally friendly. They even have a coffee machine for a quick drink, which was fun. But it’s usually packed, and the busy atmosphere makes it feel a bit rushed. It’s a solid option for quick and affordable treatments, but don’t expect a luxury experience.

Daybeau Myeongdong
This one’s a gem. It’s fairly new and has a premium concept. A Korean friend suggested it, and I’m so glad they did. From the moment I walked in, the clean, modern interior and calming vibe stood out. The staff were super attentive and professional—they explained everything clearly, and I really felt like I was being taken care of. The minimum spend policy was worth it because the entire experience was relaxing and efficient without feeling crowded. My skin looked amazing after the treatment. This is now my go-to clinic when I’m in Myeongdong. Highly recommend if you want a premium but not intimidating experience.

Vands Myeongdong
Located on the 11th floor of the same building as Daybeau. It’s known for affordable treatments, and the staff are kind and efficient. There was a bit of a wait, but the service overall was decent. Great for budget treatments without sacrificing too much on quality.

If you’re looking for skincare in Myeongdong, Daybeau Myeongdong is the clear winner for me. It’s perfect if you want to feel pampered while getting great results. Anyone else have Myeongdong recs? Drop them in the comments! 😊",2025-02-15 13:04:35+00:00,0,4
1ipmmec,DIYCosmeticProcedures,Rejuran newbie meso questions,"Hi all, 

Firstly, so incredibly thankful to this empowering community! Prior to finding this group I had done some low-level DIY (peels, micro needling) and had been seeing some great improvements with this. I also got Sculptra (professionally done) last year with lovely results. Now thanks to this group I have switched to DIY botox, and plan to look into meso next for the chef’s kiss. I bought the Biohacking Beauty meso guide too, to prepare. I’m a U.S. MD and feel very comfortable with injections/aseptic technique, although doing stuff to my own face makes me want to start very VERY conservatively. 

Now, I am interested in diving into Rejuran mesotherapy as Rejuran seems to be most respected for meso. If anyone has input on the following specific questions and concerns, it’d be appreciated!

1. I’m 37yo with overall youthful skin, but my concerns (in this order) are fine nasolabial lines, mild skin dullness, dark undereye circles, and faint acne scars (albeit much improved with TCA peels). Does anyone just start with treating the most “needy” areas rather than the entire face? I have two kids, a time-intensive job, and a full meso face sounds pretty time-consuming. 
2. I’d like to move straight to Rejuran, but I suppose I can trial Curenex or something like this first - should I practice with a more “basic” PDRN first?
3. Would 1.5mm 34g needles be sufficient for Rejuran? I like the idea of 1.5mm, with a nice teeny needle, because then I can go at a 90 deg angle straight into the skin for my bleb and not have to deal with figuring out an angle with a 4mm. But open to hearing otherwise - Biohacking Beauty guide supports this idea. 
4. There are a few Rejuran options out there - I’m thinking Healer Trueskin Essence, unless I should consider something else? Would this be ok to use carefully undereye? On Meamo, Elaskin Essence just popped up, and I’m considering this too. 
5. Are two 2ml syringes usually enough for the full face? 
6. Expected downtime for Rejuran?
7. How frequently do you change your needle tip with meso?
8. What is the build-up routine recommended + maintenance? I’m seeing about every 2-4 weeks…for how many cycles, and then what is recommended maintenance?

1ipb2ji,koreatravel,Fine clinic review,"After reading multiple online reviews , watching their ig videos and trying other chain clinic, i decided to try out Fine clinic as i would like to get a slightly  more invasive procedure. 

Pro: 
consultation by doctor ( but you couldn’t chose your doctor even by specifically request) . The doctor is also seems to be in a rush during consultation. 

Cons: 
1) even though you are consulted by a doctor , a different doctor might be performing the procedure for you. 
2) at least 30 % more expensive than other factory clinic . But the experience to be honest , not much different. 
3) i did rejuran injection and filler. They didnt show me the packaging of the product nor the labels before or after. The other clinic i went to actually does so and there is a nfc tag for authentication. 

If you are thinking you need a doctor consultation , then yes probably is still worth the visit. But if you already know what you need , then choosing a factory clinic is of no difference.

1inr796,koreatravel,Myeongdong Counterfeit Skincare Products?,"I was shopping in Myeongdong and saw several skincare stores (10+ stores, not olive young, in the area).

As a foreigner I would highly recommend doing skincare treatments in Seoul anywhere BUT Ppeum clinic 😭 

I went yesterday because I saw a promo ad for neck rejuran. Appointment was easy to make on the day of via WhatsApp and the wait time was short (well the clinic was empty) 

Consultant barely looked at me before she tried to sell me several different and more expensive procedures for my face. I decided to add Juvelook since I already had been interested in trying it and there was also a promo, but politely declined the others. The only way I could get her to stop talking over me though was by saying I had already done other treatments (ulthera, rejuran HB, potenza, etc) within the last few days so I couldn’t do it again in such a short time. She looked like she was angry with me and then tried to give me the highest dosage for neck botox, and when I said I only wanted 200c she took my cash without a word and came back with my change - 16000 KRW short. I asked her where the rest of my change was and all of a sudden her English skills started failing 😂 so I pointed at her calculator and coins she had given me (160 KRW) and was like does this seem right to you? Then she proceeded to slowly count the money I had given her and then the coins she gave me and was finally like oh sorry and gave me my change. 

The girl who was numbing my face also missed several spots, and I had to ask someone else to do it again.. for what it’s worth, the guy who did my actual procedure did fine. Also at the end, he had trouble finding space to put the neck tox - he said he had 2cc left to place on my neck and couldn’t find space for it due to lack of surface area 🥲 imagine if I had listened and gotten 400cc?! 

The last thing I noticed today was the kicker that made me write this post: at the end of my procedures, I had a tiny freckle removed with Co2 laser. Afterwards they placed 2 duoderm protective stickers over it for healing. BUT the space between the two stickers was aligned exactly over the freckle that was removed. Meaning it was never covered or protected at all 😭

All goes to show that it’s so important to do your homework and advocate for yourself or in the very least stay vigilant I guess? Haha I hope my poor experience was just a one off thing, but I know several people (like me) travel to Korea to do skincare procedures and would hate for them to waste your money on such a subpar experience like this.

1ijpd5p,BeautySkincareHealth,🌟 WHAT IS A SKINBOOSTER 🌟,"✨🥰✨ WHAT IS A SKIN BOOSTER? ✨🥰✨

What’s your favourite skin booster? 

A skin booster is a product that normally includes a mix of hyaluronic acid, vitamins, minerals, peptides, and other nutrients. Is it normally injected into the skin to improve hydration, texture, and overall appearance. 

It can help with fine lines, wrinkles, dullness, and dehydration, giving the skin a more youthful glow and radiant appearance.

💉DO SKIN BOOSTERS NEED TO BE INJECTED?  

Injecting skin boosters is a common and effective method for delivering the active ingredients directly into the skin. This allows for precise targeting of specific areas and ensures maximum absorption of the nutrients, resulting in noticeable improvements in hydration, texture, and overall skin quality.

But there are alternative treatment methods for skin boosters, such as virtual mesotherapy or microneedling, which can also be effective in delivering the active ingredients to the skin without the need for injections. 

These methods may be suitable for people who prefer non-invasive treatments or not use needles.

1ijn15m,DIYCosmeticProcedures,Skinbooster recommendations for brighter skin tone? And for dark eye circles?,"Hi everyone! So I have completed one course of Rejuran Healer (4x spaced 3-4 weeks apart, 2 syringes each time), then moved on to one course of Rejuran HB+ (3x, 3 weeks apart). 
My skin is definitely better than when I first started - Rejuran Healer has cured my facial eczema and rosacea completely, plus helps control oiliness on my face. And I was able to see a slightly more hydrated skin texture from Rejuran HB. But overall my skin isn’t where I want it to be yet. I still have some concerns with hyperpigmentation and acne scars, and my dark eye circles are still prominent. 

I am not sure if I should continue using Rejuran H or HB+ for monthly maintenance as it’s really expensive doing this long term. Any experience with mesoing Rejuran Tone Up or Rejuran Elaskin Essence? I am also considering Lapuroon Aurora S and Elaxen PDRN. 

And what product would you recommend for dark under eye circles? I have injected Rejuran HB+ under my eyes, but it doesn’t seem to work for this purpose. I have yet to try Rejuran i. 

I’ve tried Kiara Reju and Regenovue Aqua Shine (silver) and found it super hard to push during meso, and ended up using them for micro needling. I use 31g 4mm for reference.

I did one session of meso (Rejuran) and it went OK I think, there is a bit of a learning curve but I'm overall satisfied with how it went. A couple questions before I try my next session:
1) for meso, is it sufficient to just wash your face with micellar water + cleanser beforehand? Or is it necessary to use alcohol? That really dried my skin out last time so I'm hesitant to do it again. (My skin is very sensitive).
2) any tips to prevent bruising? I only got one bruise and I think it was because I injected too big of a bump in that area. Don't plan on doing that again. But any advice is welcome!

1ii406i,KoreanBeauty,PDRN VS REJURAN HB PLUS,"Hey everyone!

I recently started PDRN treatments to help with some mild spots and uneven skin tone, but I’ve been wondering—what’s the difference between PDRN and Rejuran? I know both are used for skin regeneration and improving overall skin quality, but I’d love to understand their specific differences in terms of composition, benefits, and effectiveness.

From what I’ve read, PDRN (Polydeoxyribonucleotide) is a type of DNA fragment derived from salmon that helps with cell repair, collagen production, and overall skin healing. It’s known for its anti-inflammatory and regenerative properties, making it great for addressing acne scars, pigmentation, and skin rejuvenation.

On the other hand, Rejuran is also made from salmon DNA but is often marketed as a more concentrated skin booster for deep hydration, elasticity, and anti-aging. I’ve heard it’s particularly effective for improving skin texture and reducing fine lines, whereas PDRN is more about healing and repair.

If anyone has experience with both, how do they compare in terms of results? Would Rejuran be a better option for overall brightening and anti-aging, or is PDRN enough for mild pigmentation issues?

Also any comments on the after effects if you stop doing either ? :) 


Looking forward to your insights! Thanks in advance!

I’ve had a variety of skin procedures done over time—**masseter (jaw) & forehead Botox**, **Accu injections**, **InMode FX**, **lip fillers**, **Picosure toning**, **Ultherapy**, **Rejuran HB**, **Rejuran Eye**, and more.

When I first came to Korea, I thought, “The cheaper, the better,” but after a few experiences at factory-style clinics, I realized I’d rather pay a reasonable mid-range price for better care and personalized attention.

# Treatments This Time:

I had some pretty severe hollowness under my eyes and wanted to tighten my skin, so after doing a lot of research, I booked my appointment through the Cellin Clinic Hongdae’s website. I went with:

* **Ultracol** for collagen stimulation (undereye)
* **Rejuran** for skin regeneration (whole face)
* **Ultherapy** focused on my jawline
* **Excel V Laser** for skin redness

I decided to get everything done in one day to reduce the downtime.

* **Ultherapy & Rejuran:** Similar pain levels—definitely felt the discomfort, but tolerable with numbing. I need a lot of mental preparation prior to Rejuran.
* **Excel V & Ultracol:** Much more bearable, like mild stinging or snapping sensations.

# Clinic Experience:

* **English-speaking staff** made the whole process smooth.
* I specifically requested **Dr. Jihye Yeom** after reading great reviews. The clinic informed me about her off days and potential waiting times, so I planned accordingly.
* **Dr. Yeom** did all the injections herself, and she also speaks English, which was a huge plus.
* The entire process took around **1.5 hours**.
* The clinic was **clean, organized, and not overcrowded**—definitely not a factory-like vibe.
* They also offer **tax refunds**, which was a nice bonus.

# Cost:

I paid **$1,800** for all the procedures. It’s not exactly cheap, but compared to the prices in the US, it’s a bargain for the quality and results I got.

Let me know if you have any questions—I’d be happy to share more details!

1ihdp3a,KoreanBeauty,"Rejuran HB, Thermage flx, Excel V and light Botox","My goodness. I went to a skin clinic (The H face up in Gangnam)  in Seoul and purchased the listed treatments. Numbing cream was used for my Rejuran healer and I picked the HB option. And mother of all that’s holy, it still was painful. 
I have taken photos and will post some before and after pictures in about 4-8 weeks. 
I will say this clinic was wonderful, I felt the bedside manner was great for a Korean clinic. It was smaller and some treatments were more expensive. However all of my chosen treatments were administered by Dr. Hwang as well as the consultation. The assistants helped with prep and clean up etc. When finished I was even helped walking downstairs to the pharmacy to get my antihistamines and my taxi was called for me. 
My total cost for all treatments was about $2,200. I got 8cc of Rejuran healer, Excel V all over my face and Thermage flx 600REP all over face and neck. I purchased 6cc of Rejuran but Dr. Hwang included the extra 2cc (he decided during treatment, after I had paid he would give me 2 extra cc). This was my full face and eyes. 
I paid $700 for 3 treatments of cheeks only VBeam in the states. This was my full face and I also got light Botox. 
In my opinion, even though on the higher end — treatments were still a very good deal. 
I will be taking my Mom next time I go to Seoul. ",2025-02-04 09:10:49+00:00,11,9

Skin gets swollen all the time. And it’s dropping from the lack of facial fat for support. Just wonder what can trigger further fat loss can it be prevented and is it likely to happen further? I suffered initial fat loss then further around 6 weeks and again 2 weeks after. Seems stable since then but I’m always worried. I’m wanting to do Botox in a month or so has anyone had issues after and I’m also think if a skin booster is a good idea like one that has HA and amino acids and vitamins that are injected into the skin to improve skin health. It doesn’t add volume but hydrating the skin can plump it up or doing rejuran for the redness. I’ve been just keeping it simple to this point but I’m at the point I’m so depressed and unhappy and wish I could look the way I did again and need to try something!

I honestly could have not gone through this entire process without her. She was very informative and helped me throughout all these procedures. Dr Jung Joosung did my chin lipo, tip lasty, and juvelook procedure. He also spoke English. This was a huge plus for me. It put me more at ease with who was going take care of me during my major surgeries and that my expectations and concerns were understood. Dr Cha Bo Hwan did my rejuran procedure. Although he didn’t speak English, Yunji was able to translate for me. Woori Plastic Surgery was very accommodating and did their best to meet all my needs and answered all my questions.

- every 2-3 weeks meso Pdrn and PN (Rejuran and metoo healer - some curenex mixed in)

- definitely had to put more than I thought when I first started used 4ml (both syringes) of Rejuran per face per session and a good 2 vials of the metoo pdrn and a curenex Per session. Give or take. This was the most I ever put. 

I also do red light after and a collegen or curenex mask after which I think relaxes it

For days 1-6, I basically did as instructed: wash 2x a day with gentle cleanser (Face Reality Barrier Cleanser), antibiotic ointment, and lots of aquaphor. Also stayed inside. On day 7, I added Neogenesis Recovery Serum underneath the aquaphor to speed up the healing process. If i step out for a short period, i wear SPF 50. So far, so good.

1i2bbqd,SeoulPlasticSurgery,Woori Plastic Surgery - under eye fat repositioning ,"It’s been about a month and a half since my procedures at Woori and I want to share my experience. I opted to do a handful of skincare treatments since I would already be under anesthesia for lower eye fat repositioning. In total, I did a lower eye fat repositioning, ulthera, juvelook, rejuran, forehead and jaw Botox.

Pre-operation: I reached out to Woori through their English Instagram page to inquire about the procedures about 2 months before I knew I was going to be in Korea. I essentially had a consultation with the doctors through the English coordinators on the Ig chat through sending them photos and having them send back the doctor’s recommendation. The coordinators were responsive and answered all my questions, also provided info on pricing all through Instagram messaging. At this point I was assigned a doctor, so to lock in my surgery date I sent a deposit via PayPal.

Day of: Right when I got in I had my photos taken, and was sent upstairs for intake. Once checked in, I went over costs and consent forms with the English coordinator. Afterwards, I met with the doctor for a consultation with the English coordinator present for translations. I explained my specific concerns and he advised on what I could reasonably expect with the surgery. He marked up my face and I was off to change and get ready for surgery.  Before I knew it, I was on the operating table and knocked out… then awake and laying in the resting area with bandages under my eyes. No pain at all, but I did go back to sleep for an hour before I was released from the clinic.

Week after: My entire face was quite swollen. Red marks everywhere from the injections to which later turned into bruising for about 2 weeks. I used Arnica gel to heal from the swelling/bruising faster. Once I removed the under eye bandages 3 days later, I could immediately tell the eye bags were gone. I noticed the whole eye area looked a bit swollen/looked like it’s  changing every week afterward so it definitely takes about a month to heal.

Almost 6 weeks later - face is noticeable snatched. The tension in my jaw is relieved, and my skin has never looked this good before, ever! Most importantly, my eye area swelling has gone down and the eye bags are gone. Overall, I’m very pleased with the results so far!",2025-01-15 23:42:48+00:00,30,16

This is the link for the photos.  
I love the results!! This is the first time to do this and​ I'm very happy!  I'll definitely do this again!!!!

I bought 50% TCA from Kimistri Labs. I diluted the solution with 1/3 water to make it 30% since it's my first time. My cheeks have dark acne spots, pitted scars, wide pores, and some box scars on my temples and side cheeks. I tried PRP microneedling before for my scars, CO2 laser, Rejuran S once, but it didn't ​address the scars, spots, and discoloration long-term, plus they were very expensive.

I started to feel collagen and redness minutes after the treatment. It felt like an ant bite 🐜, so I didn't need to use numbing cream. This process is less uncomfortable, I believe, than doing a 15% TCA peel, which is itchy, wrinkly, crinkly, and dry, and I fear not peeling and having to do 2-3 more sessions after a peel. On the second day, I saw that my skin discoloration had improved. The pitted scars are filled with scabs, and I think they will be raised by 40-60% I am ​excited while waiting for the scabs to fall off in 7-10 days. I don't want to rub or pick my face. I am using emu oil, rosehip oil, and Biafine emollient after the treatment.

The other photos on the before and after are before the Rejuran S and co2 laser 1x​. I had some red keloids on my cheeks from subcision, but they healed before I did the TCA Cross 30% on myself.

I want to know if my skin looks normal on the 3rd day of TCA Cross. Did I do the procedure right? What do you guys think?

I got the worst breakouts while I was on Salmon oil Omega 3 (a good brand; Thorne). Im worried if I get salmon DNA injection, I would get cystic acne from it. Am I being paranoid or is it not at all related?

1htb4fb,30PlusSkinCare,Why is no one talking about Renuva? ,"Edited to include the following: 
Hi I’m a real person this isn’t an ad. I have written other post in this sub, very very recently this one here [guide to lasers](https://www.reddit.com/r/30PlusSkinCare/comments/1hrl7vg/my_guide_to_cosmetic_lasers_and_laser_skin/)
If you are downvoting the comments and discussion can you please take a moment to explain why? I’m unclear what it is about the topic that is being criticized. Thank you! 

I recently learned about Renuva in a pretty roundabout way, which is strange considering how promising it seems.

A month ago, I had a surgical fat grafting done to my face. Why? Because I'm a vain POS and fully embrace it. Also, my temporal hollowing and tear trough deformity were significant enough to use the medical term when referring to them. Filler wasn't going to cut it. 

Jump to today, I was at the dermatologists for a totally unrelated reason. I was being a silly goose, gave myself a permanent black eye with Rejuran i, and I now needed an adult to fix it. After we established I was no longer allowed to play with PN injectables at home, we got on the topic of the fat graft.  

Turns out, Renuva is an injectable that essentially works as a **fat graft alternative**, encouraging your body to regenerate its own fat over time. Not only that- it can be used within three months of a fat graft to encourage the survival rate and feed the nascent tissue.  

Here’s the breakdown of what I’ve learned:

**What Is Renuva?**

* It’s a treatment made from a matrix of collagen, proteins, and growth factors.
* The goal is to restore lost volume and improve skin texture by stimulating your body to naturally produce fat cells.
* It’s often used for areas like the face, hands, and small body regions affected by volume loss.
* Renuva and fat grafting can be combined strategically to enhance the results of facial or body volume restoration. While they serve slightly different purposes, they complement each other in achieving a more natural and lasting rejuvenation.

**How It Works**:

* It’s injected into the targeted area, where it integrates with your tissue and encourages fat growth over a few months.
* Results are gradual but long-lasting, supposedly lasting years as the new fat becomes a natural part of your tissue.

**Why I’m Intrigued**:

* As someone over 30 who has started noticing volume loss in my face and hands (hello, fun words like tear trough deformity and emotional hollowness), this seems like an exciting alternative to fillers.
* It’s less invasive than traditional fat grafting procedures and doesn’t require the downtime or risk of surgery.
* It’s marketed as a way to create a more natural look since the results are from *your* body’s own fat.

**Potential Downsides**:

* It’s not cheap. But it might be kinda weird if it was...  
* Results take time to show, so this isn’t a quick fix like traditional fillers.
* Not everyone is a candidate; it seems best for smaller areas rather than large volume restoration.

**My Questions for You All**:

* Have any of you tried Renuva? What was your experience like?
* How did the results compare to fillers or fat grafting?

I’d love to hear your thoughts, especially if you’ve done your research or have experience with this treatment. For me, it feels like a promising step forward in cosmetic science, but I’m curious to hear from the hive mind of this community!",2025-01-04 09:47:13+00:00,21,86
1htb1w9,koreatravel,Am I being trapped by this acne scar treatment quotes ,"
I went to Wonjin Clinic in Gangnam and was quoted for the following treatments for acne scars:

A) Potenza RF Laser

B) Xcar (CO2 Gas Subcision): Injecting high-pressure carbon dioxide (CO2) gas into the dermis with a needle.

C) Rejuran and HA Filler: I requested Rejuran S because I read online that it’s better for acne scars than the original Rejuran. However, the doctor recommended combining the original Rejuran with RF Potenza Laser instead. He mentioned that if I want to use Rejuran S, it’s better to use it alone without the laser. I’m not sure if that’s true or not.

D) Post-Procedure: Healing mask and red light therapy to reduce swelling. That’s all they suggested.

They quoted me 1,500,000 KRW (around $1,000 USD). Does this seem overpriced for these treatments? I’d appreciate any suggestions or advice",2025-01-04 09:41:58+00:00,0,7

1). Fillers - Neuramis Deep and Volume , Tesoro Sub Q, Elasty G. Too risky to try on Dec 31, as in will cause puffiness which won’t subside in time? One is a lip filler - (my lips are not full right now) others fillers forthe sulcus between mandible and jawline, medial check to potentially fill under tear trough area where I still have a depression despite using Lilied K and Rejuran I - am wondering if the issue is lack of fullness in my anterior/medial cheeks?) and finally lateral cheekbone (zygomatic arch), then temples, as well. All have crosslinked HA. 

2) Iniblanc PCL : for fullness and lift at forehead, temples - overall upper face which continues through cheeks 

3) P198 Exosome (used almost a month ago) 

4) Dermaheal HSR 

5) Velatox GF-11

6) Illuma Crystal Rose (used about 1.5 months ago)

7) TCA 13% peel (last use three months ago)

8) Lilied K (used about two weeks ago) 

9) Revs Pro 32 

I could order something new if it will arrive in time, so if you have a recommendation you love, please let me know. 

I haven’t done fillers or PCL before so my inexperience might interfere with a good result. I’m not sure if I should attempt, but I included them, anyway. Thanks

I apologize for the ask as it’s a lot - with the various products and the timing. I’m definitely not looking to use all, just listing what I have on hand.

The result the first time was ok I had some enhancement in skin texture and had glowy skin. People around me cominted and I can see 30 % improvement. The second time my skin felt amazing and everyone commented how my skin look radiating and glowy. Skin enhancement was 55%.
The third time i didn’t feel a big difference. It was ok maybe because I waited more than month ? 

- lapuroon aurora super

Active Ingredients
PDRN 2% , peptides (Glutathione), Vitamin A (Retinol), hyaluronic acid 1%.

(2.5ml Syringe x 2) for 98 dollars

I didn’t tried it, we have a lot of clinic that advertise this for 600$ and honestly I read some good reviews about it. I think it will be my next buy. The price is good and have the same percentage of PDRN as rejuran.

(Special Notes) There are many ""counterfeit"" Aurora products circulating on the internet. Ensure to look for the official seal, which confirms the product as authentic, original, and official.


- MCCM PDRN + HA 2%

PDRN , Hyaluronic Acid, Deoxyribonucleic Acid.
( it doesn’t specify the percentage of PDRN but I think it’s 2%?

My plan is to do medical microneedling at the depth suggested by Dr. Pen’s guide, and I'm going to add 20-30 units of botox along with 1-2 ml of Hyaron to the cocktail for better slip.

My skin is generally very good, but I’m looking to improve on texture/pore size, mild acne scarring, some hyperpigmentation and redness.  Added glow and plumpness would also be nice.  I’m also thinking about incorporating Rejuran S meso injections to the acne scars during the same session so I can keep the downtime to a minimum.

If you’ve tried either of these boosters or have any tips for this kind of cocktail, I’d really appreciate your thoughts!",2024-12-27 00:11:14+00:00,24,54
1hmla11,DIYaesthetics,Blebs are blebbing,"Did a half syringe in the each eye area of Rejuran - i. Really happy with the application and not at all concerned about the blebs. They’ve already reduced by about 45% and it was only a few hours ago that i injected. 

Zero bruising, hardly any bleeding, zero pain (k-lido cream works extremely well for eyes), fairly easy to achieve proper technique. Went super superficial and tented the skin (once I skewered my poor little eye skin lol). 

Will post results later.

Video on Skin Boosters: A Deep Dive Into Collagen and Elastin Stimulation


I recently came across an informative video about skin boosters and how to choose the right ones for your skin goals. Looking forward to everyone’s thoughts and experiences on this topic. 

TLDR; avoid primarily type I collagen stimulators for lifting, so Sculptra bad. Rejuran questionable. Profhilo good. 

The speaker, Dr. Abs who has apparently taught thousands of clinicians worldwide, explains what to look for (and avoid!) in skin injectables. I wanted to share my notes from the video and start a discussion about what’s worth it and what’s not. 

Here’s the link to the video: https://youtu.be/tQK7lzZkSZM


Summary of Key Points:
	1.	Collagen Types Matter:
	•	There are 28 types of collagen in the body, but Types I, III, IV, and VII are most relevant to skin health.
	•	For lifting and tightening, collagen types IV and VII (found in the Dermal-Epidermal Junction or DEJ) are crucial. Most products only stimulate Types I and III, which don’t contribute directly to skin lift.
	2.	Elastin is Essential:
	•	Collagen gives the skin structure, but elastin is what makes it elastic and bouncy. Some injectables stimulate elastin, but many don’t.
	3.	Avoid Inflammation-Based Collagen:
	•	Products that rely on inflammation to produce collagen (like some that overproduce Type I) might lead to fibrosis (scar tissue), which can harm skin quality over time.
	4.	Patents Matter:
	•	The speaker emphasizes looking for formula patents (indicating innovative technology) over use patents, which may just be marketing fluff.
	5.	Beware of Foreign DNA:
	•	Some injectables use DNA from foreign species (like salmon), which might sound fancy but can pose risks and lack meaningful evidence for efficacy.

The Speaker’s Recommendations:

The doctor is very careful not to mention any actual products but asks that you piece the info yourself. Here’s what I think the doctor would recommend and caution against:

💡 Likely Recommended:
	1.	Profhilo: Targets collagen Types I, III, and IV, stimulates elastin, and works with the body’s natural processes without causing inflammation. It also directly impacts the DEJ for lifting and tightening.

❌ Likely Not Recommended:
	1.	Sculptra and Lanluma: Both rely on PLLA, which stimulates Type I collagen through inflammation. While they can improve volume, they don’t target DEJ collagen (Types IV and VII) and might contribute to fibrosis.
	2.	Rejuran: Contains salmon DNA, which the speaker criticizes as irrelevant to human physiology. It focuses on Type I collagen, offering more regeneration than lift.
	3.	Possibly Gouri: Uses biodegradable polymers for balanced collagen production, though its impact on the DEJ isn’t fully known.


Discussion:

Have you tried any of these? What was your experience with respect to lift? Do you prioritize lifting, hydration, or regeneration when considering skin boosters? Let’s share our experiences and thoughts!

Remember, this post isn’t medical advice—always consult with a licensed and experienced professional before trying new treatments.

1hgdrhq,AsianBeauty,The development of new PDRN products is insane,"So, I originally got on to the hype of PDRN because of the Rejuran injections that went viral, went to korea and got 2 ccs and also got the rejuran face masks in May, since most of the hype was surrounding the injections rather than the products you can buy and I didn’t see any reviews about the rejuran products itself. 

I then see hype surrounding 2 new PDRN products VT and pink serum with the brand that’s banned on this subreddit. I then decide on just going with rejuran in September because their formula is patented and it’s the OG and mainly because there wasn’t that much reviews; I actually made a few posts on here about it and it didn’t gain much traction. 

Fast forward to now there’s like idk 5 new ones and maybe more (correct me if I’m wrong) and loads of reviews and hype around one specifically (don’t know if that brand is also banned on this subreddit) and for me this post is more so about how insanely quick Korea is with launching and developing products like I knew it was quick but my god this is insane how quick it has been or maybe there is something I’m missing.

I only use the VT100 and Rejuran at night time, plus VT100 with retinol once a week. 

VT 100- I don’t really have a sensitive skin so I don’t feel much when use the VT 100. It’s a tingling sensation but it wasn’t bad on my skin. I added retinol to my routine after only using VT for one week.


Rejuran ampoule- I think this really helps with my texture and fine line. And I can tell even my pores are less visible. You can tell even my redness went away. I would love to continue use this one but the price mark is a bit high. Will be looking for any not plant based PDRn.

1hc2ed8,KoreanBeauty,My Experience with Rejuran HB+,"I have a good friend who traveled to Seoul in the spring and got Rejuran Healer. She vowed never to do it again because of the pain (!!!)

I was planning a trip to Seoul in October and started doing research into Rejuran. I wanted to know if there was any way to make it less painful. I discovered Rejuran HB+ which had lidocaine in it and I was sold! I have gotten Botox and Juvederm so I'm familiar with needles. I believe Rejuran HB+ was almost twice the price as Rejuran Healer because of the lidocaine.

Fast forward to October and my friend and I got a consult from the clinic. The doctor recommended I get Ulthera for my jawline and double chin and Rejuran HB+ for full face which was 4cc. He also asked if I wanted it for my crows feet but my friend said that it's more painful and doesn't really work so I declined.

I was nervous because I've gotten Ulthera before for my face and it was really painful. 

However, I put on my big girl pants and was prepared to white knuckle it.

They put on topical lidocaine for 15-20 minutes and I got Ulthera first. It was painful and I was squeezing the stress ball a lot. 

I was prepared to squeeze the ball for Rejuran HB+ and to my surprise, it didn't hurt! I think the doc did about 90 injections into my face. It only hurt a tiny bit near the end when the lidocaine starting wearing off near my cheeks.

After that they gave me a cooling mask for a few minutes and that was it. 

I looked like the hellraiser without the nails. My face was slightly pink but no pain at all, just bumps all over. I asked for a face mask and one of the assistants says it's actually a flex to walk around with my face looking like that. I smiled and asked for a face mask. My friend brought Avene Cicalfate Cream to Korea and both of us slathered that on for 3 days and the bumps disappeared.

It's been about 6 weeks since I had it done and I've noticed that my skin is smoother and not as dry, which I love. My jawline also looks lifted which is great.

I'm now planning on going back in May and October to get the Rejuran for my eyes and see how that turns out.",2024-12-11 19:55:51+00:00,34,11

1hatef2,KoreanBeauty,What skincare products should I ask my bf to get for me while he's in Korea?,"Sorry for the long post. My boyfriend just flew over to South Korea to visit a friend and I wanted him to get me some of the facial skincare products there. I tend to have oily skin, but I currently use a generic daily acne control cleanser with 10% Benzoyl Peroxide (this has worked the best out of all of the products I've previously used to prevent visible acne), a Korean collagen cleansing foam from Esfolio, a generic daily facial lotion moisturizer, and for days where I spend more time outside than in I use the Japanese Biore' UV AQUA Rich suncream (I wasn't able to find any good Korean suncreams where I live but it's supposedly really good too and I've loved it so far). I had also used the Joseon Glow Deep Serum Rice + Alpha-Arbutin for hyperpigmentation issues and uneven skin complexion, but whenever I used it, I would break out with acne. I don't understand why, because I thought I was using it correctly, but because of that I've stopped using it. I also occasionally use various Korean facial masks.

I feel that black heads and my uneven complexion are my biggest issues. But I have a hard time navigating through the skincare world, all of the products, what kind of stuff I should be using and when I should be using them. I'm a 36 year old white woman and have lighter toned skin that is slightly more transparent than most people. I tan fine to a point I guess, but for the last few years, I've been trying to be much more mindful of the sun's effects on my skin, especially since my facial skin complexion began to become uneven and darken on various areas on my face. I also live in Utah, USA, which is in a dry desert area of the US at a high elevation (approximately 1288 meters above sea level).

His friend is going to take him to Olive Young, and I've been looking through their website, but I'm unsure of what to get. I've picked out a few things that seem like they would be good but I'm not sure. They are:

1h9erg1,koreanskincare,Rejuran OR juvelook,"Hi peeps,

I really want to do a skin treatment while i’m here in Korea and i see both good stories about Juvelook and Rejuran. I’m really torn between the two of these and i can’t find topics here on reddit that compares the two treatments. I was wonder if anyone over here has done both treatments and has a favourite or has seen better results with one above the other. I would love to hear your stories.
Yes i do know that they are both two different products and the one is more for hydration and the other more for collagen restoration.
I’ve done my research on both of them and based on my skin i can go for both, but i really want to hear your experiences and comparisons. So i can make. Better decision.

1h91uxm,DIYCosmeticProcedures,Cautionary tale and vent: just wasted two expensive PN syringes trying to mix them 😭,"Hundreds of dollars exploding in my face and not in a good way. Was trying to mix Rejuran and Lilied K using a connector and somehow there was pressure buildup that popped off the connector and the entire contents shot out. Don’t be like me. Take your time using one of these. It was my first time trying a syringe mixer and this was probably a typical noob mistake. Ugh. If anyone’s curious, I was trying to mix them to take advantage of the best of both - Rejuran blebs absorb faster, Lilied K has lido and is inexpensive. I’ve mixed them before but used a sterile vile which caused a lot of bubbles. This way was working great until the explosion happened. ",2024-12-07 20:47:23+00:00,14,6

**treatments i'm considering** \- pico lasers, slyfirm microneedling, fat dissolving injections, and botox. i considered rejuran, but have pretty low pain tolerance. Ultherapy is also something I've thought about, but heard slyfirm microneedling might be more beneficial.   
  
**my concerns**: pigmentation, sunspots, forehead crinkles, and drooping face  
  
please tell me what your thoughts are about any of the treatments i listed or anything that I haven't considered, super appreciate your opinions! Would also love clinic recommendations. I've heard so many people say the places on tiktok/IG are all paid reviews, so wanted to come on reddit for *real* reviews hehe. thank you!",2024-12-03 16:21:41+00:00,4,7

Are there any products that I could meso that would heal in two weeks and would also have some noticeable results the first time? From what I have read, most skin boosters take multiple treatments to see results and typically not within the first two weeks. Noticeable results to me would be more hydrated/plump skin or something to make my eyes look more youthful. I'm 35 so my eyes aren't too too bad but my under eye area is getting more crepe and is bothering me. I'm probably cutting it too close by the time I order a product, but please do share if you have anything in mind. I do get injectables but I really want to focus on my skin.

In the meantime, I plan to meso Rejuran Healer (face) and Rejuran I (under eye) every four weeks for four months. Two weeks after each meso treatment, I plan to use a TCA peel. If my Derminator arrives during this time, I will swap out MNing for the peel (using Curenex, followed by Plated intense).

After this series, I plan to wait a month and then meso Gouri every four weeks for the next three months. I know that PCL is controversial, but I have tolerated it before. I will allergy test before each treatment and aspirate before each injection.

1h0e3nt,KoreanBeauty,VandS Clinic and FINE Clinic Review,"I want to preface this by stating before I had any treatments done in Korea, I consulted my dermatologist beforehand to make sure that anything I done in Korea wouldn't affect my health as I had a few underlying chronic diseases - one of them skin-related. Other than telling me not to get any fillers or peels, I was told everything else was ok. I felt better to have consulted her as she is one of the best dermatologists in my area and is also Korean-American and knows the skincare industry in Korea very well.

I had gone to VandS clinic in Myeongdong in early April, 2024 and had a bunch of treatments done. The clinic was definitely geared toward foreigners and it was a factory clinic. I waited 25 minutes after my appointment time before I was asked to wash my face. Then I waited 30 minutes to meet with an English speaking consultant and I felt very pressured and wasn't sure what she was recommending was what I needed. I was not offered the option for a skin analysis. I paid for rejuran and immode (mistake because you need several sessions), pico (again you need several sessions), and mole and whitehead removal (the consultant circled the whiteheads but the doctor couldn't find them and missed half). I was told to go out to the waiting room to wait for my treatments. The waiting room was overflowing so there weren't any seats and it felt rushed. Thankfully, I understand Korean so I knew what was being said to me. Once my face was covered with numbing cream, I waited for about 20 minutes. The doctors spoke almost no English and only came in to do the treatments and left. I had a different doctor for each treatment. There was almost no privacy. Just a curtain between beds. After the treatments, a person came in to remove the numbing cream and give me a mask. She then sent me upstairs to change and check out. It was not what I had expected and I should have done more research prior to going to just any skin clinic.

I went to FINE Clinic on 11/8/24 in the afternoon. While the waiting room was full, it wasn’t overflowing as it was when I went to VandS clinic in Myeongdong. My appointment started within 10 minutes of arrival. I was asked to remove all makeup and wash my face. I splurged for the skin analysis (50K won). Then waited for a few minutes for my consultation.

My consultation was with Dr. Choi and I spent a good 20 minutes with him. He started off the consult by telling me what the skin analysis meant and by asking what my goals were for my skin. I told him I wanted to tighten up the crepey skin on my neck. I wanted to lift the lines that had deepened around my chin and from my nose and lips and tighten my jaw line. He asked me if I wanted to address the redness on my face and I told him I didn’t as I have rosacea and I have flares with allergic reactions and the rosacea would only return. We went over my health conditions (of which he had knowledge). He recommended Thermage FLX for my lower face to lift and tighten the lines around my mouth and jawline. He also recommended Oglio for my neck. Thermage usually comes in 300, 600, and 900 doses. He recommended 300 initially but after we discussed the depth of the lines, he said 400 would be the maximum he would recommend. He recommended these particular treatments since I was looking for long-term results and wouldn't be back in Korea until at least June, 2025. He did discuss the fact that at some point the lifting procedures wouldn't work for me as well since I had very little face fat and my skin was very thin and at 54, it was losing elasticity. I was aware of all these things since my US dermatologist had said the same thing. There was no upselling at all. He did tell me that he hoped he would be the one doing the procedures but another doctor may do it based on what was going on at the time.

Dr. Choi did the Oglio on my neck. Then Dr. Kim (I think he is the director) came and did the Thermage. I won’t lie. It was painful but I have a high tolerance for pain.

After the treatments were complete, a woman came in to put a cooling sheet mask on me for 5 minutes. After that was done, she lightly massaged my face and neck with moisturizer and I was done.

I got after-treatment instructions at checkout. I was told during my consult it would take at least a month, if not longer to start seeing results so my expectations were tempered. I'm less than a month out but I am beginning to see improvements.

I very much preferred my experience at FINE Clinic over VandS. I didn’t feel rushed and certainly felt I had all the information I needed before the treatments began. Also, the fact that both doctors spoke excellent English helped enormously.",2024-11-26 15:12:07+00:00,12,4

1gyjqu4,Skincare_Addiction,"I tried Pro-Yellow Lasers and rejuran undereye healer, and I think I wasted my money","I (25, F) would say that prior to all of this, my skin was in pretty good condition. I have no bad skin condition, but I did have the problem of dull and uneven skin (which I would say is natural as I age). I saw how an influencer I had been following closely used Pro-Yellow Laser to treat her skin- her skin was always glassy and glowy, and I really wanted it. So, I booked this 6 treatment package thing at a medispa (and it cost roughly around more than 1000 usd :().

Honestly, I see zero to no difference in my skin tone. I think my skin has gotten drier and even more lacklustre after I did the treatment. (Also, to be noted I am on tretinoin, so all of this AND tretinoin might have dried out my skin even more, I did inform the doctor who was performing laser treatment on me this, and she said it was OK). Worst of all, I feel like I have aged even more after all of this, like my skin has loss its plumpness and volume? 

I also used rejuran under my eyes, and this one really cost a bomb (1500 usd maybe, for 3 treatments). Nothing changed. Still the same heavy and dark undereyes :(.

1gw7q93,KoreanBeauty,"Shinebeam vs. VS Line Clinic in Seoul, South Korea","\*Posted in Korea Travel as well. Newbie and not sure where this post belongs!

I recently spent time in Seoul, and obviously had to test out their famous skincare clinics. I spent hours on Reddit, Google Reviews, and social media prior to the trip trying to determine which skincare clinics would provide the best value and quality. Posting here in the hopes that it can help other folks making similar decisions.

For reference, I am from North America, female, in my 30's. Main skincare issues were blackheads, some hormonal acne, sun damage, and preventative aging. I am not a stranger to medical clinics, and have been receiving facials, botox, microneedling, IPL, etc. for years.

I booked the same experiences for both myself and my partner (male): a request for a full skin analysis with a doctor, and then any recommended treatments to follow. I decided on the following clinics (experiences spaced two weeks apart):

* Shinebeam Gangnam - wanted to test a notorious ""factory"" but cheap clinic
* VS Line Clinic Apgujeong - wanted to test a more ""upscale"" and pricier clinic

Shinebeam Experience:

Pros:

* Thorough skin analysis. Used the Mark View as well as a hydration check. They were able to tell me (with data) that my skin was oily on the surface but dry underneath (hormones), which shockingly nobody was able to tell me in North America. She also told me to avoid IPL due to mild melasma, and recommended pico laser instead if I wanted treatment for sun damage. Again, nobody had ever mentioned this in North America. There was a charge for this analysis, approximately $80. Worth it!
* Surprisingly zero upsell. I was prepared for hours of treatments and pages of recommendations, but the consultant was incredibly non-pushy and sweet. She recommended a facial and pore treatment for my partner, and a pumpkin peel for myself. I was frankly begging her to add on more treatments. Ended up adding on a pico laser treatment for myself even though she did not push it. She stated that ""we had great skin"" and didn't need much. This was debatable, but the non-pushy consult was refreshing and respected.
* Great prices. All the recommended treatments were under $100 each, and I believe our totals (including skin analysis charge) came to around $200-$300 each. For reference, Pico laser in North America is $400-$650 a session, and it was around $80 at Shinebeam.
* Thorough skincare regime recommendations. Our consultant spent around 30-40 minutes with my partner and I and gave a ton of great advice. She recommended a specific ingredient for sun damage, advised both of us to use ampules and serums rather than heavy creams, cleansing oil to remove blackheads, collagen masks for hydration without acne concerns, and a strong SPF with PA+++.
* Great follow up via Kakao Talk. An English speaking consultant followed up with us and recommended specific products from Olive Young for each of us. This was incredibly helpful when navigating the endless aisles of this store.

Cons:

* Long waits. My partner and I arrived 15 minutes early for our 2:30 PM appointments, but were not seen for a consult or analysis until nearly 4 PM. To be fair, the receptionist came and apologized profusely and gave us some free sunscreens/masks.
* Treatments were a mystery and our consultants did not speak English well. We were separated and led to different rooms/beds after sitting in a (different) waiting room for 10 minutes. In the first room (for my Pico laser), a doctor came into and completed my treatment in less than 5 minutes. He was able to chat in English and explain what he was doing. However, the next treatment was done at a bed by a girl who did not speak English very well at all. My pumpkin peel seemed relatively ""fool proof"" but to be honest it was a bit traumatizing as I was laying on a bed having things put on my face with no idea of the purpose or length. For example, they put on a molding mask (which means you can't see and everything is covered except your nostrils) and just left me for 15 minutes. I was panicking not knowing what was on my face, how long it would be on me, and if they had forgotten me. She came back and started putting a light device on my skin. I spoke up this time and asked how long this would stay on. She said 5 minutes then left. This felt like way longer than five minutes, and there was no explanation of how far along in the process we were or what was happening. My partner had a similar experience. I can only imagine the trauma if you are getting injections or a more invasive procedure without any explanation or expectations, or ability to ask questions.
* Lack of privacy. The beds are laid out in a distinctly factory setting, and there are short wall barriers (around 6 feet high) but not curtains separating patients. Everyone is very close together. There was a girl getting Rejuran injected four beds down from me and one bed over from my partner, and he heard every wail that she was making. We could both see her hands grasping at anything she could reach during her injections, and she did not stop crying loudly for 20 minutes as she was injected. My partner was so traumatized that he immediately removed one of his treatments and got a refund as he was not ""feeling it"" so to speak after witnessing this.

Overall Ranking: 3.75/5. Would return again for pico laser and minimally invasive procedures given how cheap it was.

VS Line Clinic Experience:

Pros:

* Timing. We were seen within 10 minutes of our appointment time, minimal waiting.
* Professional facilities that felt much more private. There were curtains and walls between patient treatment areas and I did not hear other patients at all during my treatment. I was taken to a separate room for my Botox treatment that had an actual door for privacy.
* Quality of treatments was excellent. The two treatments that I did do were both very well done. The facial was thorough and she spent some serious time on extractions, WAY better than anything I've had in North America. The botox injection was super natural, and among my favourite botox treatment I've ever had. The doctor also injected something into some active pimples I had, which apparently is very common over there and included in my facial? Whatever it was, it got rid of some painful, under the skin zits pretty much overnight.
* English was better spoken and time taken to explain treatments. The girl doing the facial had moderate English skills, and would murmur brief explanations of what she was doing on my face. At one point, she busted out a needle and I asked ""what is this for,"" to which she had to call a translator over who was able to explain it was for popping pimples. The doctor also spoke good English, and we had a brief conversation.

Cons:

* They wanted to keep my passport during my treatment. They pitched this as a ""we will have your tax free process done when you are finished treatment"" but my partner and I were super sketched about them keeping our passports behind a counter for an hour. We both put our things in a locker then decided we wanted them back. They made a bit of a fuss over this but when we got VERY firm they returned them. Seemed a bit odd.
* Skincare Analysis fail. The ""skincare analysis with doctor"" that I had requested turned out to be two girls behind a counter, one of whom visually inspected my skin (from three feet away) and spoke in Korean to the other girl (the translator?) who relayed to us what she thought we should have done. There was no data used to provide proof points of why they suggested certain treatments, and I'm 99% sure that neither of them were ""doctors."" To be fair, the analysis was free, but they also did not spend any time on skincare or recommended products.
* HUGE upsell with no data behind it. I had looked at their list of treatments offered on their website ahead of time, and they essentially tried to pitch me half of those treatments. They told me I need: Botox, skin tightening (Ulthera, Thermage, or Oligo), Potenza with exosomes, under eye filler, Rejuran stamped into my skin, and a facial. My partner decided to test them after watching what they recommended me and said that ""his skin was great and he didn't think he needed anything, what would they recommend?"" The girls immediately were flustered and said that he could pick whatever he wanted. He settled on their most basic facial. I decided on a facial, tightening, and botox, but felt very pressured. I came out of the consult room in a daze then decided I didn't actually want the tightening. I went back in the room to tell the consultant, who immediately made it awkward by asking ""why don't you want this""? I stayed firm and she ended up removing it from my bill.
* Pricing. The treatments were double the price of Shinebeam ($130 for facial vs. $60). The other treatments were also pricey compared to other Korean clinics. For example, Oligo started at 160,000KRW at Shinebeam, and 660,000KRW at VS Line. Overall, they recommended approximately $3000 worth of treatments to me.
* Doctors are not well briefed on what they are providing. The girl who did my facial led me over to a private room for my Botox, but the doctor seemed confused on what the plan was. He picked up the Botox syringe and the girl instantly spoke in Korean to him and he then put down the syringe and said that he was going to do a laser on me that was included in my facial. He then picked up the Botox syringe again, and the girl snapped something else in Korean. He then put the syringe down and said that he was going to do an injection of my pimples to reduce inflammation. After this was done, the girl finally allowed him to do the Botox. Without her there to guide him, who knows what would have happened.

Overall Ranking: 3.75/5. The pricing and upsell was insane, but the quality of the treatments left me wanting more. If I was going back for invasive treatments, would probably give this place another shot.",2024-11-21 04:18:27+00:00,8,1

He then put the syringe down and said that he was going to do an injection of my pimples to reduce inflammation. After this was done, the girl finally allowed him to do the Botox. Without her there to guide him, who knows what would have happened.

1gsiyke,DIYCosmeticProcedures,spot treatments for active acne — any recommendations?,"my skin is really very clear and looks great — EXCEPT for occasional hormonal acne on my chin, jawline, and neck. (usually around my period, ugh…). i have the usual topical stuff down: i have a curology subscription and use the prescription cream a few times a week, and usually treat spots with topical sulfur, benzoyl peroxide, and hydrocolloid acne patches.

i’m wondering if any skin boosters or other treatments would be effective to meso and zap spots for this purpose? the goal would be to help them clear more quickly and reduce PIH. my jaw and neck in particular tend to be more likely to leave PIH than other parts of my face. (i would likely treat the areas immediately next to the spots, probably not a great idea to directly inject active spots.)

on hand, i have:

 - a few boxes of rejuran s, which i bought primarily to try out on my stretch marks + using a little on stubborn PIH on my face, but would be willing to sacrifice a few blebs for this
- rejuran i, which i plan to use for all over my face
- caratfill aurora
- revitalex pdrn
- selastin exo (probably not ideal for this, since it has to be reconstituted immediately before use)

1gr0fq6,KoreanBeauty,Availed of Rejuran H via multi needle injector...did not experience the bumps/bumpy face...does this mean it wasn't effectively injected?,"This was my first time to have Rejuran. I chose Rejuran H because the description seemed to address my skin concerns. After reading a lot of feedback regarding the injections, I decided to avail of the ""needle gun"" or the multi needle injector machine, because I had low pain tolerance. My dermatologist also called the machine ""Hycoox"" and I did see that brand name printed on the machine when they used it on me. 
Numbing cream was applied on my face and left there for 40mins. The ""needle gun"" procedure was not completely painless, I would rate the pain as 3/10. I was initially happy about the whole experience, since I was trying to avoid the painful individual injections, but when I looked at the mirror immediately afterwards, I saw that my face was just wet with the Rejuran liquid (?) and there were no ""iconic"" Rejuran bumps at all. I also observed that there were several (less that 10) tiny pinpricks of blood but none of the bumps I kept seeing (from YouTube, Tiktok, IG reels) on patients who were fresh from their Rejuran procedure. 

I am now starting to think of 2 scenarios:
1) Maybe Rejuran was not used on me because I was not shown the actual syringe being inserted into the needle gun/multi injector machine? I was laying down and had my eyes closed when the dermatologist entered my room and started the procedure. Looking back, I should have watched or observe the preparation.

2) Maybe the needle gun/multi injector machine/Hycoox did not penetrate my skin correctly or deeply? But I did not raise my concern at that moment because I did see the tiny pinpricks of blood (mostly on my forehead) and I took that as a sign that the procedure was successful. 

To those whom have had Rejuran, just wanted to know if those bumps really do appear automatically afterwards or it is possible that certain patients do not experience a bumpy face? ",2024-11-14 08:36:34+00:00,2,3

**Background**: I’m 40 and have always had great skin, but the past 1.5 years have been tough with family losses and other challenges. In August, I was diagnosed with breast cancer, and the stress, pain, meds, and weight loss have left my skin dry, sensitive, red, dull, and sagging. I also had Fraxel right before my diagnosis, and my skin hasn’t fully recovered—I now have melasma and broken capillaries and want something to help it heal from all this trauma.

So far, I’ve used Curenex and Hyaron (meso), micro-stamped with Selatox, and recently got Gouri.

- PRP PRF etc
- PLLA PDLLA products etc

I'm planning to continue with the recommended 3-4 initial treatments spaced 3-4 weeks apart, then maintain 1-2 treatments yearly.

While researching, I found Rejuran True Skin Essence, the Chinese version of Rejuran Healer, which seems similar. Has anyone tried both and noticed any difference? Is the original South Korean Rejuran Healer superior, or are they essentially the same?

I saw a post here from a few months ago where some considered the Chinese version inferior—any firsthand comparisons?

Another thing I noticed: the original Rejuran Healer comes with 34g needles, while True Skin Essence doesn’t. 

Also, I’m curious about Rejuran HB, which includes 1% PN with added HA, compared to the 2% PN in Rejuran Healer. Has anyone observed a difference between Rejuran HB and Rejuran Healer/True Skin Essence with the lower PN but added HA?",2024-11-08 17:16:05+00:00,6,7

1gh2g6x,koreatravel,"Koreanclinic, cellinclinic hongdae my experience","I’m a flight attendant, and a Korean flight attendant once recommended I visit Celline Clinic in Hongdae. So, in total, three of us went together, and the Korean attendant plans to visit too after seeing my results!

First, we had a consultation with a skin specialist, followed by an appointment with the doctor. Communication was smooth since everyone was fluent in English. I actually learned a lot about my skin that I hadn’t known before. They have those machine thingi that analyze your skin in detail.

One thing I really liked about this place was that it didn’t feel overly pushy. In every country and any place I go, sometimes it feels like they try to sell you extra treatments, extra stuff which isn’t always necessary. I guess locals sometimes expect foreigners to be rich which im far away from rich lol. For example, my friend wanted more lip filler, but the doctor advised against it, which was interesting

They recommended Ulthera + Onda lifting for me (never heard of Onda before, heard it’s from Italy. I may be wrong). They told me that they will customize to match my face’s unique needs since each area has different skin levels and fat distribution.

Honestly, I was lost in the first 15 minutes of explanation lol, but I decided to trust them based on how professional they seemed. I told them I wanted to work on my eye bags and laugh lines, and they recommended lifting and a collagen treatment called Juvelook.

I also wanted a bit of lip filler since my friend said it’s popular. I probably annoyed the doctor by insisting it look natural at least 100 times, haha.

The process was mostly smooth, but the anesthesia took forever. I was a little irritated, especially since I was on my period. When I asked, the staff explained that Rejuran requires extra time for anesthesia since the injections can be painful. Even afterward, it was still a bit painful, but I love the results! I look about 5-6 years younger—no joke! It would of been better If reddit allow us to post pics and do words tgt but prob that will make it too big for a post anyways,

If I get the chance to visit Korea again, I’d definitely come back. I wrote this as part of my journey of exploring Korea. Afterward, my friends and I went to Lotte World. Go, Girl’s Day! :)

I have been looking to get a skin booster such as Rejuran and a treatment such as Ulthera however finding a clinic that can do so is proving difficult.

The reason is not because there is a shortage of clinics offering this treatment, but the information surround the clinics is shockingly untrustworthy!

Most, if not every clinic I see on google maps, has multiple reviews that state the clinic offers freebies in exchange for 5 star reviews, and you do indeed see the ratio of good to bad reviews is suspiciously unbalanced.

Not only that but I’ve seen people on Reddit making posts to either criticise or ask for information, only to be met with posts either promoting or defending clinics, from accounts made specifically to make that comment.

I used to work in digital marketing, I know it’s useful to do some forum and social media posts but it just seems to be very fake and filled with misinformation with this industry.

1g037d9,koreatravel,"Seoul Clinic Review: Yonseiro, Ppeum, FINE, Egg","I spent 2.5 months in Korea and got a few dermatology treatments done. Since Reddit was an important resource when doing my research, I want to give back by recounting my experiences.  
My experiences were mostly influenced by: price incl. transparency, responsiveness, English skills, consultation.

Overall, I, like many others, have noticed that for many clinics on a similar level, there isn't really a less or more expensive clinic. One clinic might have cheap Botox but expensive Rejuran. The clinic next to it might have it the other way round. Thus, it is important ot have an idea of what you want, search in advance, and not be afraid to shop around. In Korea, you get a consultation and treatment done in the same appointment - but you can still demand only a consultation. It might just end up costing you a little bit, then (like 30-70k KRW, depending on the clinic). Also, definitely utilise Kakao to contact them and ask for current events.

Yonseiro

* found via: small Tiktok influencer
* location: Jung-gu, between Jong-gak station and Gyeongbokgung Palace
* notable
   * generic name - I accidentally contacted another clinic with a similar name first and was confused
   * clinic less polished compared to the others, a little shabby looking in some places
   * on my first visit, I only wanted a consultation - they were massively confused about that
   * I have been there twice, and spoiler: I liked it the most
* responsiveness: really good on Kakao, flexible and accommodating
* English skills:
   * 1st time: not so good, spoke to consultant, had to use Google a lot, but made it work. Attending physician (middle aged) also did not speak English well.
   * 2nd time: Attending physician (young) spoke English pretty well.
* Consultation:
   * 1st time only with a sales consultant who may have had some knowledge but obviously not enough of it (let alone a medical degree) to provide a thorough assessment or highly individualised recommendations.
   * 2nd time with the physician who also just agreed to what I said - I had come after my consultation with FINE, so I really already had recommendations
   * not once did I feel pressured to buy something I didn't want.
* treatments done with prices incl. tax (which you can get back at the airport)
   * prices were transparent and available on their website and did not differ for foreigners
   * goal: overall skin improvement, long-term maintenance
   * 1st time - total 754 KRW
      * CO2 GV Spot to remove a small mole, 10k KRW
      * Botox (Coretox) around the lip corners to hopefully help with the downward smile (did not help), 77k KRW
      * Botox (Coretox) in my underarms for no/less sweat (helped greatly), 179k KRW
      * Lhala Peel, 89k KRW
      * 4cc Rejuran Healer in a package, including CRYO and LDM therapy afterwards to help the skin calm down and regenerate, 399k KRW. 4cc Rejuran only would've been 360k KRW.
   * 2nd time - total 600k KRW
      * Oligio 600 shots to hopefully help with an even skin tone but would actually need more than one treatment, 600k KRW

Ppeum

* found via: it's kinda everywhere, unsure
* location: Myeongdong (where I went, they have more)
* notable
   * really cute interior
   * factory-like, yes, but that also means the processes are clear and easy
* responsiveness: really good on Kakao
* English skills: consultant and reception staff spoke English well. Cosmetologists did not speak English but we didn't really speak at all to begin with.
* consultancy: the consultant suggested me treatments that were over budget by a little bit. And I already did not want to look cheap and named a higher budget than I actually wanted for Ppeum, but that's on me.
* treatments done with prices incl. tax (which you can get back at the airport)
   * prices were transparent and available on their website and did not differ for foreigners
   * goal: quick lunchbreak fix to freshen up before a photo shooting the next day
   * total \~110k KRW
      * some facial, I'm not sure anymore, might have been the Waterglow Peel inkl. light therapy, 80k KRW
      * Cinderella Injection, 30k

FINE

* found via: their own Tiktok
* location: Gangnam, by Sinsa station
* notable
   * nice interior
   * looks and feels like a clinic run by young physicians geared towards foreigners for quick profit which I don't necessarily think is a bad thing
   * I only wanted a consultation - no problem
* responsiveness: ...they will answer questions, but not actively drive the chat to bring you in as a customer. Made me feel like they did me a favour instead of me being a prospective customer.
* English skills: consulting physician spoke English very well.
* Consultation: The physician consulted me and took the time I needed - there was no rush. I did come with specific concerns that were not in his knowledge base When he could not help, he started talking about redness in my cheeks - which I did and do not care about at all and had not mentioned as a concern. Needed to be re-directed back to my concerns. But in the end, he provided me with some reasonable sounding recommendations.
* treatments done with prices incl. tax (which you can get back at the airport)
   * prices transparent on website and do not differ for foreigners
   * no treatments done because I got annoyed by their customer service on Kakao
   * however, I did spontaneously book a facial analysis for...70k KRW maybe? Waste of money. Report lacks nuance and is useless for everything except laughing at it with friends (and its design is plain ugly).
   * after consultation, compared prices of treatments I wanted done between FINE, Egg and Yonseiro. FINE was horribly overpriced compared to the other two for Rejuran.

Egg

* found via: Google
* location: Gangnam, by Sinsa station
* notable
   * separate translator from consultant
   * the translator stayed with me for a bit longer after the consultancy had finished to guide me through the process
   * attending physician was very matter-of-fact. Like with the 1st time in Yonseiro, she flew in, did the treatment and was gone as quickly as possible.
   * I felt more in a factory here than in Ppeum - in the first room (which I only left for the treatments the physician administered instead of a nurse/cosmetologist) there was no privacy, it was cramped and doubled as a storage room. Different classical music played from two different sides. People were walking past - staff and clients. It was cold. Overall unpleasant
* responsiveness: really good on Kakao
* English skills: none for the consultant and nurses, but the translater spoke fluent English, and so did the attending physician
* Consultation: Done by a consultant only, but I felt like they were quite knowledgable, and them being able to speak in Korean instead of struggling with English because we had the translator certainly helped.
* treatments done
   * prices transparent on website and did not differ for foreigners
   * total 795k KRW
      * Botox (Xeomin) between my brows, 45k KRW (so cheap, Xeomin was even more expensive than Coretox at Yonseiro, would've been maybe 119k KRW)
      * 4cc Rejuran Healer & 2cc Rejuran Eye, normal price 500k KRW & 400k KRW but they had a seasonal event going on so I ended up paying 750k KRW and got laughing gas on top (which made getting Rejuran bearable)

It's long, but I hope some people might find it helpful! ",2024-10-09 21:51:38+00:00,63,18

1ftpe66,DIYCosmeticProcedures,Rejuran Trueskin Essence and Lilied K experience,"Last night I did my second round PN 2% treatment for my face and first round for my neck.  You can find my post on the first treatment 19 days ago titled “Rejuran Healer Experience” with pics. 

This time I used Rejuran Trueskin Essence and Lilied K. The Trueskin and Lilied K don’t come with needles but fortunately I had great needles left over from the Healer.  

I numbed a lot less this time thinking I can handle it. Big mistake. It hurts way more. Do not recommend. It’s doable but ouchie!!! Next time I will numb 30 to an hour. Much more comfortable. 

This time I treated face and neck. Used Lilied K on neck. Neck was comfortable - I’m guessing due to a combination of numbing my neck longer AND Lilied K having lido. 

The pain with the Rejuran was two fold - upon piercing the skin and upon pushing the product. When I numbed longer last time at least I didn’t feel the piercing step which made it go faster. 

On this second round for my face (first round for my neck) my blebs are *almost* all absorbed on the face the following morning whereas the last time they were still very much visible. My neck blebs are all fully there. Even immediately after the Rejuran blebs seemed to flatten after an hour whereas Lilied K were very prominent. The following morning my neck is still very bumpy. 
I am not sure if it’s because Lilied K doesn’t absorb as fast/more viscous or because it’s my first round for my neck. We’ll see after my second round of Lilied K on my neck but if it’s because it doesn’t absorb as fast I won’t be able to ever have the social downtime to use Lilied K on my face.

1fk4e1c,DIYCosmeticProcedures,Is PN worth it if skin “quality” is good?,"I’ve been eyeing PN like Rejuran Healer or Lilied K during the current sales going on.

But I’m wondering if it’s going to do anything for my use case scenario since my skin “quality” itself is pretty good. I don’t have any static wrinkles after using Tox, my issues are really due to volume loss and structural type issues.

I have a lot of volume loss in my temples and cheeks and fat pad loss/slipping. I have really bad nasolabial folds and malar bags under my eyes as well as a line in my mid cheek due to the fat pads slipping. My skin “laxity” is good, it’s really more of a structural type thing imo

Would PN do anything for that type of thing? I’ve read up on it extensively and it seems like people either report magical results or say it didn’t do anything. 

Even Lilied K which is the cheaper version of Rejuran Healer is still pretty pricy, so I didn’t know if it would be a waste trying to fix stuff that isn’t really suited for PN",2024-09-18 21:38:00+00:00,3,13

UNNI has a system called Excellent Hospital for Customer Evaluations. It basically means its ""verified"" in the American sense.  
*Just because something isn't UNNI verified doesn't mean it's not reputable, but for foreigners like us it can be helpful when doing our due diligence before visiting another country for our cosmetic procedures.*

You can look at all of the verified clinics [here.](https://www.gangnamunni.com/info/certificate) Many companies are spelled differently here as it is the phonetic translation of Hangul to English (ex: G.U. Clinic is spelled JiYu in Hangul ) The ‘Excellent Hospital for Customer Evaluations’ status **is updated every month.**

1. **Price Information**:
   * **Consistency**: The price and volume of services should match what is displayed in the app when you visit the clinic.
   * **Example**: If the app shows a treatment costs $100, the clinic should not charge more or less than this amount.
2. **Waiting Time**:
   * **Short Waiting Time**: The clinic should have a high satisfaction rate regarding the waiting time.
   * **Example**: Patients should not have to wait excessively long for their appointments.
3. **No Forced Purchases**:
   * **No Pressure**: Clinics should not pressure patients into purchasing additional treatments beyond what they initially signed up for.
   * **Example**: If you go for a specific treatment, the clinic should not push you to buy other services.
4. **No Forced Reviews**:
   * **Voluntary Feedback**: Clinics should not force patients to write reviews or take photos if they do not want to.
   * **Example**: You should feel comfortable declining to write a review or take a photo after your treatment.
5. **Safe Environment**:
   * **Secure Facilities**: Clinics should have a safe environment, including measures like CCTV and verified doctors.
   * **Example**: The clinic should have security cameras and ensure that all doctors are properly credentialed.",2024-09-14 22:29:12+00:00,186,39
1fgrfxc,DIYCosmeticProcedures,Rejuran healer experience ,"Hi all - I did Rejuran healer the other day. Numbed for 30 mins. Used both syringes. It didn’t hurt as much as I expected. The included needles are so sharp which made it very easy. Not all injections hurt, only some of them. The bumps lingered longer than I hoped. For about 48 hours. Pics in comments on day 1-4 progression. I will def repeat the treatment. It’s hard to show in pictures but I see an overall “suppleness”improvement in my skin that’s different from hyaron for example.

1fewmbc,koreatravel,Lienjang experience ,"I recently visited Lienjang clinic in Hongdae.
Despite its recent popularity on social media, my experience was far from what I expected. 
One of the procedure that i came in for was Rejuran skin booster. I was very familiar with the treatment since it was my 4th time doing it.
However after wearing the numbing cream less than 10 minutes the nurse told me to clean it and wash my face. I asked her if it was not too early and she said “should be fine”.

During the procedure, I experienced excruciating pain, which was worsen by the fact that the anesthesia cream didn’t really succeed in numbing my skin ( being on my face for less than 10 minutes). This was far from adequate, and it was clear that my comfort was not a priority for them. 
The treatment I received was unprofessional, and I felt undervalued and disrespected. Not to mention that when the doctor entered the room he didn’t even acknowledge my presence or even said hello. Clearly it was a busy day with too many patients.

When I complained about the fact that the numbing cream didn’t really work and level of pain was nothing compared to the other the staff seemed indifferent to my concern and became very defensive and started to contradict me —-even though i showed them the time on the receipt and the time that i started the treatment.

It's disheartening to see a clinic gain fame while failing to uphold the standards that initially attracted so many people.

If you're considering a skin care procedure while in Korea, I suggest exploring other clinics. There are too many otheroptions available that prioritize quality care and respectful treatment.

Here’s your original comment which for some reason I cannot respond to:

*”I finally finished the whole two syringes (equals 4 ml) Rejuran Healer. Unfortunately my acne got back after not injecting Curenex for 3 weeks - it seems like I really need to use one vial of Curenex per month to remain the results. Do you think I can use a vial of Curenex together with Rejuran and will it have the same effects or is it better to spread the treatments. I'd like to do everything in one sitting just because of the downtime. On the other hand I don't want to ""waste"" this expensive stuff!”*

You can use a mixing tube and make a Curanex Rejuran cocktail and see if it works to keep your acne under control. I would do a 50/50 mix in a smaller separate syringe and only mix a small amount to do a test patch in an area. Otherwise if it doesn’t work you’re stuck with a large syringe of the cocktail. 

However, I’m also wondering if the Curanex by itself (since it’s more concentrated) is doing the job managing your acne? 

Otherwise I would spread the treatments by at least 2 weeks. 

I’m sure it’s frustrating waiting, but it would be interesting to see if the cocktail has a similar benefit.
If it does work you could up the ratio a bit since there’s 5ml of Curanex and 4 of Rejuran. ",2024-08-09 17:15:36+00:00,1,0
1ensjy7,DIYaesthetics,Possible mistake using Illuma PN for Under Eye Hollow/Crevice,"I believed Illuma Luna was targeted towards under eye over-pigmentation, which I don’t have. After stopping regular check-ins w my derm after a cross-country move three years ago, my right eye has slowly developed a sunken area in the tear trough, the left less pronounced. 

I begin the search for something with PN to strengthen/improve the skin, along with a MINIMALLY cross-linked HA to add volume in the safest way I could imagine. So I do the product I posted in title w 27 G needle at a 45 degree angle. Things on the right are starting rocky, with bruising, but I finish. I then do the left with no issues. Prior to this (maybe a month earlier), I used Juve Eyes and it turned out well enough, but of course isn’t going to directly treat hollowing. 

Fast forward two weeks, left side great. Right side is not. Increased swelling above the hollow remains - it’s not an improvement. I thought my lymph system would be more robust and clear it out more efficiently . And I’m not even sold that the hollow was well filled. 

Am feeling idiotic and hoping for some advice from our far from idiotic, smart, resourceful members. The swelling is close to my lower lid - no discoloration. Not sure how to manually drain lymph in this sensitive area. Can’t do Botox until this clears bc Botox inhibits the movement which “drains” post-HA swelling. 

Thoughts? One was to order some Rejuran I. I’m on a trip so the only stuff I have w me is my glutathione, Revs Pro 32, and Nabota. No ice roller, though I maybe need heat. I’m really not thrilled about Hydronilase (sp) bc I haven’t any experience with it. 

Pics would make this better. I just applied some self tan crap on my face so I can probably get a better eye pic after I wash off in AM. 

Thanks for listening and giving me a bit of hope (and knowledge) to mitigate this now aged-looking under eye. I appreciate any help and consideration. Thank you 😊

1e2p52p,AsianBeauty,Thoughts on PDRN as a topical skincare ingredient?,"PDRN (Polydeoxyribonucleotide) is the main ingredient used in Rejuran Healer Skin Booster injections.  [This study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2096691122000723), among others seems to indicate promising anti-ageing properties for PDRN.

Looking at the stated benefits, it seems to mimic the touted benefits of growth factors:

* Stimulates collagen and elastin production
* Speeds up tissue regeneration
* Repairs damage from within the deeper layers
* Diminishes dark spots and discoloration⁠
* Improves elasticity
* Brightens skin tone
* Strengthens skin barrier
* Refines pore size
* Has excellent biocompatibility with human skin
* Imparts a progressive and long-lasting effect on the skin

I had never heard of this ingredient until a couple of months ago, and now it looks like quite a few brands have come up with their own PDRN products, including:

* VT
* Genabelle
* Aestura
* IOPE
* Rejuran

What does everyone think about this?  Has anyone tried PDRN and had good results?  What are your favourite products?  I am particularly interested in its skin firming benefits.",2024-07-14 00:26:29+00:00,84,76

1dzvc1a,DIYaesthetics,Can PN boosters be used for upper eyelid area?,"I've experienced remarkable results after completing six courses of PN boosters on my lower eyelid area over four months. My tear troughs have filled in, and the skin has become thicker, significantly enhancing the texture around my eyes. In my 30s, I developed bumpy or ""chicken skin"" on my lower eyelids, which I initially thought was milia. However, a dermatologist explained that it was actually my sebaceous glands becoming more visible as my already delicate skin thinned with age. The improvement in skin texture has been the most satisfying outcome, as I did not have substantial volume loss or discoloration in that area.

I've used two sessions each of Ami Eye and Rejuran I, as well as one session each of Juve Eyes and Eyebella. Frankly, I couldn't distinguish whether one brand outperformed the others, as I used a different brand each time.

My question is whether PN boosters can be applied to the upper eyelids to address slight volume loss and other signs of aging. Or, should I consult a doctor and opt for HA dermal fillers for that area?",2024-07-10 13:07:05+00:00,10,21
1dxzuut,AsianBeauty,[Review] Rejuran UV Protection Cream,"If you have been lurking around Skintok, you might be more familiar with Rejuran as a form of skin booster which has been going quite viral lately. While I was in Seoul in March, I saw that they had a skin care line and decided to pick up their sun cream. I don't see a lot of reviews on their skincare line, so I hope you find it useful!

[^(How it looks like + its finish on my hands)](https://imgur.com/a/dbCAcBU)

**Sunscreens I have used**: BOJ, Isntree, Dr G Soothing up Sun, Anessa, Biore, Beplain.

**Skin profile**: Sensitive, acne-prone, Dry, Current on Tret

***Pros***

(1) **Moisturising (VERY)**

As per the product description, it is indeed moisturising. I tend to gravitate towards sunscreens that are moisturising and thinner in texture. This sun cream feels like it moisturises from within and not just forming a film on top to give the illusion of a glow. It is thicker in texture compared to BOJ, Isntree and Dr G but I do enjoy this texture more as it feels very soft on my skin.

(2) **Hyperpigmentation hero**

Other sunscreens+Tret vs Rejuran Sun cream+Tret. The latter combination fades my hyperpigmentation quicker! I have always been using sunscreen religiously and is extremely prone to hyperpigmentation. Ever since I started wearing this sunscreen 8 weeks back, my existing scars have visibly faded quicker compared to when I was using the rest.

(3) **Non Stinging**

Ever since I started tret, my skin tingles slightly whenever I apply sunscreen, if I don't layer a thick layer of heavy duty moisturiser underneath. With this sun cream, I can just apply my serums, apply a thin layer of moisturiser and it doesnt sting (even if I don't wear moisturiser).

***Cons***

(1) **Eye Sting**

It does not sting my skin but it sure stings my eyes. I now lightly powder my under eyes and the problem no longer persists.

(2) **Price**

I remember the price being quite expensive compared to other sunscreens in OY and it's 40ml. Now I have to think of ways to stock this up for the few months without sacrificing my sweet treats (I reapply twice a day)

***TLDR***  
Would definitely repurchase! Very much enjoy using it on my sensitive skin. I am based in SEA and it's relatively easy to source this but I am not sure for the rest of the regions!",2024-07-08 04:18:06+00:00,9,1

I’ve made an appointment at Shine Beam but then people on tik tok have categorized that place as an influencer spot so now thinking about making a switch to GU. 

Does anyone have experiences at either?",2024-06-30 15:40:43+00:00,3,3
1dr6mb4,DIYaesthetics,Have purchased products and am ready to use them.  Have researched physician advice re: order of application and discovered the following:,"Recommended order of application:  1.) Filler for eyes 2.) Botox 3.) Peel

Rationale is the following - Filler before botox as botox first allows filler to settle through lymphatic nodes, whereas botox before can block or restrict that process - Botox before peel as new skin may become lined if botox isn't administered prior

I've found no other guidance about the products I have.  Those with more experience than I have may have an understanding about the order of application they prefer.  They have discovered through trial and error that there is benefit in a certain order.

This leads me to the group of products I've purchased and along with recent delivery of the implements used to apply them.  I am now prepared to begin.

Do you have opinions about in what order you would apply the following and if there is a waiting time I should follow in doing so.  I have looked for answers for a good deal of time and, unfortunately, haven't unearthed guidance, likely because derms and nurse injectors have discussed this, were taught it, and don't share the following on public forums or in online videos (but, perhaps subscription channels which I am not a member of so of no help to me).

Your thoughts would be of great help to me.  I've tried to get answers before bothering those in the group, but I hope it's not a bother.  It's something I would help anyone with less experience with -- once I have the experience!  Here goes:

Revs Pro 32 (substitute for Profhilo)  (one syringe - no guidance about how many syringes needed or protocol, I will consult what's recommended for Profhilo)

Illuma Crystal Rose,  (five vials)

Juve Eyes, (one syringe, though I understand I must purchase two more to adhere to the treatment recommendations of one syringe ever 14 - 21 days until I reach three)

Botulax (after Juve Eyes) , (200 units)

Neuramis Deep (as Lip filler), (one syringe)

Iniblanc PCL (for temporal hollowing) - perhaps the last step (two syringes). Willl use cannula, was advised to use larger cannula 23G to better avoid VO

Exosome Filcore P198, (10 vials)

Lilied K (PN 2% - skin booster substitute for Rejuran Healer)  five syringes

\*\*\* in what order would you inject? \*\* If certain products are considered ""neutral"" regarding order, I would also appreciate knowing that, too :) \*\* if time is required between application?

I understand this is a LOT of information and many will be overwhelmed and skip my question.  However, if you just have one or two tidbits of advice that's great! because others may do the same and then I have information \*\*\* I am only seeking information and appreciate as much or as little as you can spare \*\*\* no timeframe, I'm not asking for ""glow up"" advice for an event \*\*\* I just would like to be responsible

I have a Dr Pen Ultima A6s I've microneedled serums - nano and 36 cartridges, 32G 4mm needles, insulin needles, mixing needles, 5 and 9 needle pins to fit syringes for more prescise meso

So you know my level of experience, I included this:

have already been administering Glutathione, Cindella, Asorbic Acid

Peptide for weight loss (in maintenance phase)

Curenex

TCA 13% to build to 30%

MN serums w pen also with hyluronic slip to build collagen

Please be kind as I am earnest in my approach and am seeking best practices

This post and its answers I believe could be a helpful guide for others - therefore less inquiries for you

Thank you very much!  I appreciate your help.  I hope I am not overthinking, but I'd rather be responsible than impulsive and unsafe.

One more question I forgot to add: I'm interested in purchasing the Gold Cell 8% PDRN for MN.  Am I tapped out with products or, heck, should I throw this one in?  It seems amazing and unique.  It's on the website Cellmade if anyone is interested.

It’s kind of a fancy place, but I still should have shopped around. Only once I got the treatment is when I started Googling the pricing, and now I think that I might have been grossly overcharged.

1dnbmzv,AsianBeauty,"Hypopigmentation from PN/PDRN injections (Nucleofill, Rejuran)?","For those who have had polynucleotide (PN/PDRN) dermal injections (Nucleofill, Rejuran), and at least 3 months have passed, could you share if you see any hypopigmentation spots in the places where the product was injected?

Some 3 months ago, I got Nucleofill Strong injections for some acne scars. Immediately after and even a few days later, the injection spots were swollen and in a lighter color, but this is expected. There were a few spots where the injection spots were larger (for the larger, deeper scars), so in these places the swelling and the lighter color remained even after a week. It looked like this (image posted by u/leit_motif):

https://preview.redd.it/dej49hyqdi8d1.png?width=891&format=png&auto=webp&s=44c880838bc14882e4dafbda1c934f22a91d0023

I did some microneedling over these spots, and it helped a lot. Now, in the past month, I have been looking at these spots more closely, and I noticed that they have a slight hypopigmentation. They are not fully white, just lighter than rest of the skin. And, interestingly, when I do microneedling over them now, they do not become red and there is no pinpoint bleeding. these spots kinda remind me of scar tissue. However, as opposed to hypopigmented scars, these injections spots are round/oval, so they are more visible. Now, I am not sure if this is permanent, but it kinda feels like it. To me it seems that there has been some fibroblast migration and therefore increased collagen (i.e. scar tissue) growth in these areas. But not in a good way, as it is noticable (not to others, but to me).

Yesterday I decided to research a bit more into it, and it appears that PN/PDRN actually has anti-melanogesis properties, as it suppresses tyrosinase activity ([link to study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5037727/)). This is very interesting, but I wish I had known this prior.

So I was wondering if anyone else has noticed something similar? And whether or not this effect (at least the hypopigmentation, is likely permanent?",2024-06-24 11:53:42+00:00,15,4

1dj6408,DIYaesthetics,Polynucleotides: Are they worth the hype?,"\*\*\*\*\*Research shows that polynucleotides can increase collagen by up to 47% in 23 days and help create a thicker, healthier epidermis with improvements of 52% in 23 days.\*\*\*\*\*



QUICK EXPLAINATION: 

*“Polynucleotides are an injectable bio-stimulator,” Dr Soni explains. The stretchy molecules are made from fragments of fish which mirror human DNA.* 

*“The purpose of injecting the product is to stimulate our own cells to produce some of the things that we lose with ageing,” explains Dr Soni. Essentially, it “can change the expression of DNA,” Dr Ward tells me. “Polynucleotides* [*boost collagen*](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a37526913/how-to-increase-collagen/) *and elastin by up-regulating the fibroblast cells, as well as improving tissue regeneration and restoring skin tone and elasticity. It has an antioxidant and hydrating effect in addition to the bio-remodelling, therefore resulting in skin that looks and feels healthier,” Dr Soni continues.  (https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a44771531/polynucleotides/#)*

# 

# What are polynucleotides and what can they help with: 

-Polynucleotides are being used to reverse the ageing of tissues and repair scarring by tackling the concern from the source. 

-It acts as a rejuvenating treatment for older skin and as a preventative treatment for younger skin. According to [https://www.harleyacademy.com/aesthetic-medicine-articles/a-practitioners-guide-to-polynucleotide-skin-boosters/](https://www.harleyacademy.com/aesthetic-medicine-articles/a-practitioners-guide-to-polynucleotide-skin-boosters/) Polynucleotides show more visible results in older patients “older patients with moderate tissue laxity tend to be the best candidates.”, 

-Derived from fragments of fish DNA (which resemble human DNA), which means they have the ability to function as a biostimulator, kick-starting regeneration in the skin

-Anti-inflammatory effect, because of their antioxidant properties

-They increase collagen production, resulting in a thicker, healthier epidermis resulting in a healthier epidermis. This makes polynucleotides an excellent option for individuals with thinning skin that sometimes makes facial veins obvious. 



# Basic Q&A on using Polynucleotides for treatments:

***When can I expect to see results?*** 

-----Seeing genuine aesthetic results from polynucleotides takes time. This is because fibroblasts take time to activate and start producing collagen and elastin. So clinical change is seen in months, not days.



***Should I use a needle or a cannula?***  

-----It can be injected with a needle into the deep dermis using a micro bolus technique. A cannula can also be used in the subcutaneous fat layer using a fanning retrograde linear thread technique.



***How many treatments will I need?*** 

-----About 2-4 sessions, 2-4 weeks apart. The amount of treatments depends on the goals of the individual. Maintenance sessions should be expected to maintain the results achieved. The amount of sessions may also vary based on the strength of polynucleotides used.

  
***Where are polynucleotides typically injected?***

 -----Under the eyes, on the face, neck, and even for the jawline and cheekbones



***Is this type of treatment painful?***

----- It can feel pinchy or stingy. Numbing before hand can make this treatment a lot more comfortable. 



***What to look for in a PN product and Product recommendations:***

I recommend going with a higher percentage if budget allows. Products like Rejuran Healer and Juve Face contain 2% PN which will give you better results than products with lower percentages.  If budget is a  factor, good options include Ami Eyes, Eyebella, Regenovue PN, or illuma Luna (which also has the added peptides for increased benefits).

# Caution:

\^\^\^\^Individuals with fish allergies CANNOT use products containing polynucleotides

\^\^\^\^Some products such as illuma PN contain partially cross-linked HA which carries a small risk of a    vascular occlusion, individuals must have the proper reversal tools available. Hyaluronidase or Liporase, sterile saline, sterile syringes, ect.



# Examples of Polynucleotides treatment applications:

* Rejuvenating treatment for older skin to treat fine lines and wrinkles
* Preventative treatment for younger skin
* Rehydration for dull skin at any age
* Treating dark circles as an alternative to tear trough fillers
* Strengthening delicate areas of skin such as around the eyes and mouth
* Reducing inflammation to helps with conditions such as rosacea
* Treating hyperpigmentation, sun damage, scarring, stretch marks and acne
* Treating alopecia and hair loss

1dayete,KoreanBeauty,Vands Samseong Coex review,"Hi all, I just came back from my Korea trip. I went to Vands Samseong after much research. The new one near to COEX. 

Just like how I had trouble finding genuine reviews abt skinclinics, I tot I can share my experience here for anyone who needs it. 

As per my own experience, I went with my mum. 

We both filled up some documents and washed our own face then got our skin analysed by a machine. It only shows our current skin's wrinkles pigments sebums etc tho. Nth abt future wrinkles unlike what we saw on tt hahaha but ok at least it is clearer than looking at the mirror. 

Then the consultant (not doctor) will gv her recommendations. 

Initially she recommended me to do:

Aqua Peel

3kinds laser

Rejuran

Exosome w potenza

Potenza tip (new needles)

Ulthera

LDM

Total to 2,200,000krw (abt 2.2k sgd)

I told her my budget was 1.5kg sgd so.. what will she suggest to remove.

In the end aft discussion and asking some qns I decided on:

Rejuran w potenza

Potenza tip (new needle head)

Ulthera 300shots focused along jawline 

LDM

Total 1,420,000krw (abt 1.4k sgd and I got back 100 tax refund so abt 1.3k!)

I think it is still a steal because ulthera is sg seems to b abv 2k aft a quick google. 

So anyway aft payment we are ushered to the treatment area where the translator applied numbing cream for us. 

Now the problem came. She missed out my underchin and the part between my nose and lips!

I only remembered abt the under chin when the doc assistants were preparing me for treatments. I asked if that area needed numbing and they asked ard then came bk to apply. So i end up waiting more than an hr for the creams to work rather than just 30mins. 

So after the cream is finally set and removed, the doc came (man, young and gentle and speaks english) and designed the area for ulthera by drawing some lines on my face and explaining where the shots will go and ask if im agreeable. 

He then did his job and asked if the pain level is ok etc. It is like a 2/10. So still bearable. 

Then his asst come by to prep me for rejuran potenza. Then he came bk to do it. It hurts more than ulthera but still bearable until he reached the part between my nose n lips, that was crazy painful I teared. That's when I remembered the translator did not put numbing cream there!!! LOL. So girls pls check ur numbing cream and dun be shy to ask.  

I told him to stop and asked for tissue. He realised Im tearing and was like awww... and gave me cotton. Then told me how much more to go and which part he is gonna do etc. 

Overall I felt taken care for despite the numbing cream incident. Didn't feel rushed or pressured or whatever. They were all really nice! I wouldn't mind going bk there again for treatment the next time I visit SK. Just rem to check ur numbing cream that it covers everywhere ur selected treatment will go. 😂

As for results. I can't see any yet. Because they take time to show! Next day felt a little bruised ard my jaw line n that's it. Can go bk to regular skincare and makeup. ",2024-06-08 08:42:37+00:00,6,2

1d6vid9,SeoulPlasticSurgery,Plastic Surgery Clinics in Seoul for Undereye Area,"Hello!

I am seeking advice for plastic surgery clinics in seould due to the puffiness of my undereyes area, as well as the volume loss that has occured particularly around the inner corners. I am in my early 20s, and I am mainly looking into undereye fat pad repositioning, and potentially fat grafting to the undereye. 

While in Seoul, I would additionally like to get Rejuran Healer, Juvelook, ultherapy, and maybe even LAMS at 365mc. In an ideal situation, I would get the Juvelook, Rejuran, Ultherapy, and the procedure at the same clinic/hospital, but I know it does not always work out like that. 

  
So far I have looked at a bunch of clinics such as the following:

Woori Plastic Surgery

LV Plastic Surgery (I mainly heard about this place in regard to dermatology, but I see they do undereye surgery)

ID Hosptial 

Miho Plastic Surgery

Nana

Wooa (althought I mainly see reviews about breast augmentation surgeries)

Sketch 

Banobagi

Private Plastic Surgery 

  
I am reaching out because different clinics have offered different procedures. At one clinic I was told I should get an incisional lower bleph, so an incision under the lash line, so they could remove excess skin and correct the bag, at another clinic I was told I should get fat grafting and an transconjunctival blepharoplasty would work. To be honest, I would much rather have a transconjunctival blepharoplasty, than the incision underneath the lash line as I do not think my skin laxity warrants removal just yet, and I am worried about disrupting the tissues and muscles in the area, as opposed to more directly accessing the fat pad through the transconjunctival incision, but then again I am not a surgeon.

My main goals for the surgery are to even out the tissue under the eyes, as well as bringing volume back to the area. I know I have darkness, but that is more due to the thinness of skin, which I am trying to remedy with 3 rounds of undereye PRP.

I have looked fairly extensively on Gangnam Unni, as well as reddit, for reviews for all of these clinics, and I am leaning towards Woori, but I am also cognizant of the fact that clinics do offer discounts for reviews. 

If anyone has advice, or personal experience at any of these clinics/with undereye surgery in Seoul, that would be greatly apreciated! ",2024-06-03 03:55:32+00:00,14,19
1d3xpcb,koreatravel,Worth visiting for Korean skincare in Seoul: Ppeum Clinic Hongdae,"I’m a typical Singaporean girl, not often making reviews on a certain being/place. But this place is worth visiting for if you are a k-beauty believer. 
Our family was in Seoul 3 weeks ago for a family trip. Visited ppeum clinic with my mum and my brother. Unlike the negative reviews on Google, I personally believe that it was a very satisfying experience.

So I went through some reviews and was quite concerned. Most reviews mention that they hold a long waiting line due to excessive number of customers. Our schedule was quite tight, due to budget issues, I chose to take this place. 

Booking was made very easily on whatsapp. I researched on my own regarding Rejuran (collagen booster) and the online staff showed me some of the promos that include rejuran along with Sylfirm (very pop microneedling in Korea). I took the package, for my mom, Oligio (Korean Thermage) for her saggy eyes and a basic facial for my brother. 

We first got on the wrong location (for Koreans), but shortly, we could find the branch for foreigners, and got shocked of its size and the facility. Clean, and very large. And there was a big reception where all the staff speak both fluent English and Chinese. Although we came early in the morning, there still were a lot of people. Not that long to spend, called our names in a few minutes. 

The pretty lady spoke perfect English, giving useful information on our family’s general concerns. Although I felt a little confused of their numerous packages, but I was sure of what I’d be getting, told her that we only want the treatments that we already have decided to get. 

My overall procedures were very fluently done. When applying numbing cream, the nurse couldn’t speak English, soon, an in-house translator hopped to me and explained the overall process in English. The lady who gave me consultation guided me to the treatment room separately for Rejuran. Doctor came in, introduced himself as the head doctor, and explained the procedures in English. It was a little bit painful, but was bearable with the pain level of 5 out of 10. Shortly after, the microneedling session started. Unlike what people said, sylfirm microneedling is not as painful as thought. Lastly with the ldm(? sort of a moisturizer), for the soothing session. Was quite disappointed with this, finished too quicker than I expected. (Didn’t really help I guess)
We got the post ops from the clinic and noted. This part is the most important one, people should check the post ops instruction and don’t miss the tax refund benefits at the clinic. They have this machine inside the clinic, that enables tax refund process. 

After 2 weeks, I see very visible difference of my skin. Although there was a little bit of swelling and redness for 3 days, I could hide them with my mask on. Especially, a huge improvement on my pores and little acne marks that annoyed me for years. 

We have many dermatologists in Singapore with fine skilled doctors, but the price in Korea is a lot cheaper, saved my budget x2. It seems this clinic has deep understanding of Singaporeans and they already know what to do. Worth visiting, budget-wise, and the overall service of the staff and doctors were satisfying. 

*P.S: There is a big shopping street nearby, and great food in the neighbourhood. Next one will be the foodie review at Hongdae if you liked my review. ",2024-05-30 06:42:37+00:00,46,18
1d374n7,KoreanBeauty,Lienjang Myeongdong review,"**I am just going to copy and paste my Google review so I don't have to retype it. **

Went to lienjang today for a consultation and a few treatments.  I was a little worried after reading some reviews but I had a good experience.

The consultation was done by someone who spoke English.  I know a little Korean and she asked if I'd prefer Korean or English and since I'm not fluent in Korean it was completed in English.  She had an accent but her English was top notch and we had no trouble communicating.  She worked with my concerns and made recommendations.  I had an idea of what I wanted to get done beforehand and she was able to tell me what would be beneficial and where.  I received potenza, Botox, juvelook, and rejuran.  There were only a few treatments that were recommended and I had to inquire about additional treatments to get them (they weren't fully necessary but I wanted to receive some other benefits).  I also requested ulthera for my under eyes and cheeks and I was told in a very honest way that it would be a waste of my money as it would not be fully beneficial for my particular face.  This would've been an easy way for them to sell me something I didn't need (and it's expensive) and it was explained on why the results would not be what I wanted.  I was given aftercare instructions and then signed that I understood them along with general waivers.  (Not sure how other people say they didn't receive aftercare instructions when you check off you understand unless they were looking for more detailed instructions)

I don't really why other reviews explained this place as being ""rushed"" but it seemed to operate at a fairly normal pace.  I had a few painful treatments and I'm actually glad they didn't take any longer than needed.

I was also expecting an ""assembly line"" but it felt fairly normal.  As others have said don't expect a spa like experience.  This isn't a place for massage spa facials it's a clinic.

If you're looking for someone to hold your hand and translate every single step for you I would speak up and ask questions.  They aren't here to coddle you.  The process was pretty straight forward though.  I set up an appointment, showed up on time, they called my name, did a consult, I chose my therapies with the consultant, paid, waited to be called, had my treatments done, and left.

I came prepared to spend a lot more but I came in waaaay under budget.  Anything that had a discount available was provided to me without being prompted.  Some of the pricing online was for multiple vials or full face vs the areas I needed and I was only sold what was needed.  There were some promotions I wasn't aware of either.

One thing that I would say they could improve on is the out processing customer service aspect.  All that really happened was them telling me I was ""all done!"" And I wasn't sure if I was supposed to just walk out.  Could be the American in me or me over thinking but adding in ""you're free to go when you're ready"" would've been a some nice direction.  

Overall, I had a good experience and received what I came in for.  Looking back at some of the reviews I want to roll my eyes but I have to remind myself that they may have had a different experience than mine and give them the benefit of the doubt. BUUUT do your research, know what you want, get an idea of what the max you'll be charged (and anything less will be a welcomed surprise), communicate and you'll probably get a similar experience to mine.",2024-05-29 08:21:24+00:00,14,3
1czu7bw,DIYaesthetics,Question about multiple treatments of PN,So with Lilied K it comes with 5 syringes.  Would you do 1 syringe every week? Or All 5 in one week.  Or 2 weeks.

1czhigu,KoreanBeauty,Experience with Polynucleotides Injection ,"Personally, I got 3 sessions of rejuran healer (a month interval), just did my 2nd session, loving the results so far, and am wondering about how it compares with the other types (i.e. rejuran i, rejuran HB plus, Lilied PN, etc). 

so I’d just like to find out about anyone’s experiences with the following products, and whether it was still painful or uncomfortable for them, when compared with (regular) rejuran healer. 

Rejuran I (rejuran for the eyes) 
- want to know if this was painful?

Rejuran HB (rejuran with HA & lidocaine) 
- if anyone’s ever tried rejuran healer and rejuran HB, was there any difference between the two? 

Lilied K (PN) 
- I read that these include lidocaine, and would like to know how it compares with rejuran injections, if it’s less painful. If you’ve had this brand injected, how was your experience?

1cz6888,DIYaesthetics,The Skin Booster Experiment: A Real-Person Review & Discussion Thread,"Hey everyone!  I've been diving deep into the world of skin boosters lately, and  the info out there can be overwhelming. I wish I'd had a central place to learn from others' experiences when I was starting out.

So, I'm creating this thread to merely help others! Here's a bit about my journey so far (feel free to ask any questions):

* Microneedling (Dr pen) with skin boosters
   * **What I've Tried** Curenex, Hyarun, GTM Gold Cell (8%),  Illuma PN, Filcore exosome, Plated intense, and bot0x.
   * Depth: 1mm around the face and 0.2mm around the eye
   * Interval: once per 4 weeks
   * Caution: watch so many videos, maintain sterile conditions, wear gloves, and stay away from sun for the next few days as there is healing involved
   * Result: Most satisfied with exosome, GTM and bot0x (if you want a glow before your big event: consider PN or PDRN and bot0x (Botox meso gave the best glow).
* Injectables:
   * **What I've Tried** Liquid PCL: Gouri , Profhilo, Diluted Radiesse (for neck)
   * Depth: 4-6mm
   * Interval: once per 4 weeks (three injections of Gouri, two profihilo and two Radiesse)
   * Caution: allergy reaction might occur for Gouri so you need to take an anti histamine before the injection. Be extremely careful with any liquid PCL injections as there's a **significant risk of VO**. I'm lucky we have a nurse in the family so I could avoid injecting myself. Stay away from this if you are a beginner as this can be extremely dangerous. Finally, you should not have any other treatment when you have liquid PCL: during the three months, I only did micro needling)
   * Result: Gouri blew my mind away and lifted my whole face, Radiesse helped a lot with horizontal neck lines, Profhilo gave me a glow for around three months
* Meso with skin booster
   * **What I've Tried:** Illuma luna around the eye, all Rejuran line, Nucleofill and exosome for face
   * Depth: 1-1.5mm around the face and 0.5-0.7 mm around the eye
   * Interval: every three-four weeks
   * Caution: maintain sterile conditions (gloves and alcohol wipes), watch videos and start with your leg to practice
   * Result: I'm new to this so can't tell much except it is surprisingly easy to DIY at home, but lord it stings and is painful

I'm hoping we can use this thread to share tips and any other info that could help someone decide if skin boosters are right for them. Thank you in advance for taking the time!",2024-05-23 22:57:24+00:00,59,69

1ctw6bh,DIYaesthetics,PCL as a skin booster in MN,"Hi everyone, I'm fairly new here and wanted to thank you all for the amazing resources. I've been learning a lot from you!

My dilemma: I'm getting ready for a baby tox experiment (40 units Botox + 4 ml skin booster) with a depth of 1 mm (debating going 1.5 mm; suggestions for depth are also welcome and much appreciated).

I've been using Curenex, Hyarun, and GTM Gold Cell, and Rejuran Healer. I've been most satisfied with GTM (8% concentration). I'd like to challenge the conventional wisdom by using PCL as a skin booster here. I understand there's some resistance in the community towards this approach. Trust me, I've heard your concerns, and I've also used Gouri injections in the past (it blew my mind). However, my hypothesis is that PCL used in needling might have a different impact.

For the experts out there: which PCL product do you recommend for MN? I'm considering Miracle L or Rejuner Black. Should I wait on combining tox with PCL? I know it's best not to use tox here but I only perform MN once a month for now (healing from a weight loss so I'm trying to be consistent here) and really don't want to repeat the MN another time as tox effect only lasts for one month when used in MN.

The most recent addition to my lab- Skinvive sample, enough for one treatment. 

I was wondering if anyone has had this done, if they have advice on the facial mapping of injections (I know it will be a grid patterning on my cheeks about 0.5cm apart, between epi and dermal layer) or any additional advice before i frankenstien my face with this  

I was also wondering for that matter- if there were also HA injectables people liked that could be substituted if I like this effect.   
  
 Finally, I want to eventually move onto Rejuran and was also curious if anyone had thoughts on this. I heard it hurts like a bitch but with 10% topical and maybe even a nerve blocker im wondering if I could do this myself... 

Final note- im a medical student. And while this actually makes me dumber than the non-medical student because it leads me to believe I can do this without adult supervision, I will say that I have dissected a human face and feel very comfortable with needles/palpating the facial anatomy

i will be travelling to seoul next month and intend to do some facial procedures. would like to know what clinic i should do my procedures at.

 i have acne scars (ice pick) so i would like to do lasers to help with the scarring. does anyone know if rejuran will be recommended for pitted/rolling acne scarring? 

i would also want to do some nose fillers or nose threads. and maybe chin filler

i have shortlisted some clinics: ppeum, LV plastic surgery, me gangnam 


ppeum seems to be most foreigner friendly, and has clear pricing on the website. but saw some reviews about them not doing the numbing cream properly. they seem to be ""elevated"" factory clinics? and use translator staff for consultation rather than speaking directly to the doctor.

LV plastic surgery seems more specialised for juvelook or rejuran and im not sure if they offer other types of services like lasers or fillers. heard that the doctor speaks english so thats a major plus for me (going through a translator seems more likely for miscommunication). 

me gangnam was recommended on tiktok but i dont see much videos or reviews. the website is not that foreigner friendly as well.

if anyone who is familiar with this topic please help to recommend a clinic, or leave any reviews/comments on these clinics 😊 thank you",2024-05-14 18:04:59+00:00,1,8

I have a Korean fiancé and his family brought me to a totally authentic Korean clinic they frequent and basically translated for me. The treatment was quickly and deftly administered by the dermatologist, who moved so skillfully throughout my face so the pain wouldn’t last too long. I literally had tears streaming down my face as she injected. I have pretty much perfect skin, but I really wanted to try this treatment since I saw so much hype online about it and it has relatively no downsides. From what the dermatologist said, I have thinner skin than Koreans, so this probably contributed to me feeling more pain. 

Right now, my face is still swollen and somewhat numb (due to the numbing pain), but I’m excited to see the results. If they’re good, I would consider enduring the pain again before a major event (I.e. wedding, etc) but probably wouldn’t get this regularly.

1bxiwoo,DIYaesthetics,Skin booster injection device advice + bonus exome advise?,"Hello! 

I'm currently having a 3x session with exomes and prdn at a clinic, but want to continue DYI after as I have been using a Dr Pen at proper lengths for some time (up to 1.8mm at the thickest points in my face) and feel confident. 

I am a little lost in choosing an injection device and their compatibility with typical skin booster ampules / headless syringes. 

I am considering: 

[5-point needle](https://www.fruugo.ca/20pcs-mesotherapy-crystal-multi-needle-5-pin-32g-15mm-crystal-multi-needle-5pins-4pns-3pins-32g-34g-10mm-125mm-15mm-mesotherapy-m/p-160168449-339941462?language=en&ac=google&utm_source=organic_shopping&utm_medium=organic)  (random link just to show image)

Hyaluron Pen 

Cheap ""professional"" Meso gun 

Atitox 

Now, I am hoping this community to be able to guide me in what is the best in terms of compatibility and practicality using skin booster ampoules and syringes. 

I want to use things like [ILLUMA Luna ](https://meamoshop.com/skin-boosters/illuma-luna/) , Rejuran HB [https://meamoshop.com/skin-boosters/rejuran-hb/](https://meamoshop.com/skin-boosters/rejuran-hb/), and vials similar to [https://meamoshop.com/skin-boosters/touch-br/](https://meamoshop.com/skin-boosters/touch-br/) 

What type of device or set up do I need to be able to use a variety like this? What is the set up you recommend for being able to use a good selection of skin boosters without too much hassle? I can compromise a little in what type of booster if it means easy application etc. 

Bonus question: 

Does anyone know an affordable umbilical chord stem cell derived exome skin booster? I've only found one Korean brand, 2XSOME SKIN BOOSTER, but they are not forward with what type of exome it is so im assuming its adipose derived... US exome products like AntiAGE is too pricy, there's also Exome 20 that I think is cheaper but do not sell to the public. Any advise appreciated.

1bs2zzn,AcneScars,7 mos after last round of 3 laser treatments and I can’t look in the mirror,"About a year ago around this time I received the first of three total profraxel laser resurfacing treatments from a clinic called Center for Plastic Surgery. In April I got the second and in June/July I got the third. After the second treatment we reviewed my progress photos using whatever sensitive camera they use and I mentioned that It thought my scars looked even more pronounced. I think this is why they decided to be really aggressive on the last round. I had numbing cream on for over an hour and the pain was excruciating. My eyes were watering so badly after the procedure but I thought pain is beauty and it was worth it. I also trusted that the practitioner knew what they were doing and this meant that I was going to see drastic results.

Fast forward to now and it’s about around the time when they say you’re supposed to be seeing improvements in your skin. That’s not what I’m seeing. I took a good hard look at myself in the mirror at work one day and almost broke down. Typically, I take my glasses off before I look because that way I won’t be able to make out the details.

I’m too afraid to dress up for special events because my face negates all the work I put into trying to look nice. What’s the point right? I hate being in photos. I can’t take a selfie except to examine my skin and see what it looks like in different lighting. I’ terrified to try dating again because that person will see my face in all sorts of lighting and they’ll see just how bad it really is.

I left a review on that clinic’s google maps and they called me back because they said they pride themselves on making their clients feel satisfied with their results but how do they intend to remedy this? I know clinics like that are only in it to make a quick buck. I’m just even more annoyed by their fake concern. I’m 35 and thought I’d be done dealing with skin problems by now. I feel so defeated and exhausted.",2024-03-31 05:40:46+00:00,107,117
1br35h6,KoreanBeauty,Effective Whitening treatments in Korea ,"I’ll be going to Seoul 29 April - 4th May. I’ve booked in Rejuran, juvelook and juvelook volume with sleep sedation. I’ll also be likely getting under eye fat transfer and hand rejuvenation at the same time + more boosters like exosomes etc as well as jaw Botox. 

I’ve had pico a number of times so I might get a session of that too while I’m there but I’m aware that is more of a regular type of thing to do. But as it’s under $100 in Korea and $500+ in aus, I’m happy to just get a session anyway!

All the skin boosters even? 
Is it ok to combine that many treatments in one sitting?

Also would you recommend doing them early or late in the trip? I was thinking early in case anything happens but the more research I do, it seems as though before I leave is best?

When it comes to PN and pdrn. It has to be something really good for me to meso. I have a decent pain tolerance, but when doing meso, it may take me a full day or even 2 days for full face.

I like the illuma PN and illuma Luna. Regenovue PN has been posted by many influencers, but after trying illuma, I like that better. 

If you have info or have used theses I'd love your feedback .


Eyes
Illuma Luna
Non-cross linked hyaluronic acid (HA): 5mg
Polynucleotide (PN): 10mg
Pentapeptide-13: 0.05mg
Tripeptide-29: 0.05mg
Dipeptide-2: 0.05mg

PN Polynucleotides – 5 mg/ml 
Cross-linked hyaluronic acid – 12 mg/ml
Peptides 0.05mg/ml- Acetyl Hexapeptide-8,Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4

You get more with illuma PN with more ingredients for a better price than Regenovue PN. 

I feel like there are more ingredients, but I could not find anything else . If someone else has info please post that info.

Rejuran I ( eye)
PN (Polynucleotide) 1%

Rejuran healer

195xwpt,DIYaesthetics,Polynucleotides for skin rejuvination,"

Rejuran Healer is great if you can afford it. Other options exist such as lumi eyes, Ami eyes, Regenovue PN, lluma Luna, illuma Luna, and more.

Personally, I prefer the illuma Luna and Pn. Both are affordable, contain added biomimetic peptides, and contain high concentrations of PN. 

The illuma Luna is great for mesotherapy and for delicate areas such as around the eyes. 
Can be used for micro-needling as well.

Illuma Pn is great for full face and neck rejuvination (I recommend this product for micro-needling) because it does have some cross linked Hyaluronic acid. 

Collagen and Elastin Stimulation: Polynucleotides trigger the body’s natural production of collagen and elastin. Collagen provides structural support and firmness to the skin, while elastin contributes to its elasticity. The decline in these proteins due to ageing leads to wrinkles and skin laxity. Polynucleotides help reverse this by boosting the production of these essential proteins.

Improvement in Skin Hydration and Texture: They enhance the skin’s hydration levels and texture. This is achieved by improving the skin’s capacity to retain moisture, leading to a more hydrated and plump appearance.

Cellular Regeneration Promotion: Polynucleotides are effective in encouraging the repair and renewal of skin cells. This is particularly beneficial for skin damaged by environmental factors, helping to mitigate the effects of ageing accelerated by external stressors.

Integration with Natural Skin Processes: The treatment aligns with the body’s natural skin processes. This ensures that the enhancements are effective and maintain a natural appearance.

By stimulating collagen and elastin, polynucleotides not only improve the skin’s firmness and elasticity but also its ability to stay hydrated and smooth. This comprehensive approach to skin rejuvenation addresses various signs of ageing, making polynucleotide treatments a reliable option for those seeking effective skin care solutions. The treatment’s compatibility with the body’s own mechanisms ensures that the results are both impactful and harmonious with the natural properties of the skin, offering a rejuvenated appearance that feels as natural as it looks.

Reducing Ageing Signs: These treatments directly target common ageing signs like wrinkles, fine lines, and skin sagging.They stimulate collagen and elastin production, essential for maintaining skin firmness and elasticity.

Enhancing Skin Hydration and Texture: Polynucleotides significantly boost skin hydration and improve overall texture.They enhance the skin’s moisture retention capabilities, resulting in a plumper and smoother appearance.

Promoting Skin Rejuvenation and Regeneration: The treatments excel in rejuvenating and regenerating skin cells. They are particularly beneficial for skin that has suffered environmental damage, aiding in repair and renewal.

Addressing Scarring and Hyperpigmentation: Polynucleotides effectively reduce the appearance of scars, including those from acne, and help even out skin tone. They work on reducing hyperpigmentation, leading to a more uniform skin complexion.
Improving Skin Elasticity: The treatments contribute to enhanced skin elasticity. This benefit is especially noticeable in areas prone to elasticity loss, such as the under-eye region and neck.

Treating Sun-Damaged Skin: Polynucleotides are adept at treating sun-damaged skin, mitigating some effects of UV exposure. They improve skin texture and reduce the visibility of sunspots.

Revitalising Overall Skin Health: Beyond targeting specific issues, polynucleotide treatments offer holistic skin revitalisation.They improve the overall health and vitality of the skin, contributing to a rejuvenated appearance.

18ga9qc,koreatravel,"The Actual Dark Side of Plastic Surgery in Seoul, South Korea - (rhinoplasty, rhino, blepharoplasty, canthoplasty, DES, double eyelid, face lift, facelift, FC, facial contour, double jaw, zygoma reduction, rejuran, botox, calves, calf, buccal, laser, liposuction, lipo, fat graft, primary, revision)"," The narrative that has been widely perpetuated is that Korean translators are taking advantage of foreigners who visit Seoul for plastic surgery (PS). I have nothing to say on that matter because the few translators I have used have been seemingly honest. What i have found, though, is that it is actually some of the other foreign patients who are in Seoul for PS who are taking advantage of uninitiated foreigners.

Story time: I joined a Kakao Talk group chat for people traveling to Seoul for plastic surgery in November 2023. The administrator of said group made it a requirement for joining the group chat that a person had to create an event in the group chat calendar and share 1) their real name, 2) their travel dates (arrival and departure), and 3) their clinics. 

Like a good unsuspecting foreigner, I did as I was asked and joined the group chat with about 15 to 20 or so other unsuspecting foreigners, all very happy to share this information so that we could offer and receive support and meet up with other women and men traveling to Seoul in November for PS. On the day of my arrival, I shared with the group that I would be heading to XQueen (pseudonym) women's clinic for a consultation and would meet up with some of the other women afterwards. During my consultation I received a quote for, among other things, 600 shots of Jilsera laser tightening. The quote I received for the Jilsera alone was 2.2 million KRW. I told XQueen that I would give it some thought and get back with them. A week or so later, I contacted XQueen and asked if I could come in that day for the procedure but they did not have time. I therefore began looking around at other women's clinics. I looked at two other clinics, Podo and Golden. I consulted at one of them and had my translator call one of them. Their price for 600 shots of Jilsera: 980K KRW (Podo) and 580K KRW (Golden, where my translator called and they did not know I was a foreigner). Why a $1.2m - 1.6m KRW ($900 - $1,200 USD) difference in price from XQueen? Well, mind you, I did not share my plan to visit Podo with anyone. So here is where it gets interesting folks. Ostensibly, someone from the group chat called XQueen and asked for referral commission. Keep reading to see how it works.

During this trip to Seoul (my second trip) I learned from a Korean friend that commission for referrals is some of the easiest money that can be made in the Seoul PS industry. It goes like this: all a person needs to know is your name and the clinic you're visiting. They call up the clinic and say ""Oh, Sally was not interested in your clinic but I heard good things about your clinic and convinced Sally to go to you, can I get a referral commission?"" The clinic says no problem and tacks on the commission to your surgery price. Easy as that. That is right, the unsuspecting foreigner pays more just because they have either 1) shared their clinic plans with a seasoned PS vet who pretends to be their new super supportive friend or 2) joins a ""supportive"" Kakao Talk group chat for purposes of meeting up and shares their clinic plans (the administrators of these group chats love to call these chats ""official"" or ""verified"" and often the group chat will correspond with a season or month in which the unsuspecting foreigner plans to visit Seoul. No such thing as official or verified group chat, but I digress). Upshot: your clinic plans are being used to make commissions and get free and discounted surgery sometimes from folks who are pretending to be your BFFs. That is the hustle. Laid bare for all to see.

My tips: DO NOT SHARE YOUR CLINIC PLANS WITH ANYONE UNTIL AFTER YOU HAVE BEEN TO YOUR CONSULTATION AND GOTTEN YOUR PRICE. MAKE CLEAR AT ALL OF YOUR CLINICS THAT NO ONE REFERRED YOU. DO NOT TAKE ANYONE BUT YOUR TRANSLATOR TO YOUR CLINICS. IF A REQUIREMENT TO JOIN A KAKAO TALK GROUP CHAT IS TO SAY YOUR NAME OR CLINIC, GIVE A FAKE NAME AND GIVE THE NAME OF ONE OF THE BIG FACTORY CLINICS WHERE YOU HAVE NO INTENTION OF GOING.

Let me be clear, Seoul has some of the best plastic surgeons in the world. Going to Seoul for PS can pay dividends! Also, one of my favorite activities is meeting new and interesting people from the group chats who are in Seoul for PS. And most of the foreigners in those chats, especially those there for the first or second time, are good and honest folks. However, there are a couple of unsavory characters who have been to Seoul for PS multiple times and who are pretending to be your friend while making money and getting free and discounted surgery at your expense.

17f2iay,KoreanBeauty,"Anyone travelling to Seoul for treatment, please avoid Ppeum clinic for your own sake","I'm Irish, and don't speak great Korean - so some of this could usually be put down to miscommunication, but I know that's not the case this time! 

I'm on holidays in Seoul and booked in 2 seperate days of various treatments (but with consultation for advice as well) with PPEUM global clinic. The first day I got there, I did my consultation and they offered pore cleansing, v laser for redness, 2 cryocell treatments, and 2cc Rejuran Healer for about 600,000 Korean won. She told me that would be spread over my two appointments - the first appointment would be the redness laser and cryocell, the next appointment (today) would be a pore cleanse/extraction, Rejuran and another cryocell.

Well.. first appointment, I got ""V laser for redness"" and a ""cryocell cooling treatment"".. all went fine (that's about 100,000 won). It was a bit dirty and impersonal, but look that's what you pay for i guess.

Second appointment (today) I get in and they have no record of my second appointment and offer no refund, and even call me a liar, saying I must have gotten it all done the first day and I just ""don't remember"" (wtf?). I ask them why would I pay for 2 cryocell treatments if I only had one appointment?? That's when they became rude and  told me to leave. Literally sitting outside the clinic crying rn because I'm out all this money and I feel like an idiot!

Avoid Ppeum, I think they thought because I was foreign it was fine to take my money and treat me like that :(",2023-10-24 02:44:19+00:00,920,66

15li5ib,PlasticSurgery,Price of Rejuran 2cc?,"I'm looking to get Rejuran injections under my eyes to help with the appearance of my bags as I near 35... I got priced 9k Thai Baht which is around £200 and also offered 5 areas of Botox for 3.5k Baht which is around £80. 
For both they offered 11k Baht which is around £250.

The price of Botox is good imo but I'm unsure of Rejuran, I did think it would be a bit cheaper in Bangkok but the clinic seems to be a fairly good one and I don't know any in the UK that do it.

The reviews are quite good for the clinic so I think I'm in safe hands but I have no idea how to get an average price quote. Any advice would be helpful, thank you ☺️",2023-08-08 13:24:22+00:00,0,0

A lot of people seem to recommend Lienjang and Muse clinic... does anyone know other top rated English speaking clinics? They also don't seem to have PSA mentioned on their website so is that a separate service? 

Renovo also claims to be #1 but think i've seen that claim at a few other clinics... any insight from personal experiences would be appreciated! :) 

My skin treatment wish list (not sure if this is overkill for 1-2 days): 

* HIFU Shurink 
* Pico Toning
* Excel V laser
* Chanel injection (aka Filorga NCTF / Rejuran Healer)
* Skin botox 
* Aqua Peel
* Botox for wrinkles
* Juverderm fillers for smile / neck lines",2023-05-17 00:25:04+00:00,6,9
13afrf1,koreatravel,Dermatologist & spa in Korea,"hello all! I’m currently in Korea and want to go to a dermatologist to remove a mark I have next to my nose. I’m not too sure what it is, it appeared when I hit puberty. I was told it has to be lasered off. 

I have tried WhatsApping and insta-dm a few places but they don’t reply. 
I am particularly interested in Dream Clinic as they claim to specialise in laser. Does anyone have experience there or know how to book and appointment? Am open to suggestions of other places as well! 

Ps am also thinking of visiting Shangpree, anyone has review and experience?

ETA: I ended up visiting dream plastic surgery, and did a laser (500,000krw) plus rejuran injection (1,500,000krw) plus an acne injection (40,000krw). The dermatologist was on leave so treatment was done by a plastic surgeon (Dr Yoo Won Jae) instead. I had an interpreter who spoke English that was assigned to follow me through the whole process. The doctor also spoke quite fluent English. Overall had a good experience here!",2023-05-07 06:57:44+00:00,3,5
