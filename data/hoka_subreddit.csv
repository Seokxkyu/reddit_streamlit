1ju0hpu,Hoka,Hoka Help,"Hey all, I just want to start by saying I‚Äôve heard great things about Hokas and when I saw a pair of Bondi 8s for clearance I snatched them up! The box said they where a 8, I wear a 9, but looking at them now the shoe says US 11.5D. Whats with that? My foot fits fine, heal sits back and well, and about a inch or so of wiggle room for my toes.

Anyway, Ive been working my 8 hour shifts with them and they don‚Äôt hurt my feet after my shifts like numerous other shoes have. But they make my feet sore. Im used to breaking in new shoes/boots all the time and usually by this time of heavy wearing and usage my feet either get used to it, or they‚Äôve been broken in. Not these Hokas though‚Ä¶ my archs feel sore after all the support these shoes give them, but its only while wearing them, not walking around barefooted. I wore them tight at first. Then after this soreness I tried them a little loose and they feel definitely better.

Whats going on? Did i get the wrong size? Width? Style? Id like some help please. I stand at work all day, 8 hours a day on tile or hard carpet, nothing soft, and never sit. Thank you. ",2025-04-08 00:15:16+00:00,1,0
1jtserg,Hoka,Hoka Clifton ?,"Hi All!! I‚Äôm getting back into running and have really been enjoying the Hoka Clifton 9. 

With the 10 releasing in a few days, my question is 

I noticed they went from a 5mm to a 8mm drop

How much of a difference will that make? 

Is that something only extreme runners will notice?

1jsbli2,Hoka,Hokas seem to make feet hurt?,"Hello all, about a year and a half ago I broke my ankle. While I was laid up I purchased a pair of Hoka Arahi 6 shoes as they were listed as a stability shoe and I presumed that would help with rehabbing my ankle. Since then I‚Äôve played around with zero drop and barefoot type shoes. I‚Äôve noticed that while wearing my minimalist shoes I don‚Äôt get much for foot pain. I primarily wear the hokas when I‚Äôm walking around and going to be on my feet for a while. But when I‚Äôm wearing my hokas, my bottom feet muscles get sore as if they‚Äôre almost working harder? The muscles I‚Äôm referring to are between the heel and ball both in the arch and on the outside of my foot, also my calf seems to tighten up some. It‚Äôs not brutal or unbearable but they‚Äôre soar compared to the others. My barefoot/minimalist shoes seem to cause the heel/ball of my foot to get sore when I‚Äôm on my feet for a bit which I assume is due to lack of cushioning and shock absorption. I would think with all the cushion that the hokas would be easier on the feet. Any opinions? What would cause this? ",2025-04-05 19:34:00+00:00,0,10
1jrw7oo,Hoka,Clifton 9 - good for me?,"Likely going to purchase these soon.

Any other heel strikers out there who can vouch for these? With the price I really want to be sure. I know I could go back and exchange or warranty them if I wanted, but still.

The Nike Pegasus 41 are probably my 2nd choice atm. And then maybe the Asics Novablast 5.

1jrdduh,Hoka,Searching for a specific shoe,"I hope this isn't too weird, but during the holidays I was searching for a good pair of shoes for my mom. My fianc√© had recommended hoka and I ended up seeing a shoe I really liked on the Hoka website (for myself), but held off from buying them until after the holidays.

They were very unique, and almost futuristic design. The base color was a cream/eggnog and there was like this silicone/plastic-y/shiny black outer layer. Almost like an exoskeleton üòÖ

When I came back to the website after the holidays, they were gone and I've not been able to find them no matter how much I've searched (at this point I just want to know the name). If my fianc√© didn't distinctly remember them too, I would just write it off as a dream.

Just wanted to shout out the Hoka Bondi SR for completely changing how I move through my day. I‚Äôm a mom of three and walk at least 10,000 steps daily between school runs, errands, and everyday parenting chaos.

Before I found this shoe, I was constantly dealing with back pain, and my right foot would literally give out after too much walking. I‚Äôd limp my way home more often than not, and honestly figured that was just something I had to live with.

But I got the Bondi SR two weeks ago and... WOW. I can now walk so much more without that awful pain in my back or foot. I even hit 15,000 steps recently and came home feeling fine. Not sore, not limping‚Äîjust fine. It completely blew my mind. I had no idea shoes could make that much of a difference.

Turns out I‚Äôd just been wearing the wrong shoes this whole time. And I never would‚Äôve tried Hoka if it weren‚Äôt for this subreddit and the YouTubers who reviewed them. So seriously, THANK YOU. ü•πüòçü©∑ This shoe hands-down saved my feet and back.",2025-04-02 12:26:04+00:00,7,0

1jmwvxp,Hoka,Hoka Clifton 9 Sizing Experience ‚Äî Wearing 9 vs 9.5 After a Year of Use,"
I've been wearing my **Hoka Clifton 9s (size 9.5)** for about a year now. 

They've been my go-to for almost everything ‚Äî mostly gym sessions, but also runs (anywhere from 3 to 5 miles) and a lot of daily walking. 

I aim for about **10,000 steps per day**, and anytime I‚Äôm going on a longer walk, I usually grab these.

At this point, they‚Äôre **completely broken in** and feel extremely comfortable. 

I love Hoka for the support ‚Äî I have **very high arches**, which is the opposite of most people's issue with flat feet. 

I usually wear **orthotics** in my other shoes (like my New Balance 550s), but I **don‚Äôt need them** with the Clifton 9s and I‚Äôm still pain-free.

### **New Pair, Different Size**

Recently, my wife got me a **brand new pair of Clifton 9s** ‚Äî but I accidentally gave her the wrong size. She bought me a **size 9**, while my current pair is a 9.5.

Here‚Äôs what I noticed comparing them:

- **Size 9.5**:  
  - Fits great in terms of **width**  
  - There‚Äôs about a **full inch of toe space**  
  - No pain, very roomy  

- **Size 9**:  
  - **Better toe spacing** ‚Äî less wiggle room  
  - Width feels a **bit tighter**, but not uncomfortable  
  - Shoe feels snug overall, but it‚Äôs brand new so I expect it to break in  
  - No foot pain even without orthotics so far

---

### **My History with Hoka**

Before the Clifton 9s, I ran the **2019 Chicago Marathon** in a pair of **Hoka Bondi 1.5s**. Zero pain. I‚Äôve been a big fan of Hokas ever since. I like how much **support and cushion** they give, and I appreciate how **easy they are to find** locally (shoutout to Nordstrom) or online.

### **Question for You All**

1jlgtig,Hoka,What‚Äôs going on with Transports squeaking?,"So, a year ago I bought a pair of Transports, loved them so much, I bought a second pair in a different color the same week. The second pair began squeaking the first time I wore them, so they got returned right away. 

A week later the first pair started squeaking, so I tried the trick of putting powder under the insole(not using anything custom, just the one that came with the shoe). That works well, but they still squeak occasionally, and require powder regularly, so I went back to Clifton‚Äôs. 

Recently I went on a trip to the UK and wanted a pair of GTX, in case of rain, so I gave the Transport GTX‚Äôs a try. I wore them for a week straight in the UK with no issues, so I bought a second pair in another color assuming the squeaking issue was resolved.

1jjdozn,Hoka,Hoka Bondi vs Gaviota ‚Äì Which is better for flat feet + overpronation with custom insoles?,"Hey folks,

I have pretty bad overpronation and flat feet, and I wear custom insoles specifically designed for flatfoot correction. I'm currently looking for a pair of Hokas that give me that ultra-plush, ""Rolls Royce ride"" kind of feel but also work well with my foot mechanics.

I‚Äôve narrowed it down to the **Hoka Bondi** and the **Hoka Gaviota**. I know the Bondi is known for its max cushion and comfort, but it‚Äôs a neutral shoe. The Gaviota, on the other hand, is a stability shoe with the J-Frame support.

My main concerns:

* Will the Bondi be too soft and unsupportive for my overpronation, even with the custom insole?
* Does the Gaviota still offer that plush ""luxury ride"" feeling despite being more structured?
* Which of these handles custom insoles better in terms of fit and comfort?
* And **would the built-in arch support in the Gaviota fight or interfere with my custom insole‚Äôs arch shape**?

Would love to hear from anyone who‚Äôs been in a similar boat or has tried both.

Thanks!",2025-03-25 07:15:37+00:00,5,11

1jg91zq,Hoka,Recommendations for UPS,"Hello,

About a year ago, I bought my Dad his first pair of Hoka (Clifton 8). He works for UPS in an industrial sector and does many miles on his feet each day, while carrying boxes. 

He loved the shoes, but joked that they'll last about 6 weeks. He was slightly off, but not by much. They lasted him 9 weeks before becoming worn to the point where his balance was affected. 

Fast forward to now, and he's gone through 2 pairs of Cliftons and 2 pairs of Kawanas in less than a year. 

He loves the shoes and the support they provide when newer, but really needs something more durable. Are there any models of Hoka that can withstand the conditions that he puts them through? 

Price is not an issue, because I want to reduce the pain he feels in his feet, knees, and hips. Once the shoe starts to deteriorate, his pain returns gradually until it's time for a new pair. 

Please provide me with recommendations if there are Hokas that seem to fit his needs! I'm not sure if I'll have to switch brands, or continue the constant purchase cycle. 

Thank you! I appreciate your time!

1jfxqr7,Hoka,Life Changing!,"I've never worn sneakers in my life excepting a short period where I trained for roller derby. I'm not athletically inclined in the least.

I don't like the look of sneakers and never considered them as an option, but couldn't take the chronic foot pain anymore. HOKA was recommended as the best sneaker for the feet and I decided to head to two HOKA stores to buy a pair. I first bought the Bondi 9 and they felt like clouds. Never experienced a more incredible feeling on my feet in my life. I hated how they looked though since I only wear dresses and skirts, and ended up exchanging them for the Ora Primos because they were weird enough for me to find stylish. While they do not feel like clouds the way the the Bondis did, they have completely obliterated my foot pain. Walking for hours doesn't hurt anymore, and the pain on top and bottom are completely gone. It's unreal. I do have to say for 99 percent of folks who like sneaker looks, there is nothing like the feeling of the Bondi 9's. I'm going to go get a pair, but right now the Ora Primos are doing it for me. Hard to get on without a struggle, but once they are one they feel great! I'll never buy anything but HOKA's moving forward except for the rare fancy event where I need a dress shoe.

1jfx7j5,Hoka,They changed Bondi 8‚Äôs,"I started a job about 6 months ago where I‚Äôm on my feet all day on slab concrete. I had running shoes at the time and my feet BURNED half way through a shift

Looked into what would be most comfortable and got a pair of Bondi 8‚Äôs. It was like magic. They were bouncy on the heel, almost felt like they had too much arch support, like I could feel it pushing on my arch, but I got used to it by the end of the first shift and boom, zero foot pain.

For MONTHS I was totally pain free. My feet got tired but zero pain.

It‚Äôs been almost a full six months since I got that pair and my feet were hurting again. Doing 10 miles a day in them wore them out fast. That‚Äôs to be expected.

So I hunted for another pair, which is a pain in the ass to get them in my size. Finally found them, paid out the ass again.

Just finished a shift in them and my feet hurt worse than they did in the wore out ones. On top of the normal burn on the heel, there‚Äôs shooting pain down the middle inside of my feet, if you‚Äôve ever had your feet start to flatten from poor arch support, that‚Äôs the feeling I‚Äôm talking about.

In the last six months, something changed. All the support is gone, the inside sole is HARD, no bounce at all, I‚Äôm furious because they‚Äôre expensive and it‚Äôs literally the same shoe I just got, but a totally different experience.

Anyone know exactly what happened? I know a fiscal year for the company probably elapsed in that time, so my guess is that they changed something about the materials or maybe their production process.

1jeago5,Hoka,My review of the Bondi 8 & Clifton 9,"I recently bought the Bondi 8 and Clifton 9, and while both are solid options from Hoka‚Äôs lineup, I found myself leaning toward the Bondi 8 for a few key reasons. Starting with fit, the Bondi 8 has a notably narrow toebox, which might feel snug for some. I‚Äôd recommend going half a size up to get a more comfortable fit, especially if you prefer a bit more room up front. The Clifton 9, on the other hand, offers a wider toebox, which is great for those who need extra space for their toes to splay. However, its midfoot feels narrow due to the high arch support, which can hug the foot a little too tightly for my liking.

When it comes to stability, the Bondi 8 stands out. Its wider base provides a planted, secure feel that inspires confidence, whether I‚Äôm walking or running. The Clifton 9‚Äôs base, by contrast, isn‚Äôt as wide or stable, and I noticed it didn‚Äôt feel as grounded, especially on uneven surfaces. The Bondi 8‚Äôs max cushioning also gives it a plush, supportive ride that I found more forgiving over longer stretches, while the Clifton 9, though lighter and more responsive, didn‚Äôt match that level of comfort for me.

Overall, I prefer the Bondi 8. Its stability and cushioning outweigh the narrow toebox (easily fixed with a half-size increase), making it my go-to over the Clifton 9, which, despite its wider toebox, loses points for a less stable base and a constricting midfoot. If you‚Äôre torn between the two, try them on‚Äîsizing up might just seal the deal!

1jbw6ms,Hoka,The Clifton L,"Hey guys. I just bought a couple new pairs of Hokas, those being the Elevon X and the Clifton L. I have never worn Hokas before, but I tried them on in the store and they felt great. The store didnt have the color I wanted though, so I had to order on the internet. 

So my Elevon X shoes have arrived. Still waiting on my Cliton L's. The Elevons feel fantastic on my feet. For those of you who know about the Clifton models, how does the Clifton L compare in feel and cushioning and all that to the other Cliftons. Is a Clifton L the same as a Clifton 9, excepting the leather? Or are there major differences. 

Also I have seen several posts about Hoka shoes falling apart after like 3 months. Can anyone speak to that? Thank you",2025-03-15 14:22:28+00:00,2,1

They were a dream, my feet couldn‚Äôt tell they‚Äôd been walking 20k steps per day. Since that trip, I‚Äôve worn them regularly, but not every day as I work from home and don‚Äôt need to go out all that often. I only use them as casual walking shoes. The bottom of my left shoe has rubber lifting. Is this normal after only a month? I love the shoe but this is disappointing. I haven‚Äôt been rough on them, I‚Äôve just been walking!

1jagmir,Hoka,Advice for Greece Trip,"I love Hokas.  They are the only sneakers I buy now.  I've had two pairs of Clifton 8s that I still use, but they're pretty worn down now.  I have a newer pair of Clifton Ls that I use for everyday wear and a couple mile walks.

I am going to Greece for 17 days in two months, and I only want to bring one pair of shoes.  We will be doing a lot of walking.  I am assuming most days will be 20k+ step days.  We will also be hiking some.  The longest hike will be Samaria Gorge in Crete.  It is 18km and reviews say it is pretty rocky.

I was going to wear my Clifton Ls, but I am a little worried they will get too chewed up, and I also don't want to totally ruin them because I like the way they look.  I've been considering buying trail runners for hiking for a long time because I've always had issues with boots.  I want to buy Speedgoat 5s, but I am worried about wearing them the whole time I am in Greece, which will include plenty of city walking too.  I'm not sure if they will be comfy enough for all the city walking.

**So my question is, with average of 20k+ step days, hiking and city walking, should I wear Clifton Ls or Speedgoat 5s?**

**Update: or do I buy a new pair of Clifton 9s?  Same concern, need them to work for cities and hikes.**",2025-03-13 16:51:52+00:00,2,12

I work at a retail store about 5 hours 3 times a week, this is the extend of the use of these shoes with some exceptions when I throw them in sometimes to go to the store or something.

Does anyone know why the Hoka Clifton 9 is causing so much pain? Is it because I got used to the 8mm stack height of the NewBalance and the Hoka Clifton is 5mm? Is Clifton more supportive than my other models so with my custom orthotics, it was just way too supportive?

1j5aer2,Hoka,women's Bondi 7 questioning authenticity,"Well  here's my7 Bondi 7  dilemma.

¬†Background: As you probably know they discontinued Bondi 7 a¬†few years ago, but brought it back (recently?) in a few limited colors. I am interested in the black-and-white version which is not one that was renewed.

Anyway, a new Bondi7¬† showed up on eBay in my women‚Äôs size.. the look of it - in terms of the give/stiffness seems spot on. But there are three possible weird things:

1. The innersole, though it says Hoka, is not the deep blue color, nor does it have the words ortholite and the indentations with numbers, etc.¬†(I will not use the inner sole, but my own orthotics, anyway).
2. The tag is not the same dimensions as other Bondi 7 tags I have ..also it says 10W, and I am not used to seeing the W in Hoka  women‚Äôs shoes.(W stands for medium width for women. D is wide for women‚Äôs shoes, When nothing is written, it implies medium). In the 3 pair of Bondi 7 I had in the past, there was never a W.
3. Bondi 7‚Äôs have ventilation holes on the platform,¬† and all my previous ones have ONE ventilation hole that is larger than the rest. On this purchased model, that is not the case.(Ventilation hole is there in photo of left shoe, almost looking like a square).

I contacted Hoka customer service. They knew way less about any of this than I did, but said they‚Äôd try to get more info. Guy never called back. He  offered  one possible tidbit: he thought when they discontinued Bondi 7, the customers base was so irate that when they brought the shoes back,  it was perhaps a rush job. He thought maybe that's why these might have these different variables. I'm not so sure.

Thoughts?

These shoes are $100, vs. others new online for about $160, but as I said, this color configuration doesn‚Äôt exist now.

This is my first time posting on this sub. I've seen a lot of complaints about the Arahi 7, but not this specific answer so thought I would ask...

I loved my Arahi 6s like I never loved a shoe, but it's time for new ones. I tried the 7s on and they felt narrow around the pinky toe and tight at the heel in store but seemed to fit around the big toe so I bought them. Ran 2 easy miles to get comfortable with them this morning and really hated the way the pinky side and heel felt - way worse than expected. 

So for those of you who got the 7s and didn't love them initially, did you keep them? And did they start to feel better? As in, did they wear in eventually? I know I can't return them and don't really have the budget to just buy another pair of shoes immediately if I don't need to, but of course don't want to risk injuring myself either.

1j3h3z4,Hoka,Grounds for filing a warranty claim? Mach6 less than 90 days old with less than 100 treadmill only miles. Decal peeling off.,"I bought these Mach6s from Fleetfeet in early December. However, this Fleetfeet did not have the size and color I wanted, so they did indeed purchase them from Hoka, and then I picked them up from the Fleetfeet once they arrived.

These shoes have been only used on the treadmill and have less than 100 miles on them (the treadmill is literally the only surface these shoes have touched - I wear a different pair of shoes and put on these Hokas while sitting on the edge on the treadmill). When I am not using them, they sit on a shelf in my closet. Somehow, the outer decal on the right shoe is starting to peel. While this doesn‚Äôt impact performance, I think it is certainly a craftsmanship issue which is listed on their site as a valid reason for a warranty claim. 

Given the fact that I personally did not purchase these from Hoka (Fleetfeet did, though), will I have to pay return shipping? And if I do, does anyone know around how much it‚Äôd cost? (I reside in the US). Should I just dab some superglue and call it a day instead of dealing with this?

TLDR; lightly used and recently purchased Mach6 have a clear craftsmanship issue, but I am wondering if it‚Äôs worth the hassle and potential cost to file a warranty claim or either fix the issue myself/ignore it.

I‚Äôve been a loyal **Hoka** user for a long time and recently got a pair of **Tecton X3** from Sportshoes. However, after only about **150 km (93 miles)** of use, I noticed **symmetrical fabric tearing on both shoes**. What‚Äôs frustrating is that the **outsole is barely worn**, so it‚Äôs clear the shoes haven‚Äôt been overused or abused.

This is the first time I‚Äôve had such an issue with a Hoka shoe, and I‚Äôm really disappointed, considering the **premium price tag**. I‚Äôve already reached out to Sportshoes and Hoka about it, but I wanted to check here to see if anyone else has faced similar durability problems with this model.

I replaced the insoles with the Superfeet Green (I have a high arch) insoles. Wore them for a few days to break them in. Then I backpacked the 240 mile long, John Muir Trail in the Sierra Nevada range, California. 240 miles (the JMT is 211 miles from Whitney to Happy Isles in Yosemite, but I had to hike extra to get to Whitney) on a rocky mountain trail over 3 weeks. Not one single blister and no hot spots (I did wear toe socks) - one of the most comfortable shoes I've ever bought. I only had Merrills earlier, but their Moab 3 shoe quality is awful. I thus wanted to get a reliable pair for this trip. 

The shoes were really abused on a trail like this, and thus needed to be replaced once I finished my trip. But man, did they deliver. I was so happy with them that I bought 3 additional pairs of the Speedgoat 5 (I heard negative reviews about the 6), before they become unavailable, as they are discontinued - so I'm set for a couple of years.

1ivvnnr,Hoka,Last pair of Hokas,"I've been buying Hokas for myself and my spouse since 2020, and while I've noticed some quality downgrade over this period, the brand still seemed worthwhile to me. Well, lesson learned. 

I go through about 2 pairs a year (it's basically all I wear), so I like to sometimes buy an extra to have on-hand. I bought a new pair in January to store, and started using my ""stashed"" pair, bought 17 months earlier (which were a different color than my usual, so I didn't get to them as fast). They seemed a little weirdly tight, especially on the right side, but I figured it would be ok after a few wears. Well, a month later I had bursitis on my outer mid-right foot. I tried on my newest just-bought pair, and they didn't pinch in that spot at all. My partner tried them both and verified that the one shoe was defectively made. I figured this would be a quick fix from Hoka. But Hoka CS refused to help since the purchase date was over a year ago.

I understand if this were a preference issue, but for a defect?? Seems pretty ridiculous to punish a long-time customer who trusted in the brand enough to feel confident in buying and storing extra pairs. To make matters worse, when CS decided not to help, they additionally sent over a guide on stretching the shoe, which, as a disabled person with mobility issues (aka, why I need extra cushioned yet stable shoes in the first place), isn‚Äôt just absurd‚Äî it‚Äôs dangerous. Bursitis and the potential for skin infections is something I definitely can't mess around with. And Hoka didn't care that the defect caused me to have an injury-- they just recited the warranty and basically said too bad so sad.

So I‚Äôm done with the brand, and wanted to share this feedback with the community, as I will now be relying on similar feedback to try and find a more reputable and good quality brand.",2025-02-22 23:03:43+00:00,0,13

1itiybc,Hoka,Bondi 9 are a huge down grade from the Bondi 8‚Äôs,"Long time Bondi owner. Practically the only shoe I have bought for years at this point. I really was excited to get my Bondi 9‚Äôs but after seeing them and trying them on I am very disappointed.

There are several down grades. 

1) everything about the profile of the shoe is smaller, except for the height. 

   The previous generations of Bondi had an almost comically wide shoe base that made the shoe look like it came out of kingdom hearts. That wide base gave the shoe a lot of grounding support. Bondi‚Äôs already were a ‚Äútall shoe‚Äù so the extra width was nice. It kept me from rolling my ankles. 

All that is gone now. The shoe has an almost normal width to a running shoe except it looks like it‚Äôs on a platform with how much padding is on the base of the shoe. 

Inner sides of my feet hang over the side of the shoe base. This is not the move and my foot feels very likely to roll while walking or running in these shoes.

2) the amount of area you can lace up is less compared to the Bondi 8, and the laces and lace holes feel cheaper compared to my Bondi 8‚Äôs. They also can‚Äôt lace as high up as the 8‚Äôs.

3)They took away pretty much all ankle support by making the ankle walls and padding shorter. The ankle wall in sub ankle at this point. And all upper foot support is gone.


This is a trash product and it took away all the things that made the Bondis great. This is my 6th pair and I am probably not going to buy anything from hoka at this point. ",2025-02-19 22:42:51+00:00,16,26

1iqvn82,Hoka,"Need Advice: Which Hoka Shoe Is Versatile Enough for Jumps, Sprints, Wrestling Drills, AND Working at a Hospital?","Hey everyone!  
I‚Äôm looking for a single pair of Hokas that can do it all:

* Small sprints and jumps (I do circuit-training style workouts)
* Some wrestling drills (so I need decent lateral support)
* Long hours of walking at my job (I work in a hospital, so I‚Äôm on my feet for 8‚Äì10 hours a day)

I‚Äôve checked out several Hoka models (Bondi, Clifton, Kawana, Tivra, etc.) but I‚Äôm a bit overwhelmed. I need solid cushioning for long shifts, but also decent stability and responsiveness for explosive exercises and sprints.

From what I‚Äôve read, the Kawana seems like a good all-rounder, but I‚Äôm still unsure. The Bondi SR looks perfect for work (lots of cushioning and slip-resistance), but I‚Äôm worried it might be too bulky for quick moves.

I received a pair of Bondi 8's in a size 10D (my normal size) as a gift for the holidays.  I've never worn Bondi's before, but have a few other styles of Hokas that I really enjoy.  

The weather was finally nice enough to go for a longer walk (7 miles) - and they felt nice to start, but by the end of it there was the start of blisters on the [inner side heel](https://i.imgur.com/bTC2NeX.png) of each foot.  Basically if you draw a line where the top of the insole sits at the side of your heel.

Is this a ""common"" thing with Bondi's?  Would a wide (I don't normally wear wide) suit me better?

1ikknz8,Hoka,Hoka clifton 9 (slow shoes?),"Hi! I just got the Clifton 9 two months ago as I just started running. They are my daily run shoes and raced a 10km with it already. As I train more with the shoes, they feel slow and bulky? Like I have to exert more effort per stride. 

Fore context:

I had 2 easy runs on a treadmill with the same speed (7km/h) and time (45 min). For the first easy run, I used the Clifton 9 and my zone 2 was 60% of the run and 40% zone 3. So it felt like a tempo run even if I was running with my easy pace of 8:00-8:30. 

As for my second run the next day, I used my old ultraboost 19 and my zone 2 was 85% of the run and 15% zone 3. The run felt like a true easy run as compared to when I used the hokas even if I used the same speed and time on the same treadmill.

I‚Äôve been trying to find a way to send detailed product feedback to HOKA, but I‚Äôm coming up short. All I can find on their site are channels focused on FAQs, order tracking, shipping info, returns/exchanges, and warranty claims.

I don‚Äôt see any option for sharing feedback about their products directly‚Äîjust the typical processes for orders, returns, and warranties.

I want to share some thoughts about my recent experience with their Ora Recovery Slide 3 compared to their older models (Ora 1s and Primos), and I‚Äôd prefer to give my input directly rather than through a generic review.

I tried the speed goats which had excellent grip in the mud but after each run my knee hurt, they definitely didn‚Äôt feel as cushioned so I think this was causing my knee pain. 

I think my only other options are the challenger  and the Stinson but it looks like the challenger isn‚Äôt as plush or supported as the bondi and the Stinson is a stable shoe and the bondi is a neutral shoe so may cause me issues?

1i9zhqe,Hoka,New Hokas Don't Feel Right,"I need some help.

I have AWFUL plantar faciitis and I went a couple of years barely being able to walk until my podiatrist told me to get some HOKAS. I got the Bondi 8 in wide and they have been life changing! My feet don't hurt anymore, I can move faster, and everything has been all around better. 

My only issue is that they are not waterproof and I can't find anything that is that has the same support. So now it's time to replace them and I researched all of HOKA shoes and found the Transport Chukka GTX had waterproof options and looked like what I was looking for. So I ordered a pair from HOKA. I like that they have a Fly for 30 program so I can try them out for 30 days and return them if they don't work.

Well I've given them a week and I just don't know. They don't feel like they have the same arch support and even though they did not have the wide option ( I ordered an 8 again) they feel loose. I'm also not a fan of the elastic shoe strings. They came with regular laces but I can't figure out how to remove the elastic ones without cutting them entirely. I usually wear a 7.5 but because my foot is wide I will size up for a better fit. 

I am considering sending them back and just getting a Bondi 9 but they still don't have those in waterproof. The Bondi SR has a water resistant option, but I'm not sure how they compare to the Bondi 8 or 9.

So 1. Does anyone know how to remove the stretchy laces without cutting them

And 2. Does anyone have a lot of experience with HOKAS that can help me figure out if I am just getting the wrong style? I do have a high arch and I am very overweight so the extra cushion in the Bondis has been phenomenal. I do not wear orthotics.

What I'm wondering is whether people think it's worth me buying shoes for overpronation when only one foot needs this support (the other 'healthy' foot is neutral or possibly even underpronated), or choosing something in between and using orthotics?

I don't live anywhere near any stockists so unfortunately I can't try shoes before I buy.

Bondi 9 came out 5 days ago so I thought I would try to help other people that don't have retail locations that stock 'wide' to try on. The width difference is enormous.  Its like going from Hokas to Nikes. I have both of them, gaviota 5, and Bondi 9 EXTRA wide in my hands right now so im not imagining it.

In 'US mens 12 wide' for both shoes the ""8"" was 5/16 of an inch wider than the ""9"" at its widest point.

The US mens 12 wide Gaviota 5 is 1/16th of an inch wider than the EXTRA WIDE bondi 9.

Buyer be warned

I am looking for an Allrounder, which I can wear in like Columbia for a whole month for hiking, running and city trips. I only want to bring one pair of shoes and maybe a pair of flip flips with me.

So far I have tried the Arahi, Mach 6 and speedgoat 6 and I wear them all in the ""wide"" version.

As i want some shoes I can wear with every weather condition I am looking for some gore tex. 

And with wide and gore tex the only options from hoka are the speedgoat 6 and the anacapa 2.

- NB 1080v13: loved them but in the end too squishy and the plantar heal pain worsened 
- NB More v5: Recently tried but are massive. Love the squish but again too much I think 
- HOKA Mach 5: Liked this but support was not good and a likely cause of my plantar 
- HOKA Clifton 9: Loved the thought of getting on with them but couldn‚Äôt. Felt like i was running in sand 
- HOKA Bondi 8: again wanted to like them but were too big and firm for a ‚Äòcushioned‚Äô shoe
- ON Monsters: Tried a few runs in them but for a shoe to claim it‚Äôs like walking on clouds and it‚Äôs like running with planks of wood on your feet, is quite ironic m
- Brooks Adrenaline 23: Thought would be good for plantar but way too firm for me. 
- Brooks Ghost Max: Tried, couldn‚Äôt get on with them 
 ASICS Novablast 3: At first liked them but didn‚Äôt quite fit right 
- Puma Mag Max: my other shoe in rotation at the moment and can‚Äôt complain about it. Well the only fault is the heel collar collapsed when putting one shoe on, which was annoying 

Have tried various Nike pegs and too firm.

Anyway did a 5K in these tonight and first impressions were pretty good!

- TTS: purchased in UK10 (wide) 
- UK10/10.5 in normal fitting were too big/ small so I‚Äôd advise going for the wider fit 
- Run was smooth, transitions felt nice, rocker was good for my feet. 
- Not the most exiting ride or bounce like with the NB cushion 
- Better than the Bondi 8 and don‚Äôt feel like a brick 
- Style/ colour way looks good 

The only thing to note, and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me but my big toe does feel like it rubbed up against the upper quite a bit, in a way that may blister over time. But hopefully as I wear them in this should begin to wear better.

Overall happy with them and seems like a good upgrade to me (that said it‚Äôs early days and after a measly 5K post work run!) ",2025-01-15 21:31:26+00:00,21,14

1i0myft,Hoka,Warranty Department is a joke,"After calling Hoka for the third time, I finally received an update on my warranty return. Hoka had my shoes for almost a month and I had heard nothing from them during that time. Each time I received an update it was because I called and the only information I received was ""they have it and they will reach out"". I had owned my Bondi 8's for no more then 8 months before the fabric began to separate from the sole. It is very clear that it is not a tear or rip and that the glue used to bond the fabric to the sole had failed. 

  
To rub salt in the wound, Hoka has chosen to make it impossible for customers to speak and or dispute claims with the warranty department. Their own employees and management can not either. Talk about terrible and shady business practices. 

Paying 165.00 for a pair of shoes and to have them fail within a year and then be denied is absurd. It's mind boggling seeing all these paid ads and influencers touting the brand only to finally see them for what they are.

Its a shame, I REALLY liked the Bondi 8's. Very comfortable and helped with my foot pain. It's sad that after being treated this way I wont be buying another pair. I hope that my experience can shed some light on the other side of Hoka and what one can expect from them.",2025-01-13 19:56:45+00:00,2,8

1hzq6gj,Hoka,Bondi 9 vs. Clifton 10 vs. Skyflow: Need advice for my next pair!,"**Hi fellow runners,**

It‚Äôs time to retire my Bondi 8s, and I‚Äôm considering what to get next. Since the Bondi 9 and Clifton 10 are coming out soon, I‚Äôm torn between the two.

The Bondi 9 seems like the natural choice since I‚Äôve loved the Bondi 8, but I‚Äôm also tempted by the Clifton 10. At 55 years old and weighing 94kg (207 lbs), I‚Äôm thinking the lighter Clifton might be a good option‚Äîespecially now that it also has an 8mm drop, which I‚Äôve heard could make things easier on my feet.

Although I don't need a stability shoe, the wide base of the Bondis provides some stability, which works well for me, and I‚Äôm not sure if the Clifton will offer the same.

While browsing, I stumbled upon a model I wasn‚Äôt familiar with: the *Skyflow*. Does anyone here have experience with them? How do they compare to the Bondi or Clifton? I‚Äôm hesitant to take a risk since where I live, there‚Äôs no option to exchange or try before buying.

Coming from the Bondi 8, would it be best to stick with the Bondi 9, or should I try the Clifton 10‚Äîor even give the Skyflow a shot? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts and experiences to help me decide.

1hza0ar,Hoka,Hoka Transport - Ball Foot Pain,"Review of Hoka Transport (Regular, Non-Goretex) After a 2-Month Asia Trip

Fit: I sized up for my pair of Hoka Transport, opting for the regular version instead of the Goretex model.

Overall Performance:
	‚Ä¢	Comfort: These shoes provided solid comfort and support throughout my trip.
	‚Ä¢	Support: The ankle and midsole support were excellent, with sufficient bounce to keep me energized during long walks.
	‚Ä¢	Protection: The design was protective enough to prevent back pain, which is often an issue for me during extended wear.

Challenges:
While my left foot felt fine, my right foot developed severe pain in the ball of the foot, near the area adjacent to the second toe. Unfortunately, this pain has persisted even a month after I stopped wearing the Hokas. It‚Äôs called Metatarsalgia

Solutions Tried:
	‚Ä¢	Switching to thick wool or cotton socks helped alleviate some of the discomfort in my right foot.
	‚Ä¢	Alternating with a different pair of sneakers also made a noticeable difference.

Pain is called Metatarsalgia defined as: (met-uh-tahr-SAL-juh) is a condition in which the ball of your foot becomes painful and inflamed. You might develop it if you participate in activities that involve running and jumping. There are other causes as well, including foot deformities and shoes that are too tight or too loose.rr",2025-01-12 00:16:39+00:00,2,3

I do care about durability. I vacation 2-3 times a year and usually city walk around 8 miles a day. I only like to have one pair of shoe when I travel.

Other than hoka, I‚Äôm open to other suggestions. Things that matter:

-	Breathable (as much as possible with water resistant shoes)
-	Durable
-	Comfy for walking from morning to night all over a city
-	Black or black and white
-	Shoes, not boots. Shoes that can go with anything
-	No more than $200",2025-01-02 17:14:38+00:00,4,11
1hrrdz3,Hoka,Best model for flat feet ,"Hello folks!

I have been running in Clifton 9 for over two years (runner from 10y) and preferred Hoka over Brooks, Adidas etc. I recently found out that I have flat feet (I know it‚Äôs weird at 36). I am 162 cm for 51 kg, which Hoka would you recommend? 

I tried in shop ASICS GT and Saucony Guide but the support felt painful! I would not like to abandon Hoka :(

Thank you :))",2025-01-02 11:08:22+00:00,3,6
1hrq7uy,Hoka,"Clifton 9, knee pain even after 2 months of wearing","I‚Äôve been a long time vans and converse wearer, never thought too much about shoes because I didnt walk more than 1 hour without break.

My lifestyle changed and I‚Äôm walking at least 1.5 hours now - not often, but every 3 days or so. On other days, I‚Äôm working from home and would do house chores on my feet.

All to say, the tougher soles and cramped toe box of my old shoes gave me the motivation to buy a pair of Clifton 9. I‚Äôve not worn a pair of sport shoes for almost 10 years until this one. Loved it. But after these long walks, its inevitable that my left knee will feel very tender when bending and straightening. I thought maybe its just because I need time to get used to them, it has been a little over 2 months now and I‚Äôm still getting this.

From what I can find, this is likely called runner‚Äôs knee or IT band syndrome. I‚Äôm hoping some of these exercises suggested online would help, otherwise I might need to shelf them and go back to converse.

If anyone experienced or experiencing this similar feeling, please share how youre dealing with it.",2025-01-02 09:43:03+00:00,1,5

1hqcazc,Hoka,Bondi SR for Outdoor Work,"I work maintenance for an apartment complex, and I have been wearing the same pair of Bondi X for 3 years. Started out in Texas, and for the last year I've been in high desert central Oregon. They've got holes and wear, the yellow has darkened, and the soles are nearly exposing the carbon fiber plate because I ran across hot coals a couple months back (the fact they're still going is a testament to their quality).

I just ordered another pair from Nordstrom Rack, but as it's discontinued in favor of the Skyward X I may not have that option again after another year. I have issues with my toes, and the only shoe that has ever been comfortable has been the Bondi X. But now I'm hoping to venture into something longer lasting on a professional level, more suited to wet conditions, and safer for stairs. The tail on the bondi X takes a special kind of awareness that eventually becomes second nature, but it's still easy to clip your heel and pull the sole away from the shoe working on stairwells, and can be dangerous when carrying heavy loads.

I also picked up a pair of Kaha 2 GTX boots for the upcoming snow season, and hope for those to last me into summer hikes at the river and some creeks. So I don't have to worry about trying to fit my cleats over the long Bondi X, or even the SR.

But I have a few questions about the SR. Generally, how do the Bondi SR kicks perform in an outdoor, mostly concrete, some dirt/crushed rock environment? What about a rainy outdoor environment? How long do they typically last, compared to your average Hoka runners? Finally, would you even recommend them for outdoor work?",2024-12-31 10:48:42+00:00,2,6

Advice needed on what shoes would be the best for me & how Hokas define themselves.
I don't need anything overly specialized, just a pair of shoes to walk around in, endgoal: Disneyland, etc. For now, I am mainly just doing chores around the house & short, occasional shopping trips.
I am recovering from a couple broken feet and ankles due to supination (feet rolled inward while going down stairs). 

I like the ""stable"" look but it is for the opposite problem that I have. I'd like a wide bottom to help with stability when I walk. For this the Gaviotas look good.

Would ""professional use"" shoes, like the Bondi be ok for general standing around and walking around?  I'm looking for comfort, safety & confidence while walking.

I bought a pair of those, I bought a pair of Nike Air Monarchs (my previous favorite) - they're all garbage now - the soles are flat and hard and offer no support.

I finally broke down when Costco had a sale on the Clifton 9's for $100 last week and I just put them on.  The very first step I took I was like ""oh WOW - these are DIFFERENT.""

1h7dyzg,Hoka,Comparison: Clifton vs Bondi ,"Hi everyone! I‚Äôm back. So, as some of you may remember, I had concerns with the Clifton 9s in terms of size. I sized down a 1/2 size for a 7 in Clifton 9s and they‚Äôre perfect. The sole is springy, foot placement feels right, I can run hurdles, jog, sprint, do multiple set of A Skips, B Skips and C Skips and am movin‚Äô and groovin‚Äô! Love the Clifton 9s that I‚Äôve had for about a month now.

I found a deal for the Bondi 8s, and bought a pair. I had to go with my normal size with these 7.5 women. First impression: much firmer than the Clifton 9s, heavier, lots of cushion on the outer edge which feels strange. The outer sole cushion almost makes it feel like it‚Äôs trapping my foot to prevent it from rolling outward. I don‚Äôt have problems with rolling my feet, so I would say this is a feature I‚Äôm not particularly fond of. I able to bounce and hop in these, and job, but it‚Äôs not as comfortable. Definitely a firmer landing. The Clifton 9 design almost encourages your foot to rock forward, like it‚Äôs preparing you to just go. The Bondi feels a bit more flat, not feeling the rock.

They‚Äôre both great, but I imagine the Bondi pair I just purchased will be my first and last.  I am thoroughly enjoying the Clifton much better!

Feel free to ask any questions or share your thoughts! üíö

I currently wear my current pair of shoes with no socks usually and they just slip on, which I love because I hate wearing socks.  I would like a shoe that just slips on and is comfortable for walking and also somewhat stylish.  I saw the transports and I tried on the white and eggnog.  Both looked really nice and felt comfortable but figured I would take some time to think about it.  I am not sure if the all white would be hard to keep clean so the eggnog color might be easier?  Anyone own these shoes?  If so, thoughts?  Also, what color do you have?  

Any information or advice would be great!  Thank you!

1gsr2n6,Hoka,My impression of Hoka Bondi 8 with ankle arthritis.,"I bought this pair of shoes for a family member. I did some research on how to choose shoes for ankle arthritis, focusing on features like cushioning, soles, stability, and whether the person has flat feet.   
  
Some shoes are designed specifically for stability, but since my family member doesn‚Äôt have flat feet, the Bondi seemed like the closest option for purchase.

But It turns out this pair of Hoka Bondi 8 is a very stiff shoes as they use stiff foams and materials all over the shoes. For ankle arthritis or osteoarthritis, the stiff collar makes ankle swelling worse compared to soft-collar shoes. This makes the shoes even more painful after walking a shorter-than-normal distance. The Bondi shoes are so stiff in the collar, they feel like a shackle, to the point of being unbearable.

I suspect the factories making the Bondi have been using very cheap foams for a long time. The total materials cost is very possibly less than $10 per shoe. This is the reason in some regions a pair of Bondi can be sold as low as $30. If you are picking a pair of shoes to deal with ankle arthritis, then pick one with a soft collar. And Bondi failed hard to do so. 

I would also like to hear if anyone here has experience with both the Bondi and ankle arthritis. In my opinion, the Bondi is an absolutely terrible pair of shoes because of how stiff it is on the ankle. ",2024-11-16 16:34:41+00:00,1,18

So I've read some tests/reviews on runrepeat.com and they were impressed about the overall durability of the Clifton LS.

1furvrs,Hoka,Shoe Model Advice,"Since 2020 I have been ordering the Bondi model. It has a lot of cushion which has made it so I can run with a bad back (two bulged discs). The problem I've had with them is that they start to hurt the side of my feet. The pain is around the end of the 5th metatarsals on the skin and is due to the development of corns on the skin. I went with 2E shoes and that seemed to help, but still caused some pain to my corns. However, on the last two pairs I've gotten, I've tried 4E and have no problems whatsoever. 

Here's the issue I have. 4Es are hard to come by at a brick-and-mortar store, and I just won a pair of Hokas from my local outdoor store. I know for sure they do not have 4E Bondi and are unlikely to order them. My question for the group is can I do anything with a 2E that will make it so it doesn't hurt the side of my foot? Also, are there any other Hokas that offer the same amount of cushion as the Bondi but are more accommodating to wider feet without having to get the 4E?

I tried out the Mach6 during a Hoka social run after being on the edge for actually buying them. I liked the shoe (just disappointed you would not have wide‚Äôs for your events Hoka üòí)

1fkxsyn,Hoka,Looking for best Running Shoes for wide feet (Extra Wide?),"
Hello everyone! Kind of a beginner here. 
I currently own Nike Pegasus in 10.5 ‚ÄúExtra Wide‚Äù.
So far this is the only shoe that fit me without hurting on my runs. I am due for a replacement so I looked around online and gravitated toward Hokas.

Ended up buying Hoka Clifton 9s in 10.5 ‚ÄúWide‚Äù and went for a run. Mid foot was sore afterwards only after 3 miles. 

Are Nike‚Äôs ‚ÄúExtra Wide‚Äù Measurement 4E or 2E? Did I get a shoe that is not wide enough for my foot? Was thinking of re lacing to accommodate space but I feel that is just a temporary fix. Is this normal? Need some advice before I utilize Hoka‚Äôs return policy. 

Also any good running shoe recommendations that fit similar to Nike Pegasus 10.5 Extra Wides?

Had to half size up for comfort, even though my feet are quite narrow.

Two days into my holidays, 20k steps each day and I am out of action. 7 blisters in one foot, 3 blisters on another. I am in pain and disappointed. Spent my time researching for trainers which were supposed to be amazing and it has potentially made my holidays to Japan awkward. Not even sure if I am able to do the hikes I have planned.

Weather here is stupidly hot atm, which is the perfect blister environment but this Hoka pair is far from comfortable. My partner is spending all day with his cheap Superga and he is in a much better place than me.

When I had an MRI for said ripping, I found out there is arthritis in my feet as well. Ugh. 

I thought Hokas were a running/hiking shoe only, and thus of no use to me. Then my brother, sis-in-law, nephew, cousins, and several friends became Hoka converts. 95% of them are non-athletes like me. One cousin had been 'prescribed' Hokas by her orthopedist for arthritis in her feet. All of them raved about how comfy they were and now won't wear anything else. Hmm. Bought a pair of Clifton 9s from the Hoka site. Yes, they are pricey, but I'm willing to pay a little more for good quality and longevity.

Y'all. My heels feel cradled, for lack of a better word. I honestly feel like my feet are 'floating'. I was surprised how lightweight they are, given the thick soles. While they don't have actual ankle support, the width of the sole kinda stabilizes my feet. I went bonkers and bought 2 more pairs!

TL;DR: Hokas are awesome for everyday walking and aren't just for runners and hikers. 

My only complaint would be in the arch support. I have crazy high arches (pes cavus) and most shoes don't support them enough. These shoes do give more support than the usual sneaker, but I could use a little more support. Can anyone recommend an arch insert?

Well, I lost just about everything in a flood two weeks ago, including my house, my car, all my clothes including my scrubs, and my beloved new balance. I'm grateful to be surrounded by amazing community who came together to donate to those of us affected in droves. When I went to the community center to pick up some clothes and shoes, someone had donated what seems to be a brand new or damn close to it pair of Clifton 9's in my size. I was shocked to find the only women's size ten shoes there were these neon pink hokas. I would have never picked this color myself, but beggars certainly can't be choosers and any sturdy pair of work shoes is a huge huge blessing, so they went ""home"" with me, when I had no real home to go to.

When I tell y'all I'm OBSESSED with these things. I've never worn such a comfortable shoe. I've never felt so stable on my feet while also feeling so much cushion under them. I can work twelve hours in these and come home with no pain. Ive worn these bad boys while trying to salvage what I could from my house, worn them to work, worn them just about everywhere for the past two weeks because well, they're my only pair of shoes! I'm going to wear these ugly, ugly, radioactive pink shoes into the ground. I'm going to have them bury me in these shoes. I wish I knew who donated them, so I could hug them. I wish I knew why they donated new, very expensive shoes. Did they not fit? Were they a gift to someone who was just as appauled but the color as I am? Did some angel on earth buy these just to donate them?

1dqjnzb,Hoka,Sad and unfortunate experience with Hoka Ora Primo ,"Hi everyone,

I just ordered my first Hoka, and was happy to be able to gran the Hoka Ora Primo in my size EU 46. I picked them up today and was very frustrated to experience that it is impossible for me to put them on. 

The opening for my foot is too tight and won't let me slip into these shoes as easily as I would wish to. After like 20 minutes, I achieved to put 1 on without damaging the shoe. I have the feeling the shoe has not enough height for my foot and hence is tight around the opening even when on. 

I hope to have the possibility to get a 46 2/3 in order to try if this might solve the issue, as I really like the aesthetic of the shoe. If someone has a similar issue / size, please let me know how you solved the issue.

In case someone from Hoka reads this, it would be nice to consider making the opening a bit more stretchy, as the shoe fits in size, but the opening does not let me slip in. After some research, I found that I am actually not alone with this issue.

1dmja53,Hoka,Hoka Challenger 7 issues,"Hello everyone, 

I have an annoying problem with my recently purchased Hoka Challenger 7s and I don't know if it can be fixed, and how.

I'n an avid walker and go on long city or country walks and hikes in my spare time. I love in the EU. I am in my thirties and not a runner at all. I have a bit of a limp in my left leg after a disclosed knee several years ago, but it hasn't caused me any noticeable discomfort for a while now. I wanted al all-purpose walking sneaker that can handle well both in the city and on mild trails, and bought Hoka Challengers three months ago. My usual shoe size is 44, I have a relatively narrow foot with an enormous toe that tears most shoes apart within months. The shop recommended sizing up, so I bought size 45. It felt a little roomy but not uncomfortable. 44 felt painfully tight in the toe.

I decided to immediately test my purchase and went on a two-day 35 km hike across soft country trails, some hills, but also asphalt. My Challengers performed exceptionally well across all surfaces, I had no blisters or callouses after the trip. 

Turns out this was some sort of a miselading honeymoon phase. Now I keep having uncomfortable feeling in my left foot and even further up in the knee and hip. It feels likey left foot just isn't properly secured within the shoe: it slides, or rolls left and right and I keep thinking that I am not putting the foot down onto the surface properly. My right foot is absolutely fine, no discomfort whatsoever. I have never had such a massive difference in fit between two parts of the same pair. 

I tried lacing the shoes tighter, it didn't make any difference. Then I tried a couple different insoles - a soft, but thicker one from my older lower hiking boots, and an orthopedic insert. Both felt like taking too much space in the shoe, leaving the foot more cramped than before, and it felt like the padding of the extra insole interfered with the padding of the actual shoe sole.

I'm at a loss. I tried just powering through and having 5-6 km walks in the city with the original insoles or with some of my alternatives but it steel feels uncomfortable. I am now past my 30 days return window, and it's very frustrating. 

Did anyone have a similar experience? Is this a side effect of the Hoka concept or the Challenger model? Or did I just buy a size too large and if 44s didn't fit, I shouldn't have bought Hokas at all? Could it be that my (not very pronounced) limp somehow wore out the left shoe causing this problem? Visually the left and right shoe looks exactly the same bad the wearing of the tracks is minimal.

Any advice is welcome.",2024-06-23 10:34:03+00:00,2,2

1dhwbzu,Hoka,Hoka Online Purchases - Customer service rant,"I purchased a pair of my first Hoka's online recently. Delivery took longer than expected and arrived about a week later, but I had left for a holiday. No worries, got back and tried them on to discover they were way too narrow and painful. Now, I wanted a pair of Hokas and though it's never been an issue before, clearly I'd need the wide version of their shoe. I should have just sent them back for a refund and ordered a different pair, but instead I foolishly contacted their customer service. I emailed them on a Thursday at midday, got a response the following Thursday morning. I replied immediately, got a response the next Thursday morning. 

Obviously they've got an a requirement on their customer services to respond within a week... so they don't reply for a week. I managed to get 2 replies in 14 days and by the time I got the second response, (despite having sent chaser emails throughout), they told me it was too late to be returning them - it wouldn't have been if they'd just replied within 2 or 3 days of my basic query on how to go about getting a different pair. 

The whole experience has been enough of a downer I'm not just going to have to sell the pair I've received at a  loss for an hour of indoor wear and the whole thing has left me so sour I'm looking at alternative shoes instead. 

Moral of the story, companies, if you only measure a customer services team by replying to all queries within 7 days, eventually, they only bother looking at customer queries once six days have passed. ",2024-06-17 12:00:38+00:00,2,4

Love these shoes but not sure I can buy new set every 6months. Perhaps I need a less foamy sole due to my leg length difference situation.

I'm guessing its just a bit of a manufacturing difference around the insole. I've found that wearing a slightly thicker pair of sports socks seems to offset the problem, but the ones I have are cheap and not made for running so I'm hoping that some purpose designed ones may rectify this issue for me - does anyone have any advice on which socks work best for this particular issue?

In the last year I've done around 620 km in Clifton 9s before switching to the Adidas Ultraboost Light. I thought the Cliftons had a bit of a ""boring"" ride when I first stared, but then with time I grew to like them more. The Ultraboost Lights on the other hand I quite dislike. Even after 100 km I just can't get used to them and after every run (even if it's 5 km) my legs are tired as if I wore ankle weights.

In the future I plan on doing up to half-marathon distance runs (21 km), at a pace around 6 min/km (maybe down to 5:30 min/km, but I highly doubt it will be faster than that). But I think the majority of my runs would be easy with a distance around 10 km. I also have a high arch (supination).

What are your suggestions - should I play it safe and get another pair of Cliftons or would some other models fit the criteria? I've done some research on the Mach model, but i'm not sure if there will be any benefits at my pace.

1cf555y,Hoka,Clifton 9 GTX: Half Size Up Any Wider?,"Just got my 1st pair of Hokas, and really want them to work out, but found that my normal 12 size is a bit tight for my comfort.  Since they don't come in wide sizes, would moving up 1/2 size provide any more width?
With the tongue sewn in, it is what it is, and taking the laces out altogether is the only available way to try and eke out any additional room.  Failing an extra half step up providing more width, I'll have to look elsewhere.

I have been wearing my Hoka Gaviota (wides) 4s for about a year and I swear by them as the best shoes I've ever worn.

He is interested in getting a pair but he is very stubborn and he's intimidated by the designs and styles Hoka offers. (Obviously some of the styles look almost alien/otherworldly especially the newer ones.) Dicks is building a store in his town but I'm afraid his options will only be the new crazy style shoes geared towards young college kids who want the wild-style appearance.
 
Is there an alternative line for him to select from in the more subdued, simple yet effective, function over form, ""basic"" type shoes Hoka offers or is it a 'online only' type of shopping experience?

1cb4eyy,Hoka,Terrible experience of Hoka in the UK,"I have had possibly the worst customer experience of my life with Hoka. 

I recently bought some new gym shoes from the company which quickly started to fall apart. They were lightly used, only in gym classes for a few weeks. Having gone back and forth with customer services providing proof of purchase etc.they agreed to take the shoes back to inspect. 

I had bought the shoes on sale, and was hoping to quickly resolve the problem as it was clear that the deterioration was not normal wear and tear. The shoes were now nearly 50% more expensive than when I bought them. I shipped the shoes back and was:
- given an incomplete refund (despite the website showing free shipping and returns, the warranty claim being accepted as abnormal deterioration) 
- the shoes were in stock on the website in the correct size

I then contacted support again and despite the 48% difference in price, I was offered a 10% off voucher along with a partial refund for a product I don't have. 

Hoka, all I want is the same model of shoes I ordered, that you have in stock.

I would absolutely not recommend buying direct from this company until they can sort their customer experience out, buy from a retailer if you must buy their shoes. ",2024-04-23 13:17:55+00:00,4,1

It arrives on 05 April. Wrong size. 

I contact chat and they email me a pdf label for a return for the correct size.

I return the package using the label they had me print.

Hoka ships me the 2nd shoe on 11 April. I look at the email and it is the SAME SIZE as the last one. As in they sent me the incorrectly sized shoe for the second time. 

I contact chat and they tell me that there isn't anything they can do. I have two options: 1) Call Chat again and see if they can stop the package enroute and have it returned for a refund. or 2) Wait for the package to arrive and return it for a refund. Apparently there is no third option to Exchange the item again because of some system/processing rule. 

I'd order from Amazon but I'm worried about fakes. I'd order from Zappos but they don't have the color/size I want. I'd buy it locally but they don't have it either. The ONLY option is to trust Hoka to send me the shoe I ordered. 

I like Hoka Bondis but their shipping department is absolutely horrible. There is no way to escalate a concern either, you are stuck with a Tier 1 chat agent.

1bse5mt,Hoka,Clifton‚Äôs - what is different,"Started running in May. 
HOKA Challengers several pairs and rotated.
Got the HOKA Rocket X2 for races (LOVE everything about these shoes). 
Next up tried the HOKA Carbon X3. While they didn‚Äôt feel how I was expecting them to, they actually have seemed to work well for me especially how my feet feel late in long runs. 

Now, I rotated out all of my Challengers and decided to try the Clifton‚Äôs. The midsole seems to be slightly higher than the other models. The soles are softer too. But I can‚Äôt run more than 10 miles without developing some sort of problem. My hips are sore. My posterior tibial is sore. My Achilles is sore. Once I hit 10-12 miles everything crashes very fast and I have to stop running.  

Because I rotate shoes training it‚Äôs taken me a bit to realize I think it‚Äôs the shoes. I‚Äôm also late in marathon training and initially thought it was the high volume this month. But I think it‚Äôs the shoes. 

My question for those that know more about HOKAs, what specifically is different with the Clifton‚Äôs compared to the other 3 models that may have caused this? Did they change my gate that is causing the hip discomfort/pain that is cascading down to my ankles and feet? Is it the midsole doing this? What can I look out for in future shoes? 

Just trying to understand what is so different and why these problems crept up. I have high arches and pronate slightly. Logged 4 months of 40-55 mile weeks without any pain in the challengers and carbon X3s. ",2024-03-31 16:15:34+00:00,2,0

I've got a new pair of Hoka Transport (M) and while I'm very happy with their comfort when I tried them on indoors, I'm a bit confused/disappointed after some walks outdoors. 

My shoes make a very annoying plopping sound when lifting my heel of the back foot to the next step. For what I hear the sound doesn't come from the outsole. I already tried to lace them tighter or more loosely, but the sound remains. 

Any idea what's causing this and if it will go away?

1bbnc9s,Hoka,Crazy sizing,"I wondered what is going on with Hoka sizing - it is very frustrating. It seems to me like they have decided on their own sizing system instead of being uniform with the rest of the planet and other running shoes. It's a complete stab in the dark what is going to work, especially with the options of widths. It seems to be generally understood that you go one entire size up - but why do they keep consistent with this?

\- It wastes store colleagues time having to explain to every single customer go up a size

\- It's terrible for the environment, as I'm sure a high proportion of their shoes have to be returned and sent out again with the correct size. Also a waste of production materials in ones that cannot be resold.

\- Frustrates customers buying online who waste a week or so returning and getting new ones sent out

Why why would they do this!? I equally find the widths incredibly odd. All Hoka shoes seem insanely narrow for me on the ball of the foot and my feet are not wide, but a D wide shoe is too wide elsewhere and has terrible heel slippage.

I'm normally a size 6.5-7 in a running shoe, but don't seem to be anything that fits in Hoka. Closest I can get is a 7.5 or 7 wide. It's such a shame as I can tell they're great walking shoes, which is what I would like them for.

As stated in the tittle I'm a tall ex-football player and consequently a heavier guy (~ 110kg/220 pounds) looking for some running shoes - a pair for pavement only and a pair for trail running only. My whole family has been thrilled with Hokas so I decided to try a pair or two myself. The issue arrises when trying to figure which model would be the most suitable since there's tons of them at Hoka. I haven't really had any knee (or any other joint) related issue yet, but I would like to avoid any in the future and since running is quite heavy on the joints I would like to find a pair of shoes with proper cushioning, especially for a heavier person like me.

I had a chance to try the latest Cliftons which I liked a lot, but I found the Speedgoats to be a bit uncomfortable in the front due to the additional layer protecting the toes.

Now kind Hoka reddit community, would anyone have any other suggestions which model to also try? One last thing I have to mention is that I am a casual runner and I am not looking to compete and I have a neutral foot (not a pronator or supinator).
