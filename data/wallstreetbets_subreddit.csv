If the currency gets stuffed via interest/inflation etc, which seems increasingly possible, these companies are basically going to get their debt drastically reduced if there terms are fixed, like on the flip side companies that hold massive USD bond/cash reserves will lose a chuck of coin.

Its a loose theory but might be worth looking at if stock picking, but not something to bet your grandma's inheritance on.

- (positions in hkd)","so follow up to the earlier post, hong kong and china markets are pushing up again today but the move is still being held together by intervention, not clean demand. hsi around 2.5% with tech names leading. hsi tech index gained close to 3%. csi300 about 0.6% and the shanghai comp  around 0.9% But,  the structure hasn’t really changed. behind the move is a quiet restriction from regulators. desks are saying mainland brokers were told to cap net daily selling at 50 million yuan per fund or large retail account. nothing posted publicly but it’s being enforced. broker desks have already warned accounts. if you break it, you get watched or restricted. this is not a free market bounce.

state backed funds like huijin are also active again. buybacks are being pushed. brokerages told to keep the market stable. it’s coordinated. that’s why there’s support, not because money is flowing back in naturally. so thought we had some some relief after the us paused tariffs on phones, laptops and other electronics, covering about 20 categories. that gave tech some breathing room. apple suppliers in taiwan like foxconn and quanta jumped. but trump already said chips are next and even hinted phones might still get hit. pretty sure csi semiconductors index dropped like 1% after that. market reaction is still headline driven, not trend forming.

even with all that, hong kong equities still have room. most of the names mentioned earlier have moved, but some setups still have legs if hsi holds. byd electronic (285) (as people confuse it with byd 1211)  already pushed higher and looks like it could extend. xiaomi has started to tick up with still space to follow. lenovo broke early and is still holding. the bounce isn’t clean but it’s not done either. tradeable, not holdable. structure is intact for now.",2025-04-14 03:26:48+00:00,11,10

1jyoyk6,wallstreetbets,[Leveraged Forex] Betting on the Euro to replace the USD as the world's reserve currency,"[<Imgur link to position>](https://imgur.com/a/C3pBD94)

Ignore the long USD short yuan position, I was bullish the differential between the two until recently, and it'll be gone for more USD.EUR after China reports export data in 5 minutes. I'll probably settle somewhere between 200k to 250k EUR.

Over the last few days, I've started to actually believe that mango man actually believes in his stupid tariff nonsense, which has dramatically changed my outlook on the US economy. Let's lay out the current market situation;

- Treasury yields are spiking despite a huge increase in recession risk
- The dollar is shitting the bed, especially against the euro

There are a variety of reasons people have proposed, like this being a ""treasury attack"" by a sovereign nation. Anyone who tells you this is a ""treasury attack"" is braindead, but hedge funds being told to lay off the basis trades might actually be contributing to the volatility. Anyways, my personal thesis for why treasury yields are going up is simple:

**The market is pricing in that Trump is actually serious about implementing his agenda.** 

Let's look at the facts;

- Trump has infinitely doubled down on the tariff shit at this point. He's staffed the administrative branch and the legislative branch with true believers. He's amassed an extreme amount of economic and foreign policy power in his hands alone, with zero oversight. **If he wanted to actually press forward, he very much could.**
- He genuinely admires McKinley. This in and of itself isn't actually a bad thing, because he was actually a pretty decent president. The issue is that he's fucking LARPing as him and following his tariff playbook 1:1, when the economic situations are completely different. Back then, tariffs actually sorta worked to do what they wanted them to do. And therein lies the issue; **Trump might actually think he's doing the right thing.** Nothing more dangerous than an idealist who think they're doing right.
- Going back to the yields for a second, the US is on a totally unsustainable fiscal path. Spending is at 6.2% of GDP [\(FRED link\)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYFSGDA188S). That's fucking bonkers for the peacetime USA. And what does the fine president want to do? **Tax cuts.** Brother, what? But wait, there's more!
- **Trump has genuinely accepted he's going to hurt the economy in the short-term and has been building up the political capital to do just that.** Let me repeat that: the USA already has an insane deficit, *in good times*, so ***we're going to actively make things worse.***
- Last time they tried this, they created ~1800 jobs. **At a cost of $815,000 per job.** [Source: American Economic Association](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20190611). Good luck selling the US public on this.
- **The administration is jam packed with questionably sane ideologues.** I mean, Navarro, really? The living personification of ""Source? It came to me in a dream."" Holy shit man.
- **The US government has suffered one of the worst brain-drains a modern institution ever has in these last 3 months.** You can think what you want about excessive government, but going about it like this is a joke.

I'm gonna stop here, but you get the gist of it. His current and projected policy paths are genuinely insane when you get down to it. I was on the permabull train just out of raw inertia; I'm Canadian and investing in the USD and levered ETFs over the last 8 years has genuinely changed the trajectory my life. 

So, what's next? Who the fuck knows lmao, but I'm guessing the **Euro**.

It fulfills all the main conditions for a reserve currency: **Capability to run a deficit responsibly, political stability, capable institutions, depth of market/bond market, and no currency controls**. And we're seeing that recently, with a huge shift to EUR-denominated assets in the face of questionable sanity on the US side. I've personally seen enough, so I'm willing to bet on tariff man actually going through with all his shit.",2025-04-14 02:58:19+00:00,133,93

1jyfkuo,wallstreetbets,TSLA Q2 Deliveries,"Not interestd in long-term debates about viability but, short-term, this has got to be peak uncertainty about the company's future. Q2 delivery consensus has come down a bit but estimates north of 350k still scream 'general TSLA challenges' not refelcting a scenario where Q2 winds up being a complete crisis quarter.

  
Why couldn't Q2 deliveries potentially seize up and wind up coming in < 200k if only for one quarter? 

Q1 typically being weak, seasonality and other historical factors are of little value at this point in time as it seems like there has been a structural shift in the perception of TSLA that isn't going back anytime soon. In fact, so much has happened in such a short period of time that any projections based on YoY trends or growth rates seem antiquated to me. Looking Q1 25 as a baseline - Q2 2025 estimates that reflect an expectation of QoQ growth in units delivered seem aggressive to say the least when broken down regionally:

2025 Q1 Deliveries: 337k:

US 128k

China 79k

EU 63k

RoW approx. 67k with biggest shares from:

Canada 8k

SK/JPN 9k

AU/NZ 6k

Mid East/LATAM combine for 21k

The current 367k Q2 consensus reflects 17% expected YoY decline in deliveries and, holding regional sales mix constant from Q1, implies Q2 expected deliveries:

US 140k

China 86k

EU 69k

RoW 73k

Q1 deliveries were announced Apr 2, the morning of the 'recprocal' rate announcements. The quarter has just begun and the escalations in uncertainty that have taken place only very recently will impact TSLA for all of Q2 most likely. 

I'm having a tought time seeing US deliveries growing by 12k in Q2 vs the first three months of this year considering how quickly the brand has deteriorated...

Above all however, I see the biggest shock risk in the EU and China for Q2 deliveries. 

On Friday we saw TSLA announce a pause on taking orders on certain models in China. That can obviously be rescinded on a whim but, at the same time, can be expanded just as easily too. I think the tit-for-tat risk with China and US tariff escalation may have peaked but headline risk is still high on a day-to-day basis and, given TSLA's proximity to the administration, any new flare ups are likely to hurt TSLA directly. In fact, I would go as far to say China might be inclined to take actions specifically targetting TSLA and Musk if for no other reason than the perceived rift it could cause between Trump and Musk. For China in Q2, can we really say there isn't at least an elevated chance that all new orders and deliveries could be paused at least temporarily? 

At the same time, I cannot fathom how EU Q2 deliveries could show an increase of 6k vs. Q1. I think very soon (gut sense says this month) we will see the EU and China announce a deal on EVs opening up the Euro Zone market for BYD and others.. EU EV market share is already falling off of a cliff with sentiment towards the US and Musk in particular continuing to decline further. I really think a comprehensive EV deal between China and the EU could mark the start of the end of TSLA in Europe. 

Canada might be relatively small overall but Q1 Canadian deliveries were 8.6k - my understanding is a significant majority of those were sold during a particular weekend in January to take advantage of a government EV credit that has since expired. A lot has changed even since January as far as US/Canada relations - does anyone really expect any TSLAs to be delivered in Canada this quarter? 

I could see this being the kitchen sink quarter that gives Musk the cover to step away from DOGE as he's needed back at TSLA FT to oversee the 'robot transition'. Afterall, it's been about a year since he told everyone robo taxis were only a year or so away so it's time to come back and pump everyone up with more fantastical promised. I am bearish on TSLA fundamentals and think event contracts on Q2 deliveries might even be a decent way to hedge shenanigan risk on a stock short.

1jyc9iu,wallstreetbets,Inflation hedging strategies,"What will happen with inflation? I have no idea. Probably tariffs increase inflation but I have no idea by how much, or how the Fed will respond. But I want to play it safe. What do I do?

Initially I had a big chunk of VTIP. VTIP is one of the two main short-term inflation-protected bond ETFs, the other being STIP. VTIP actually has higher volume than STIP, somewhat unusually for a Vanguard ETF, which often don't top trade volume rankings. Good default choice.

But last week I sold my big chunk of VTIP and spent a smaller amount of money on VTIP calls instead. My main motivation was concerns about bond-market tail risk, but it also frees up capital for other things.  
  
Now VTIP options are *very* illiquid, but by placing a series of limit orders over 3 days I think I got decent execution. The price of the underlying moved against me in that time, resulting in an unrealized loss on the position, but I don't mind that—the point of the trade is to have a hedge for the future, not trade short-term price swings. Given the illiquidity, though, rolling them over to longer expiry could be gnarly—we'll see what happens with that.

https://preview.redd.it/rvsxxzjbumue1.png?width=2124&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ead91973a7ee68773456c869300c6cdffd9e08f

What other options are there? There's commodities, but those often imperfectly correlate with inflation. Then there's the big-boy hedge fund strategy of shorting regular treasuries while buying inflation-protected treasuries, but not all brokerages will let you do that and shorting treasuries can fuck you up if you're not careful.

Anything else anyone here does? Or does anyone want to speak up for commodities or the long-short treasuries trade?",2025-04-13 16:57:02+00:00,26,28
1jybkss,wallstreetbets,Could the exemption actually be bad for big tech,"Lutnick said today that the exemptions were done so that the exempted items could be included in the coming semiconductor tariffs (in the next month or two), and that the metric for this was so that those tariffs would not be negotiable because they are important for national security. And that this same situation applies to pharmaceuticals.

To me this sounds like he is saying everything not exempted (the stuff still tariffed at 145%) is negotiable, but semiconductors and pharmaceuticals won’t be negotiable when their new tariffs come.

Like the rest of the world I think Monday will be big green for AAPL, NVDA, etc.  and that the rising tide will probably lift all ships, but in the long run this actually sounds like really bad news for big tech.  There is practically no chance to manufacture those things in the US anytime soon or for a reasonable price and if these tariffs are truly non-negotiable these companies longer term outlook may be very bad.

1jy8hir,wallstreetbets,China asymmetric elevating response,"We won't see the impact of the China tarrifs kicking in for a few weeks because of some carve outs in the executive orders. Goods under $800 and sent via international Post don't have tarrifs kicking in until May 2 and good via ship are exempt if there were loaded or in transit this last week and reach there destition port by May 27. 

During the intervening time, China and others will continue to turn the screws on the bond market but not constantly. They don't want to bust the world, just Trump's ploy. 

We have seen China use direct and indirect asymmetric tactics repeatedly in the pastto achieve a benefit for them. We've all heard the winning about prices and shortages.

Tarrifs aren't paid until...after the containers have been unloaded. Containers are impounded until tarrifs are paid. If they aren't paid, containers aren't returned. Instead they continue to be impounded at the port for 15 days before fees kick and it can be declared abandoned.

Porta are big places but not limitless and we have seenultiple intensteats of ports effectly shut down because there are too many containers at the port and not enough room to unload.

What if China direct Chinese companies and offers compensation for them to continue or increase their shipments purposely slow ball or not pay tarrifs on containers at US ports. Essentially choking ports from being able to accept goods from other countries which in turns causes shortages and increased inflation. 

The knock on effects from this would be felt globally as shipping container rates would skyrocket again but it's the compounded impact on the US that China is selling.

ports choked and sky rocketing container rates = less gold available for consumers. US get a lot of everydays good imported via ship. The cunmliative result is US consumer pay higher prices and we see shortages
...again.


Most people don't understand where there goods are coming from so they will blame the companies and politicians. Alot of folks will blame Trump because timing lines up with tarrifs. End result more pain focused on US with less risking of a global recession from a bond market collapse to get Trump to back down.

Don't get me wrong the strategic meddling going on in the bond market could cause  global recession, if not controlled correctly or superceding event escalate the problem.

Could be absolutely wrong, but China ain't raising more tarrifs, going to be carefully meddling with bond market, but will also want this trade war to end on its terms, so this could be one avenue they pursue.

The dopamine from trading? Sure, that’s there. But what really drives it is something deeper: shame. Control. A need to rewrite the old story.

When I finally took a break, I felt something I hadn’t in a long time: I had *my mind* back. I remembered how much I liked games, my work, music, stuff I actually care about. But then I got pulled back in. Bad trades. Emotional chaos. And now I’m seeing the pattern.

1jxn9fb,wallstreetbets,Learning to let go of revenge trading—it's changed everything for me,"There was a time when missing a big move or taking a small loss would send me spiraling. I’d chase price, force trades that had no business being taken, and end up doing way more damage than the original loss ever could.

Revenge trading used to feel like a way to ""get back"" at the market. In reality, it was just me trying to soothe my ego with impulsive decisions. And unsurprisingly, that never worked out well.

But over time—through a lot of journaling, screen time, and mindset work—I started to realize something: missing a move or being wrong isn’t failure. It’s part of the process. The real failure was letting one small emotional reaction lead to a series of bad trades.

What helped me most was simply walking away. If a setup doesn’t play out the way I envisioned, I step back. Breathe. Go outside. Nap. Whatever it takes to reset. That one pause has probably saved me more money than any entry signal ever has.

Now, I see discipline as the win. Missing a move doesn’t feel like a loss anymore—it feels like I stayed in control. And every time I skip the revenge trade, it builds confidence. It's not about catching every move. It’s about catching the *right* ones, from the *right* mindset.

Anyone else make that shift? What helped you leave revenge trading behind?",2025-04-12 17:58:49+00:00,212,42

1jxlpvu,wallstreetbets,"I think there is still a huge downside risk for the US stock market, despite the exemption for electronics","So, recently the Trump admin made an exception for electronics (e.g. smartphones, computers, etc.), so I wouldn't be surprised if we see the Nasdaq and tech stocks jump next week. That being said, I don't think it's enough to prevent a long term downward decline for US stocks (or the US economy in general), because:

1) Tariffs on other non-electronic items, which are used by people on day to day basis (e.g. clothing, food, etc.) have not been lifted yet. This will definitely still impact smaller and medium sized businesses.

2) Rising bond yields as governments and investors outside of the US sell their US treasuries, which could pose a liquidity issue if no one wants to buy US bonds

3) The reports of declining consumer confidence in recent months. The US economy is consumption based, and if consumers reduce their spending, that will pose problems for the economy. 

4) At this point, I don't think it matters what the Federal Reserve does. If they turn on the money printer with quantitative easing, inflation will likely go up, which hurts the average consumer. If they increase interest rates, this will raise rates on mortgages, car loans, and other loans, which will hurt already cash strapped consumers. The problems being experienced are due to fiscal policies, not a monetary policies. The Fed won't save you.

5) Donald Trump's mercurial nature makes it difficult for business both inside and outside the US to plan for the future, since tariffs can go on and off with a tweet. As such, spending will likely slow down since the future is too uncertain. Businesses outside the US in particular may simply choose to open up shop in other countries with a more ""stable"" business environment.

Long story short, unless the tariffs Trump has implemented are greatly scaled back (and other countries do the same in response), and he stops making policy on a whim, the US stock market is still in for some hurt. Of course, this is just my opinion. What do you think?

(1) New tier of debt - force China to hold a second tier instrument of debt - consider issuing more complex debt tranches for the US treasuries in order to make it so no single debt holder (ie China) can tank the treasuries market and if they do it effects only their tranche of debt. Get that this devalues overall debt and credit worthiness if tranches have less liquidity but essentially rewrites the contract when a nation buys debt that they can’t tank it without hurting themselves more than the issuers broader economy

(2) multi lateral coordinated debt swaps and currency devaluation against the chinese yuan - rally all other countries to buy US debt in exchange for buying their debt and all major currencies printing more money (inflating) relative to the yuan

David D. Smith, the Executive Chairman of Sinclair Inc. ($SBGI), bought nearly \~$10M in shares of his own company, over doubling his position in just 30 days and accelerating over the past week.

What does the company do?

>American telecommunications conglomerate... second-largest television station operator in the United States by number of stations after Nexstar Media Group, owning or operating 193 stations across the country in over 100 markets, covering 40% of American households.... Sinclair owns four digital multicast networks, Comet, Charge!, The Nest, and TBD, and the sports-oriented cable network Tennis Channel. 

Shitty old news broadcasting business. Garbage, dying industry, so we're expecting to pay dirt cheap multiples.

And that's exactly what we get. The company trades at a PE of **2.8**, and **1.5x operating income, 5x EV/EBITDA.** You're basically buying the business for this year's and next year's earnings. The company does not have a healthy balance sheet, with debt outweighing tangible assets. However, since they're cash flow positive and have a genuine operating business, it's less of a concern, and they just refinanced their debt, showing there's confidence in the long term cash flows.

Deep value multiples set the stage for a massive margin of safety. But that's not what makes this stock interesting.

This guy's in Trump's pocket. He helped him get elected, twice, using his media platform to help the campaign. The Sinclair stations have a famously conservative tilt.

What's the catalyst? [Trump just ordered the FCC to pursue deregulation](https://www.fcc.gov/consumer-governmental-affairs/fcc-seeks-comment-about-new-deregulatory-initiative). The FCC is asking the industry to tell them every regulation they should slash and why. Their response is due **today, April 11,** with reply comments due on the 28th. I don't think it's a far stretch that the CEO, with his connections to the Trump administration, is preparing for a massive deregulation that could help him expand.

The company[ restructured their debt in January](https://sbgi.net/sinclair-enters-into-agreement-with-creditors-on-liquidity-enhancing-transaction/) in order to free up liquidity in the short term, potentially for expansion. Would make sense in the context of deregulation.

How about state-sponsored media? We know Trump loves television, wouldn't Trump TV pop off? Sinclair would certainly be the host. Their subsidiary Free State aims to assist local and federal government with developing and broadcasting advertising and campaigning. [Here's a snippet:](https://freestategov.com/)

>Free State's mission is to provide the federal government, along with state and local agencies, a full suite of targeted digital marketing and advertising solutions to help government agencies communicate with the American public effectively and efficiently.

From what I’ve gathered, they’re an aerospace and national defense company—so I’m guessing they might be working in tech-enabled aviation, drones, or defense logistics?

Not gonna lie, that price point caught my eye. Aerospace + defense has been heating up lately, and the sector usually sees strong government contracts, but I haven’t been able to find much info yet on financials, backlog, or big-name partners.

Here’s what I’m wondering before jumping in:
	•	Is this a serious growth play, or a speculative moonshot?
	•	Are there any known government contracts or tech partnerships?
	•	What’s their revenue model — commercial, defense, or hybrid?
	•	Does anyone know if this is more like Anduril, AeroVironment, or just another small-cap SPAC in disguise?

1jwdyo5,wallstreetbets,"Turned $20k into $40k overnight on SPY puts, then realized I could’ve had $250k. I am simultaneously a genius and a certified potato.","Well boys, I’m a gambler, but with an MBA in Finance and Economics, which makes me a dangerous retard. Like, I paid six figures to learn how to lose money more efficiently.

So yesterday, while drunk off six tequila sodas and 2.5 bad decisions, I had a vision from the stonk gods (or maybe it was just the hangover kicking in early). I slapped $20k on 150 SPY $525 puts that expired today. Full send. Balls deep. No lube. Just vibes.

Woke up this morning, still half-pickled from last night, saw my account was at $40k. Doubled up. Cool. But my brain—operating at a solid 12% capacity—said, “Nice tendies, let’s not be greedy.” So I sold.

Then I blacked out again metaphorically this time—l and didn’t check the markets until mid-day.

Opened my app…

And those same contracts?

Would’ve been worth $250k.
That’s right. A quarter-freaking-million dollars. From a $20k YOLO. I could’ve walked into Gucci and asked for the deed. I could’ve adopted a baby dolphin. I could’ve bought 500,000 McChickens and still had cash for sauce.

But no.

I locked in my peasant gains and left a private island worth of tendies on the table.

Moral of the story?
Being a responsible trader is for cowards.
Risk management is a scam.
And most importantly, never trade sober.

A win is a win—but this one stinks worse than my ex’s crypto picks.

Anyway, I’ve just thrown the $40k into $50 call options on SQQQ that expire next Friday. We ride again, baby.
Pray for me.

God bless America, and God bless leveraged options.

1jwdal8,wallstreetbets,I all-in'd and held 400k in UVIX for 6 months. I finally sold.,"First off, I would like to preface this with saying my condolences to those who have incurred any losses lately. It has been a very volatile week, and I know many friends and family who have suffered heavy losses in their portfolio and are stressed/anxious for the future to come. With that, I would like to share my experience betting against the American economy by holding one of the most volatile stock for 6 months, UVIX.

As many of you may know, VIX is an index that grows rapidly when the market reverses from a peak. I personally witnessed this during Covid (when TVIX rose almost 2000%) and the recent ""Yen Carry Trade"" of August 5th (when UVIX rose 400%). I've always aspired to time the market successfully with UVIX.

Last year, I felt that the economy was overextended for many reasons. You guys may not agree that these are factors to what led us here, but these are why I ended up taking the biggest risk of my life with such high confidence that the market would crash short-term.

\- US National Debt: We've reached a staggering $36 trillion debt, a large increase of 8 trillion post-covid. To me, this was a huge red flag indicating a looming recession, especially since the market was still pumping.

\- AI Bubble: I think AI is heavily over-hyped, and the rise of NVDA/Tech stocks were not really warranted. I saw this as a bubble bound to pop, much like the dot-com and housing bubble of 2008.

\- Terrible job market: I think we've been experiencing a bad labor market across all sectors for a while now. Employers look to make lay-offs/cost cutting in order to artificially inflate profit margins to boost stock prices, which is not sustainable. I do not believe the numbers released by the Feds at all, they seem suspiciously low compared to real-world experiences of people struggling to find work. This article was one example:  
[https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/us-added-818000-fewer-jobs-thought-adding-concerns-economy-rcna167555](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/us-added-818000-fewer-jobs-thought-adding-concerns-economy-rcna167555)

\- Suicide rate is apparently one of the leading indicator of a struggling economy: In 2024, we reached one of the highest rate in the decade [https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-09-26/u-s-suicide-rate-climbs-back-to-highest-in-decades](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-09-26/u-s-suicide-rate-climbs-back-to-highest-in-decades)

\- Trump winning the presidential election: I was aware of his tariff plans during his campaign, and I knew that if he actually did implement these, it would shock the market. It was only a question of if he would actually deliver on his campaign promise or not, which he did.

With all these reasonings in mind, I had a 90% confidence that the market would crash soon, so I YOLO'd my whole portfolio into UVIX after election.

https://preview.redd.it/ovma6m9vj3ue1.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd719e0b6d0ff7892d07461aa3eae2312d52caea

Holding this ticker was mentally tough, the market kept rallying from 580 to 620 post-election, and my position was decaying and I was holding a -200k loss for the vast majority of the time. Many people discouraged my position, and some think I should cut my losses. I even isolated myself for a while because I was so sure of my bet. There were two moments when I could have sold to break even: Federal reserve announcing no future interest rate cuts and Trump's initial Canada/Mexico tariffs. But UVIX didn't rise as much as I anticipated, so I kept holding.

https://preview.redd.it/e5e6xfsxj3ue1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f45917088fa769ca5123420f1fec427851fbb2f

Fast forward to last week, Trump announced a severe blanket tariff, which crashed the market as we know it. This was finally the moment I've been waiting for as UVIX went from $20 to $100 in the span of 4 days. I kept my eyes on the news, set my alarm to 6 am to watch the market open. UVIX could rapidly drop/rise in matter of seconds, and I did not want to sell too early/late, so I was shedding 1k shares a day to be safe. 1k at 70, 1k at 90, 2k at 100 on Tuesday. At this point, I had 3k remaining, and I was hoping that UVIX would maybe rise to 140, but then Trump sent out the tweet that he's basically cancelling the tariffs, which shot the market back up, and plummeted UVIX to 40, luckily I was able to salvage and sell at 56 on the way down. It wasn't quite the finish I was hoping for, but overall, I did get to gain roughly 250k off of my 400k bet.

https://preview.redd.it/k4bzie1sk3ue1.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=f788c3fce00964a3a5e9f9202b6db85d3f5bda4a

Now that I've been able to cash out on the big -20% SPY crash I've anticipated, I am completely out of UVIX for now. Even if the market continues to fall, I have full confidence that we'll eventually recover back to our previous 620 ATH, so I'll be DCAing into SPXL/TQQQ from this point on until we reach that price.

https://preview.redd.it/8j48yvnul3ue1.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=b68d62402c4fdc3ec905d7c036fcd3cee5ff37f1

In the end, I would not encourage anyone else to do what I did. Even with my conviction and accurate market reading, I had to hold UVIX for 6 months, which ended up being one of the most stressful thing I could do. I've lost sleep, became disillusioned with the economy/government, and absorbed more bad news than I could handle. I've internally cheered for bearish news, despite knowing it could mean hardship for many people.

I was somewhat lucky that Trump did indeed enact his tariffs, otherwise I may have been stuck holding a decaying position until it went to zero or was delisted.

In the end, I'm just relieved that I could finally exit my large UVIX positions, and I will never all-in again the way I did. I hoped you all enjoyed my perspective/story and I wish the best of you luck in navigating this volatile market.",2025-04-11 00:36:46+00:00,5617,352

1jw4ei4,wallstreetbets,Buried Treasuries,"**TL;DR**
This chart is the flowchart version of a hedge fund trying to farm nickels using 10x leverage, in a system duct-taped together by repo plumbing and the hope that volatility stays dead. If this blows up, the Fed has to come out with the “volatility suppressor tool” (a.k.a. buy everything that isn’t nailed down) before margin calls start going out like Amber Alerts.

Short: GS, MS, JPM, TLT
Long: VIX

**What the Hell am I looking at?**

This flowchart illustrates the U.S. Treasury basis trade, a.k.a. the 900 IQ arbitrage strat where hedge funds try to pick up pennies in front of a steamroller made of illiquidity, duration risk, and repo gremlins.

**Here’s the strategy:**
	1.	Hedge funds go long a Treasury bond (usually with borrowed money via the repo market) and short the futures contract on that bond.

	2.	The bond they long is the CTD (Cheapest to Deliver) — think of it as the bond equivalent of buying Temu knockoffs instead of brand name, but only if the Temu knockoff is able to settle into your futures position. *Looks good enough, we’ll let it slide*

	3.	They make money if the “basis” (cash bond price - futures price - repo cost) narrows, which it usually does unless the market experiences significant volatility.

**How they do it:**
	•	Repo dealers slide them the money to buy the bonds. *$20 is $20*

	•	Prime brokers pass the CTD bonds around like they’re at a frat party.

	•	CME clearing asks for margin like a little bitch.

	•	Futures are shorted against the long bond so it’s “delta-neutral,” which is finance speak for “we think we’re hedged but we can’t find the paperwork.”

**Why this matters:**
If and when this spontaneously unwinds (like say, in a liquidity crisis), you get forced deleveraging, margin calls, and Treasury yields go turbo — not because inflation is surging, but because hedge funds are panic-selling like they heard *good afternoon* at a Jpow speech.

Yields skyrocket, bonds fall with equities, and the FED has to act quickly to dampen volatility.

**How to profit:**
OTM SPY puts or VIX calls
Puts on banks with highly leveraged brokerage arms (GS, MS, JPM) or ETFs that include them (XLF, KRE)

**Play for gambler’s ruin speed-runners**

Deep ITM TLT puts (synthetic short) 

Wait for tangible distress in the markets (BTC crashing HARD is a good indicator that risk is off the table for real)

Then Deep ITM TLT calls (synthetic long)

BERLIN (Reuters) - The European Union and China have begun negotiations on the abolition of EU tariffs on imports of Chinese electric cars, German newspaper Handelsblatt reported on Thursday.

EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic met China commerce minister Wang Wentao during a visit to Beijing at the end of March and both sides agreed to resolve a dispute over EU tariffs through negotiations, Handelsblatt reported.

The European Union imposed tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs) late last year, saying they were needed to counter cheap loans, land and raw materials and other subsidies and the goal was a level playing field, not shutting Chinese car makers out.

The European Commission has said it is willing to continue negotiating an alternative to tariffs with China.",2025-04-10 17:46:19+00:00,4384,551

When I saw the parabolic spy candle up my heart sank, I looked at my dashboard and it was going crazy up and down I was so confused I thought it was heading towards a 50%+ loss. But then I remembered that earlier in the day I wanted to hedge against a possible parabolic rally due to tarriff news so I had scrolled through spy options until I got high enough that the massive premiums disappeared and threw 250$ in 533 calls for a couple cents each, think it was about 57 contract in all.

Needless to say by the end of the day my port was saved and even doubled....I could've gotten like triple the profit from these calls but I started slowly selling them after the initial parabolic rally because I was afraid of a pop back down. I'm just so thankful I got saved, going to pull out about half of it.

As everyone knows over the past week stocks across the board were down massively due to tariffs and its implications on the economy.

I was down 10% as of yesterday, quite a shock for a slow dividend investor like myself. I got scared but didn’t know what to do. Should I hold, should I sell? I wasn’t sure.

For some reason this morning, i got this thought in my head that I should sell and take the 10% loss because if this moment is the bottom. Whatever I buy has a high probability of making me alot of money. Which is something I never do.

So I sold this morning, took my 70k and went through the market. I noticed that semi conductor related stocks were down alot and I figured there was a high probability that they would come roaring back once market conditions improved.

I took 26k and bought SOXL at around 8.50$ a share. About an hour later, the tariff pause news came out. My position soared 50% 😱. I never experienced that before. Complete luck. I was only ever interested in the slow dividend burn. 

So im going to hold SOXL to about 35-40 bucks a share and then cash out. Which I think theres a high probability of getting there. Im also buying TNA tomorrow morning with my remaining 40k.

Have I been transformed into a degenerate, if this is the bottom leveraged ETFs could see some huge gains?

Reposting in hopes of re-sparking the discussion on this-- obviously with Trump pausing all tariffs except for China and the dip being bought, it looks like what I said would happen happened.**

**However, phase 2 is just beginning.**

DISCLAIMER: I THINK THEIR PLANS ARE 100% DISTILLED ORGANIC REGARDIUM. HOWEVER, THESE PLANS EXIST; IT ISN'T JUST THE DEATH THROES OF A DEMENTED OLD MAN. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THEIR GOALS AND HOW THEY WANT TO ACHIEVE THEM, SO YOU DON'T GET WIPED OUT BY A SINGULAR MANIAC'S AMBITIONS.

  
“I believe very strongly in tariffs. America is being ripped off. We’re a debtor nation, and we have to tax, we have to tariff, we have to protect this country.”

\--Donald Trump, 1988



[Transshipment](https://china.ucsd.edu/_files/02072025-brief-identify-tariff-evasion-web.pdf) is how China bypasses US trade restrictions-- the idea is simple, just ship to an intermediate country in southeast Asia or Mexico before shipping to the United States. Since the entire goal is to evade detection, it's impossible to get direct numbers on how much Chinese originating volume comes into the U.S. in this manner, but it's estimated to be at the very least tens of billions of dollars in goods per year.

This has also been [top-of-mind from Trump's current administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/02/industry-lawmakers-applaud-president-trumps-section-232-tariffs/), with realizations that the 2018 trade war did not go to the extent of their real goals because of ""loopholes"" and negotiation failures. So, this time around, the goal is the same-- a trade war with China, but the entire world has become collateral damage.

Their goals behind the trade war with China hasn't drastically changed from 2018:

* [Coward Nutlick has repeatedly hinted that ""deindustrialization is a national security risk"".](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-commerce-secretary-howard-lutnick-on-face-the-nation-with-margaret-brennan-april-6-2025/) In layman's terms, if a war ever broke out, [China would be able to pump out missiles and weapons at a faster pace.](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA787225532&sid=sitemap&v=2.1&it=r&p=AONE&sw=w&userGroupName=anon%7E3a357c28&aty=open-web-entry) Peter Navarro has said that ""every time you buy a good made in China, you are financing their navy in the Taiwan strait."" His book Death by China (2011) also details how we are dependent on their supply chains for medical supplies, electronics, and weapons.
* Miran, senior economic advisor to Trump: [trade deficits are economic dependence.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/04/cea-chairman-steve-miran-hudson-institute-event-remarks/) True at face value, but the dependency goes both ways. As with the fundamental theory of trading and competitive advantage goes, both sides win. U.S. industry is built off the back of Chinese supply and labor, and the Chinese have become wealthy off of the largest consumer market in the world.

So, the plan that would somewhat explain their intentions behind tariffing the world is to get other countries to come to the table, fence-off Chinese transshipping, and/or strike deals that cut off Chinese suppliers to third party countries as well. This would explain why they imposed tariffs on penguin-inhabited islands such as [Heard and McDonald Island](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/04/revealed-how-trump-tariffs-slugged-norfolk-island-and-uninhabited-heard-and-mcdonald-islands)\-- closing off loopholes. They want to hurt China while hurting ourselves, but think that we can withstand the pain more than they can. It's unclear as to whether they're right, or if this game is even worth playing, but it's definitely *a plan, even if it's a bad one,* which is better for the market than having no narrative or confidence.

What does this mean in the short term? Trump has no intention to keep unjustifiably high tariffs on everyone else *besides China.* As deals are struck, either side capitulates, it becomes clear that ""liberation day"" was just a second attempt at 2018 U.S. vs. China, which, to investors, is at least preferable to U.S. vs. The World (for seemingly no reason). With a narrative to cling onto and a return to (relative) normalcy, the markets can go up in the short term because of a universal instinct to ""buy the dip."" The markets no longer have reason to freefall panic that a literal maniac is driving the world economy to ruin; he at least has a plan, if not a half-baked one.

**\^ this was posted on 2025-04-08 2:12PM ET.**

**""TRUMP HAS NO INTENTION TO KEEP UNJUSTIFIABLY HIGH TARIFFS ON EVERYONE ELSE BESIDES CHINA"" --me**

**""THE MARKETS CAN GO UP IN THE SHORT TERM BECAUSE OF A UNIVERSAL INSTINCT TO BUY THE DIP"" --me**

**""TO INVESTORS, U.S. VS. CHINA IS PREFERABLE TO U.S. VS. THE WORLD"" --me**

However, as the initial panic subsides, the ramifications of ""reducing the trade deficit with China"" will set in. Numbers like earnings, inflation, consumer spending, and GDP growth will bleed. Eventually unemployment, defaults, and bankruptcies will follow, putting the Fed in an unwinnable situation. The private sector won't want to build US factories, find alternative trading partners (who will take the opportunity to increase prices), and ""reindustrialize"" because the Republicans could simply lose in a few years, and the policy is reversed. Imagine spending billions in U.S., factories paying 5x in wages, only for these cheap overseas pathways to open up again. There needs to be private sector *confidence* that these policies are set in stone, which is why Trump has continually attempted to affirm that they are. But they aren't. Cost-push inflation is going to rile the peasants in the U.S. once again to chop off the heads of the incumbents, and Republicans are projected to lose bigly in 2026 and 2028.

tl;dr: Since the goal is to ""Reduce the trade deficit with China,"" this will directly eat into profit margins of U.S. companies and the spending power of the working class, at a failed attempt to reindustrialize America. China may be hurt as well; but in this future, it may be at a cost of a popping AI bubble and a new U.S. depression.

**UPDATE AFTER TRUMP HAS PAUSED ALL TARIFFS EXCEPT FOR CHINA**

I think this is a bit of corroboration to my original theory that global tariffs was an attempt to strong-arm the rest of the world into U.S.'s side against China. If you were to get my opinion on whether this was the most intelligent or reasonable way to do it, I obviously have an endless amount of things to say. But my opinion doesn't matter; this post is simply trying to discern their ambitions, and how they will try to achieve them. Understanding the incentives behind this chaos is of supreme importance to best navigate it.

Who are these people that Trump has surrounded himself with? Navarro, Miran, Lighthizer, Kudlow, Barr, Bannon, Mnuchin, Rubio, Waltz, Helberg, Bolton, Pottinger, Wray...

Navarro refused to comply with a Jan. 6 subpoena, in 2023 was sentenced to 4 months in prison. He also promoted Lab Leak conspiracies and has had a long history of questionable policy advocacy, solely focused on how China is ""ripping off the world."" Trump's rhetoric on China, trade deficits, and tariffs is almost ripped straight from Navarro's various books. Lighthizer and Miran have long advocated for using high tariffs as a coercive weapon, and have had histories of downplaying the effects of retaliation on domestic industries. Some of these anti-China allies are truly focused on national security with legitimate concerns over IP theft and Chinese rapid militarization.

Are these people the originators of Trump's ideology, or did Trump select the fringe, controversial figures in economics and defense that corroborated with his worldview? It's unclear, but no matter how this unified political stance came to be, the conclusion is simple:

**Trump's administration believes that national security vs. China is the critical goal that potentially supercedes the Stock Market, domestic industrial stability, inflation, and the buying power of the average American. They are willing to destroy access to Chinese supply chains to force America to ""decouple"" with China.** **They don't care about Apple, Tesla, the S&P 500, etc; for one, Trump thinks that the Fed will eventually do ZIRP and infinite QE to pump the stocks once more, and that slashing 50% off of Apple is worth it as long as they find other suppliers or build domestic supply chains.**

**He believes in ""short term pain,"" however, in a year or a few years, U.S. capital dominance will survive, after purging the ""dependency"" on China.**

Simply put:

AAPL, TSLA, WMT, NKE, BBY, QCOM, INTC 2026 PUTS.

However, in the short term, stocks will continue to pump as the ""apocalypse cancelled; buy the dip"" reflex continues over the rest of the week.

The Trump administration has reversed course on plans to restrict exports of Nvidia's H20 artificial intelligence chips to China after CEO Jensen Huang attended a Mar-a-Lago dinner last week, NPR reported on Wednesday.

The reversal comes despite months of work on new export controls and mounting national security concerns from both sides of the aisle. Nvidia’s H20 chip is currently the most advanced AI hardware legally allowed for export to China, and Chinese firms like ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent have reportedly placed around $16 billion in orders just in Q1.

Sources suggest the about-face was tied to Nvidia’s promise of new AI investments in U.S. data centers - effectively trading access to Chinese markets for domestic tech growth. The White House and Nvidia have both declined to comment.",2025-04-09 18:19:31+00:00,272,43

1jv9csy,wallstreetbets,"Trading Day: All pain, no gain on Wall Street","Well, folks, what started as a hopeful relief rally in Asia and Europe turned into a total dumpster fire for U.S. markets today. Wall Street was riding high with stocks up nearly 5% early on, but then Trump doubled down on his promise of insane 104% tariffs on Chinese imports, and it all went to hell. The S&P 500 dropped 1.6%, closing below 5000 for the first time in a year, while the Nasdaq took a 2%+ beating and is now down 25% from its December peak. Meanwhile, long-dated U.S. bond yields spiked hard—30-year yields are up 36 bps in just two days, one of the wildest jumps ever. Investors are freaking out, and it’s not hard to see why: this trade war escalation with China is looking uglier by the minute.

Overseas, it’s a mixed bag. Japan’s Nikkei had a banger day, up 6%, and European stocks popped 3.5%, their best in over three years—guess they’re still riding the “maybe we dodge the worst of this” wave. But China’s yuan? Oof, it’s getting crushed, hitting an all-time low past 7.40 per dollar offshore, and people are betting Beijing might weaponize its currency in this mess. Safe-haven currencies like the yen and Swiss franc are up over 1% against the dollar, while oil’s down 2%—Brent crude’s lost 30% in a year. Oh, and Trump’s team is out here trying to sweet-talk Japan and South Korea into tariff deals, but the China standoff is the real market-killer. Optimism? Dead. Futures are pointing to a 2% drop at tomorrow’s open. Buckle up.

The kicker? Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trump want those 10-year yields down to ease borrowing costs and the government’s monster debt burden, but the market’s like, “Nah, fam.” Yields are climbing despite the chaos—10-year’s above 4.10-4.20% again—because tariffs might juice inflation, and the Fed’s not rushing to cut rates (Powell’s sounding hawkish AF). Foreign investors aren’t piling into Treasuries like they used to either, maybe because faith in U.S. assets is shaky with all this tariff drama and political noise. China could even start dumping bonds as a trade war flex. Bottom line: markets are a mess, yields won’t behave, and this global trade showdown’s got everyone on edge. Thoughts?

*TLDR : LONG the Apparel/Footwear sector. Particularly: Vans, Nike, Adidas, Puma, Lululemon, Calvin Klein, Crocs, Decker you name it.*

Few points on why I'm extremely bullish on the apparel sector as of today:

1. On talks of the reshoring of jobs, SWEATSHOPS are the last thing they would want. Someone correct me if I missed it, but I haven't heard anyone from the White House talk about bringing back the textile industry. It’s all semiconductors, autos, steel—high-tech or heavy industry. Apparel/footwear likely will end up getting a very light tariff or even a pass after Vietnam bends the knee and buy BOEING jets and treasuries.
2. Bessent’s already hinted these tariffs are the ceiling, not the floor—negotiations will bring them down. **Vietnam's Deputy Prime Minister is scheduled to talk to Bessent today**. And later-on executives from Boeing/Apple etc. Apparel/footwear’s taken a HUGE hit because Vietnam’s because these companies spent CAPEX to build manufacturing there to dodge those China tariffs. This broad based 40% tariff will end up causing US companies to pay their share.
3. On inventories, Levi’s CEO said two days ago guided next quarter’s gross margin steady. Why? Summer inventory’s are currently already in the US. **Most apparel companies have a 2-4 month lead-time before they have to reorder from Vietnam, Cambodia, or Bangladesh**. If negotiations wrap up in the coming 3-4 weeks, it’s back to business—no disruption.
4. Bond Yields Screwed the Macros. US 10-Year jumped from 3.9% to 4.4% in two days—probably smoked a few macro funds. Trump has repeatedly talked about lowing the 10Y and China retaliating isn't helping. The expedites the negotiations, it has to happen NOW or someone has to fold soon --- either the FED, US, China or the economy.
5. And the cherry on top of all is the tariffs spooked consumers into panic buying. Next quarter’s YoY numbers will look juicy. All predicated that Vietnam bend's the knee, which I bet they will for most things.

There's other things like 2026 Nov Mid-terms election (which Trump wants to declare massive victory), and massive tax-cuts and deregulation to be bullish about, but i'll leave it for another day when it comes.

Downside:  
A natural calamity totally wipes humanity out, and we return back to the ocean, reuniting with nature. At least you could claim you had the balls to buy the DIP.

Amazon is considering a $15 billion warehouse expansion plan for about 80 new logistics facilities in U.S. cities and rural areas, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The company is asking potential capital partners to submit proposals, according to the report, which said the facilities are expected to be mostly delivery hubs, but some of the properties would also include large fulfillment centers packed with robots.

The e-commerce company's request for information from financing partners predated U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff announcement from last week, Bloomberg said, adding it was unclear how the shift in trade policy would impact Amazon's plans.

An expansion of this scale would mark a significant turn in Amazon's investments in its e-commerce business. Having invested heavily in its retail operations throughout the pandemic, the company has cut back spending on the business in recent years, instead focusing sharply on its cloud unit and AI technologies.",2025-04-09 14:34:35+00:00,85,48

1jv0l7a,wallstreetbets,It looks like somebody saved Musk from a margin call in 2022,"Let's reiew some details around Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter. On April 14th, 2020, Musk announced he wanted to buy Twitter. Initially, Twitter resisted the proposal. Six days after the initial announcement (April 20th), Musk announced he'd secured funding for the deal, funding which, according to a [commitment letter from Morgan Stanley](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922049844/tm2213189d8_ex99-i.htm), included a $12.5 billion margin loan against Musk's TSLA stock. Then, on April 25th, Twitter dropped its opposition to the proposal and accepted Musk's offer.

But the $12.5 billion margin loan never happened. And I find the timeline of how it didn't happen very interesting. On May 4th, Musk announced [revised financing terms](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922056055/tm2214608-1_sc13da.htm) which cut the margin loan to $6.25 billion. Then on May 13th Musk announced was the deal ""on hold"", before two hours later saying he was ""Still committed to acquisition"". But this left people wondering what the hell Musk was doing. Then on May 24th Musk announced [new financing terms](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922064655/tm2216931d1_sc13da.htm) with no margin loan. At the time, financial columnist Matt Levine [interpreted this as proof](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-05-26/elon-called-off-his-margin-loan) that Musk was just kidding about the deal being ""on hold"". After all, it's not like putting a deal that's already been signed ""on hold"" is a thing in the M&A world anyway.

Except then in July, Musk's lawyers sent Twitter a letter, [made public in an SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922078413/tm2220599d1_ex99-p.htm), saying they really were terminating the deal based on alleged breach of contract on Twitter's part. Twitter sued, and Musk looked ready to fight, before finally going ahead with the acquisition in October.

It's a good thing (for Musk, anyway) that the margin loan never happened. According to the commitment letter, the $12.5 billion loan would've been against $62.5 billion in TSLA stock, and would be subject to a margin call if the loan value ever exceeded 35% of the value of the collateral. Furthermore, on January 3rd of the following year, TSLA closed below $325/share, and almost fell below $305/share three days later before recovering. (TSLA has since undergone a 3:1 stock split, so if you're comparing to the current price, think of this as almost hitting $100/share.) Under the original financing plan for the Twitter deal, this almost certainly would have result in a margin call, since in the entire month of October, when the deal closed, the stock had never fallen below $600/share (or $200/share in split-adjusted terms).

Then, in a coda almost nobody noticed, Tesla released the [proxy statement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000119312523094075/d451342ddef14a.htm) for its 2023 shareholder meeting, which included a section on ""Board Responsiveness"", which stated, ""We have received, and continue to periodically receive, helpful input regarding a number of stockholder-related matters... As a result, we have adopted a number of significant changes, including but not limited to... Amending our pledging policy to... cap the aggregate loan or investment amount that can be collateralized by the pledged stock of our CEO to the lesser of $3.5 billion or twenty-five percent (25%) of the total value of the pledged stock"". No such policy was mentioned in the [2022 proxy statement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459022022992/tsla-pre14a_20220804.htm), obviously—it would've made the original proposal to acquire Twitter with a $12.5 billion margin loan impossible.

Taken together, all of this makes me think that *somebody* freaked out when Musk announced his original plan to finance the Twitter acquisition, and basically told him, ""what the fuck? No, you can't do that"". When billionaires get margin called, it can absolutely tank the stock price, which is probably why the commitment letter set such a relatively low threshold (35%) for triggering a margin call.

I think what happened in May 2022 is Musk initially tried to placate whoever was telling him ""fuck no"" by cutting the size of the loan in half, and when they weren't placated he tried to back out fo the deal, because he made the offer when he thought he could do the deal entirely with borrowed money and got cold feet when faced with the prospect of actually having to sell, rather than just borrow against, his TSLA stock to get the deal done. But in telling Musk ""fuck no"", whoever it was **saved Musk from himself and a margin call**.

It doesn't really matter who the ""somebody"" was, though I can't help but wonder if it was Tesla's largest shareholder—Vanguard. While known mainly for pioneering index funds, not noisy activist investing, and while I have never heard of them *starting* a proxy fight, Vanguard 100% *will* side with activist investors in proxy fights if they feel it's warranted. And they much more frequently ""engage"" with companies, and when your largest shareholder engages with you, you take it seriously, even when the engagement is phrased as polite suggestions. So I wonder if all the will-he-or-won't-he drama about acquiring Twitter in 2022 was because Vanguard wasn't happy with Musk's original plan.

Anyway, none of this means a Musk margin call is *impossible*, but I suspect it could only happen if Tesla was publicly known to be at risk of bankruptcy. I company is in serious trouble, but if you're betting against it (as I am), don't suddenly start getting careless if, say, the stock price drops to $120/share and there's a rumor going around further drops are a sure bet because Musk is getting margin called.

1juzopa,wallstreetbets,Keep your eye on the bonds,"TLDR - Good work not getting trapped by words, ape. Go buy stonks!

Good morning, everyone!

Bonds are boring, no one gets rich off of them. But we're probably entering into a trade war (former Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez thinks we're already in one) and now macro economics actually matter. When this happens stocks don't always go up and the opinions of non-Americans can affect pricing.

So I would recommend keeping an eye on the monthly and 10-year treasuries because they are going to show domestic and international sentiment.

Monthlies have been sticking between 4.35-4.38% for the last 30 days. Flat

10-years notes were lowering into the trade madness as the US is the bestest safe haven in most storms. It went from 4.36% on 3/27 (27/3 for our friends around the world) to 3.99% on 4/4 (4/4 for our internationals). Since then it has shot back up to 4.42% and quickly rising today.

Stocks are down a lot. You know.

To save you the time of asking ChatGPT what happens **if this trend continues** \- flat monthlies, rapidly rising 10-years, and a falling stock market usually means a few things

1. Probable steeping of the yield curve caused by policy or inflation concerns.
2. Stagflation - usually a decade of absolute investment and Main Street pain. Volker saved us last time by burying the short term economy but that may not be an option as we had a debt-to-GDP ratio of 25% then vs. \~125% now. Raising rates that high without some sort of debt relief would mean 120% of your taxes go to debt (no actual math was done for this statement)
3. Reduced long-term confidence in the government and economy of the USA. You may not care, but the reason why the US is the way it is is (FU, it's grammatically correct) because of foreign countries. You don't get to be 26% of the world's GDP with only 4.2% of the world's population without trading partners.

So keep an eye out because macro matters again. Best of luck to you all

I think this will be the best China play if Trump does add an additional 50% tariffs for Chinese imports.

$DE is that evil company that lost the right to repair suit.  
Also, in 2022 the US exported more than 35B in value for agriculture to China.

So if the trade war with China continues, US farmers will not only have to pay more for farming equipment, but they will also lose the ability to sell their GMO franken-crops to the number 1 export trade partner for agriculture.

SPX contracts.

SPX follows S&P500

But more importantly, SPX contracts are **CASH SETTLED**.

Which means, the contracts themselves will just pay you the difference in price at expiration, No need to sell.

Which also means your pesky broker has no need to sell you out end of day, because you do not have any assignment risk nor will you have to buy/sell shares at exercise time.

Did I also mention these contracts are **TAX-ADAVNTAGED**.

Been sharing some of my plays here lately, just trying to stay consistent. Planning to pick up some $250 puts later today if the setup looks right.

Had a solid day of swing trading yesterday, ended up locking in around $110k in gains. Rolled that momentum into some $TQQQ 40c, and closed them out this morning for $72k. Honestly, just grateful the market’s been kind lately.

Still sticking to my belief (some call it the *broken clock theory*)—that Nasdaq will find its way back to 16,200 before making a real move in either direction. No crystal ball, just what feels right based on the chop we’ve been seeing.

1jtztlc,wallstreetbets,"Is the reporting of this rally being caused by ""Fake News"" wrong?","Most sources are claiming the flash-rally was due to a fake tweet about a 90-day tariff pause. However, I'm struggling to find evidence that this is the case, and am hoping to get some of your thoughts. The timeline I currently have:

9:45am - Market rally begins

9:53am - Hasset, on Fox news, responds to the question of 'Will you do a 90 day pause' with: ""Yeah... you know, the president is going to decide what the president's going to decide"".

10:00am - S&P locks in at the 5000 resistance level

10:10am - Fast rally into positive territory

10:13am - The supposed triggering tweet for this ""Fake News"" driven rally comes out

~10:15am - News outlets begin reporting the potential 90-day pause. 

10:17am - The rally peaks, and shortly after multiple stations begin reporting that a flash rally was caused by a ""Fake News"" mistake about a 90-day rally.

[Edit] [This article](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2025/04/07/how-4-trillion-from-the-stock-market-in-minutes/) clearly shows the 10:13 (tweet) and 10:14 (CNBC) timestamps and that the rally was basically done by then. Combined with market action starting at 10:10, I feel this is definitive proof that neither were the actual originators of the misinformation. 

Some are claiming the fake news popped up on the Bloomberg terminals a few minutes prior, though I've yet to see any screenshots or timestamp of when that happened. While it would explain how we spiked a few minutes before the ""info"" went public, it brings all the more question as to how this was able to make it to the terminals, and who had this supposed news even earlier. In such a scenario, it's not simply some tweet causing a flash rise, but a much more (supposedly) reliable system that picked it up erroneously.

# Key Takeaways

* Shares of Rigetti Computing and IonQ gained Monday after the companies were among those selected to participate in a Department of Defense program.
* Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which also made the list, saw its shares rise.
* Shares of some quantum computing companies not selected and other artificial intelligence stocks made gains as well.

Shares of Rigetti Computing (RGTI) and IonQ (IONQ) led a quantum computing stock rally Monday in the wake of a new government initiative and as [artificial intelligence stocks rebounded](https://www.investopedia.com/nvidia-supermicro-surge-as-chip-and-ai-stocks-rebound-from-tariff-rout-11710658) from their recent tariff-fueled selloff.

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which operates under the Department of Defense, late last week announced 15 companies for a program it said will explore whether it’s possible to build a “useful” quantum computer that ""can achieve utility-scale operation—meaning its computational value exceeds its cost"" by 2033.

Rigetti shares jumped about 11%, while IonQ added 10% Monday after being named for the program. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), which also made the list, saw its shares rise 4%.

Some quantum companies not selected got a boost, too, as [D-Wave Quantum](https://www.investopedia.com/quantum-computing-stocks-soar-wednesday-as-d-wave-claims-breakthrough-11695768) (QBTS) shares gained close to 5% and Quantum Computing (QUBT) added 4%. Nvidia (NVDA), which Rigetti has partnered with, also saw its stock climb.

The gains came even as worries about new tariffs continued to weigh on broader markets, with the Dow and S&P 500 posting losses. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, however, finished Monday's session with a slight gain of 0.1%.

(Reuters) -The European Commission proposed counter-tariffs of 25% on a range of U.S. goods on Monday in response to President Donald Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminium, a document seen by Reuters showed.

The tariffs on some goods will take effect May 16 and others later in the year, on December 1, the document said.

The goods are wide-ranging and include diamonds, eggs, dental floss, sausages and poultry. The counter-tariffs on almonds and soybeans will take effect on December 1.

EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic said earlier on Monday the counter-tariffs would have less impact than the previously announced 26 billion euros ($28.45 billion).

Bourbon, wine and dairy have been removed from the original list the Commission was weighing in March.

The Commission had earmarked a 50% tariff on bourbon, which had prompted Trump to threaten a 200% counter-tariff on EU alcoholic drinks if the bloc went ahead.

Trump's threat worried France and Italy in particular owing to their significant wine industries.

In addition to these counter-tariffs, the EU already tightened existing safeguards on steel on April 1 to reduce imports by 15%. The Commission is also looking at import quotas for aluminium.

EU member states are due to vote on this proposal on April 9.

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - The European Union's countermeasures targeting a list of U.S. imports in response to the Trump's administration steel and aluminum tariffs will be less than 26 billion euros' ($28.46 billion) worth after taking in account member states' remarks, EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic told reporters on Monday.

""When it comes to steel, aluminum and derivatives (...) we are talking about 26 billion euros. We are finalizing the list tonight (...) but I can tell you that it will not be up to the level of 26 billion euros, because we've been listening very carefully to our member states,"" he told reporters.

As part of the U.S. administration's sweeping tariffs plan, the 27-nation EU bloc faces 25% import tariffs on steel and aluminium and cars.

""We wanted to make sure that the burden is spread fairly among all member states,"" Sefcovic added.

Earlier in the day, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen held a call with metals industry representatives on Monday and was due to speak later to the automobile sector about how to respond to U.S. tariffs.

# TLDR

I believe $RKT price is poised to increase dramatically over the next few months due to the all-stock acquisition of $COOP. COOP investors can dramatically amplify profits w/ minimal risk by doing this. 

# Intro

Hello All,

I'm back after a little more than a week since my [last DD blew up in my face](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jlsxw4/quantum_computing_inc_all_aboard_the_shit_coaster/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) with the market wide Tariff ~~panic~~ sell-off. I have been very bearish overall for the past couple of months, shorting Starbucks, IonQ and as of last week, Natural Gas. One company, Mr. Cooper ($COOP), caught my eye and I opened a considerably large starter position on it earlier this month. 

Mr. Cooper is THE company that was uniquely poised to make an absolute killing with the upcoming home refinancing wave that will take place in the US with the likely coming rate cuts. Mr. Cooper’s refinancing model stands out by combining a vast customer base, a digital-first platform, and unique perks like the 1% Mortgage Markdown and no-fee Rate-Swap program. With a top-rated app and U.S.-based advisors, it simplifies the process, cuts costs, and boosts accessibility for borrowers. Couple their unique model with the fact that their management, outstanding performance and average annual YoY growth of **36.24% over the past 5 years** and it's a no brainer that they are a pure gem to buy.

I was mixed with joy and sorrow Monday (3/31) when I found out that they were being bought out by Rocket Companies ($RKT) for $9B @ $143/share in **an all stock transaction closing Q4 2025**, just 40% above their current stock price at the time of the announcement. I wasn't even close to building my full position and $RKT was among the first companies I ruled out when trying to find a good stock for timing the likely upcoming rate cuts. **Mr. Cooper shareholders will receive 11 shares of $RKT in exchange for every one share of $COOP they own at the time of closing**. This will essentially be a 3:4 stock-split as there were will be 25% more shares of RKT after the COOP merger. **Combined, RKT and COOP will represent 16.67% of all home mortgages in the US.** It's worth noting that [Redfin ($RDFN)](https://ir.rocketcompanies.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Rocket-Companies-to-Acquire-Redfin-Accelerating-Purchase-Mortgage-Strategy/default.aspx) is also being acquired by $RKT for $1.75B in all stock transaction that will close before the $COOP merger.

# Thesis

After doing some napkin math I've concluded that the fair value of $RKT after the merger is around $17.00, \~10% more than their closing price this Friday of $15.40. But, *I never said it would stop at $17***.** 

Imagine, if you will, that you are an institutional holder of Mr. Cooper, don't necessarily want to own RKT and can't stop the merger. What can you do here to **REALLY** come out on top? Well, you could run the price of $RKT up to tremendous levels, secure your position with PUTS and sell your RKT stake, so, when you receive 11 shares, you will be dramatically amplifying profit via your newly acquired RKT shares. I've made a simple 5 step process where I will attempt to profit from every phase of what I believe will be a wild ride.

  
**STEP 1: I WILL JOIN IN RUNNING $RKT PRICE UP**

At this very moment, I believe this phase is going into effect. Let's say the price target of the ""conspirators"" is $40/shr, near the ATH but a nice round number. Since the announcement of the merger, RKT price is up 25%, showing no signs of exhaustion while the rest of the market is bleeding out on the floor (as of 9:40 PM ET 4/6/2025).  Industry peers are not performing similarly. RKT ""hobbit-merchants"" are currently in an extremely tight spot w/ 22% of the float being currently borrowed by said hobbit-merchants and the hobbit-fees are steadily climbing. This stock is NOT lucrative for hobbit-merchants as it is extremely well positioned for the upcoming recession. There are much easier stocks to hobbit-sell. The hobbits will cause most of the price movement if large quantities of shares are continually gobbled up. 

*As of pre-market Monday 4/7, someone opened a huge straddle of the June $24.2 strike. Implying they are anticipating a massive move*

  
**STEP 2: I WILL BUY $RKT Q1 2026 PUTS**

After reaching my desired theoretical price of $40/share, I will buy PUTS exp in Q1 2026. I believe this will be the strategy of many institutions as maintaining this sky-high price for a prolonged duration can be expensive and adds unnecessary exposure*.* If someone holds 100 shares of COOP they would want to ideally own 11 PUTS of $RKT. *These PUTS will come in handy later!*

Optional: Sell OTM PUT DEBIT SPREADS for Q1 2026 (I like doing this too)

**STEP 3: I WILL DUMP $RKT SHARES/CALLS AFTER BUYING PUTS**

Sell shares of RKT along with calls (all I own currently). Kind of counterintuitive, but these PUTS are not being bought as insurance, rather, insatiable greed.

**STEP 4: DO NOTHING UNTIL BUSINESS COMBINATION**

Wait for merger to take effect. Maybe buy more PUTS if IV knifes. If the play goes as planned this far, I'd be willing to bet an activist short seller releases a report to pick this low hanging fruit.

**STEP 5: ???**

Hope deal doesn't fall through.

**STEP 6: REALIZE PROFIT AFTER MERGER SELL-OFF.**

Once the merger happens, the aforementioned COOP institutional holders that don't want RKT shares will EXERCISE THEIR PUTS to get rid of their shares at strikes that should be deep ITM, making a literal shit ton of money w/ low effort. The price will tumble from the high volume of said selling. I will be totally out at this point and hopefully disgustingly rich.

  
**Current Position**

**$COOP** \- All that is remaining from my starter position, I will close this out soon.


**$RKT** \- Degenerate, I know. I will continue to gradually add more calls and stock. Most of these buys are me ""testing the waters"". I won't start any new positions expiring earlier than May.

1jthv06,wallstreetbets,watching for snapback setups off gap down open with historical reference and setup potential,"if open is lower than what we are all expecting, would focus on watching for short term reversal setups in a few oversold names. not necessarily entering into anything early but waiting for key levels to come into and watch for signs of exhaustion based on historical context in previous flushes discussed under, extreme pressure tends to revert when it gets stretched too far intraday.

so as for the historical context framework, after the 1987 crash the dow recovered about 57 percent in the two sessions that followed the bottom. same thing happened after the 2008 october flush and again in march 2020. 

the context shifts but the structure tends to repeat. liquidity dries up, forced selling takes over, and once that flow slows down you often get sharp intraday reversals even in weak broader trends. 
in 87 the crash accelerated because of dynamic hedging strategies that sold more as prices dropped, creating a feedback loop that hit futures first and then cash markets. books got overwhelmed, bids vanished, and once that flow exhausted the bounce came fast. 

in 08 it was margin pressure and credit risk. banks had to unwind whatever was liquid and those with tighter funding positions, pretty much made the selling spiral worse until coordinated policy stepped in. 
same thing again in 2020 where no one knew what earnings or demand would look like so everything risk got dumped. volatility went to the moon and alot sectors started moving in sync, and depth disappeared until liquidity support came in and flipped the tape. 

now the potential ‘black monday’ we face shouldn’t be a repeat of 87 imo, but some of the same stress points are showing up. risk is extended, volatility is climbing, liquidity’s thinning out, and this recent price action looks like the front end of a liquidation cycle. if we gap down hard and that volume keeps pushing into weak books, the key is watching when that forced flow dries up. that’s usually when things snap back fast intraday and structure starts to reset. nothing guaranteed but it’s a pattern that’s repeated across every major dislocation. 

recent positions similar to this framework include tsla calls on pre march 20th setups in hood, reddit and more. all of them opened heavy and reversed clean once selling pressure faded. setups were mostly based on volume spikes near prior levels and reclaiming vwap after early weakness. this kind of move matches intraday reversal probability especially when it comes from liquidity holes followed by clear buying into strength

still holding a bearish lean overall into 26’ and early 27’. positioned with spy 2026 puts and exposure in cvna and arkk. already explained the reasoning in previous posts in the sub.

(Bloomberg) — One of Wall Street’s most bullish Tesla Inc. analysts slashed his price target for the stock by 43%, citing a brand crisis created by Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump’s trade policies.

“Tesla has essentially become a political symbol globally,” Daniel Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst who’s rated the carmaker’s shares a buy for the last four years, wrote in a report to clients Sunday. “It is time for Musk to step up, read the room, and be a leader in this time of uncertainty.”

Ives reduced his Tesla share-price target to $315 from $550, which had been the second-highest among the 72 analysts tracked by Bloomberg.

Ives’ biggest concern is the potential for Tesla to get caught up in backlash against the US president’s tariff policies in China, where Tesla generated more than a fifth of its revenue last year. President Xi Jinping’s government plans to impose a 34% tariff on all imports from the US starting April 10, matching the level of Trump’s so-called reciprocal tariffs on Chinese products.

“This will further drive Chinese consumers to buy domestic such as BYD, Nio, Xpeng and others,” Ives said in his note issued Sunday. “We now estimate Tesla has lost/destroyed at least 10% of its future customer base globally based on self-created brand issues, and this could be a conservative estimate.”

Tesla shares plunged 15% in the two days after Trump announced he would apply at least a 10% tariff on all countries’ imports into the US, with even higher duties on some 60 nations to counter trade imbalances.

1jspvu0,wallstreetbets,There is only wendys dumpster!!!,"In short term

•	⁠EU will announce reverse tariffs next week.
•	⁠China just moved its target tariff by another 17% (based on the 50% rule of the additional 34% reverse tariffs)
•	⁠India and Taiwan are still on the fence and are not brining their top leaders (Central ministers) to the table which means they can decide anything.
•	⁠Canada has already said FU
•	⁠Mexico, Brazil and Cambodia are just watching and have yet to start negotiating with large players (their ground level discussions are still at secretary of commerce level and not at ministerial levels for such a big bang)

Taking the best case scenario country here - Vietnam has not yet committed and is saying it can take up-to 1 month before it can firm up its decision at ground level which then means US will react to revert back its tariffs after that and say a week. So thats atleast 6 weeks away. 

Guessing on how long it takes to restart imports and other supply chain that is paused - Atleast 6 weeks. Because when you press the pause button there is supply chain from port of exit till port of entry that has not yet been handed over. They just don’t stop the ship mid ocean and wait for a restart. These go into either hold or return shipped and to restart it takes things from scratch. So by these tariffs companies like Nike have already messed their six week supply chain which is 40% of their quarter. Good luck with next quarter results!!!

So best case a quick stabilization in the next 1 week and then another small dip (5%) in earnings season and then slow growth (upto 2 years)

Worst case we are fucked another 15-20% with each negative decision by trading countries hammering us a low single digit downtrend and stabilizing as govt starts making any sense. ",2025-04-06 08:58:07+00:00,666,303

What happened on Monday, in particular was there a loss or gain greater than 1%

Note that this is not every Friday loss greater than 1%, if Monday closed within 1% of Friday's close then that event did not make this chart. 

I am looking only for Negative Fridays followed by significant movement on Monday. 

Here are the Fridays, as you see all this research gets us nowhere, so you might as well just bet your feelings I guess. 

I say the markets crash hard on Monday, but if not Monday then Tuesday, and I will use this data to support that opinion, even though the data doesn't really support that opinion. 

Besides past performance.. future.. etc, this is obviously a different situation than what the markets are used to. 

So here is the data, use it to erroneously  defend your totally random opinion for Monday.

The google sheets function you want for historical index data is ""GOOGLEFINANCE(""INDEXSP:.INX"",""price"", DATE"") 

The unfortunate thing for me, is that I bet on a crash. Not a lot, a small percentage, and most of my $$ was pulled out of the market in late December.

This last week they lost 20% of their income that they have to live off of for the rest of their lives.   They’ve got to be terrified.

So where do they move their money?  Into treasury bonds - right?  I’m looking at TLT (20 year treasury bonds etf) going up this week, what do you all think?  TLT calls?

Orrr…they just lost 20% and can’t afford to reinvest to they keep it in there hoping it rebounds this week.  I dunno, I’m just a regard.  ",2025-04-06 01:55:02+00:00,124,142

1jrv81r,wallstreetbets,"Why are ETFs like UVXY or VIXY ""not meant for long term investment"" when my experience has been the opposite?","**Resolved: Answer to my question found thanks to u/throwaway_0x90 with their link to https://money.stackexchange.com/a/66669**


Like the title says, I'm wondering why every single trading platform warns you and makes you agree to disclosures warning as such when my experience has been the opposite.

I get they're meant for day traders to buy and sell intraday but also feel if you time it right it can be a wise long term investment.

For context, whenever the economy was doing well or felt the stock market was overdue for an adjustment I'd buy shares of something like UVXY or VIXY for dirt cheap; I know eventually the market will tank, the VIX will spike and with it UVXY upon which I'd sell it when I felt its near its peak.

I made around 200% on the COVID pandemic crash once I sold it, and so far am up 100% on the current market crash.

I personally felt like this was a smart move, but the constant warnings make me feel the Dunning-Kruger effect may be in full force here and I'm really just a lucky idiot.

What gives?

Edit: To clarify, I get holding them for years on end is a horrible idea. But buying right before you think theres a crash and selling when you think its at a peak seems smart to me, but every trading platform warns not to do that and that its meant for intraday trading

Edit 2 electric boogaloo: Again to clarify, my strategy has been buy a few months before you think its gonna tank when the markets still doing ""well"" for dirt cheap, hold for a few months till you think it peaks, sell, then use that cash to reinvest in stocks. All the trading platforms I've tried this on have explicitly warned me against it.",2025-04-05 04:20:20+00:00,0,51

1jrlpp7,wallstreetbets,[DD] Uranium is the play for bulls during this time,"This DD is inspired by the minerals guy 2 days ago. After reading his legit DD about MP, I have looked into minerals and believe that the play in Minerals should be at this time. My ticker is different from him, I think UUUU has more potentials than MP. Here is why:

**Short-term catalyst:**

1). Executive Order from President Trump:

10 days ago, President Trump signed an Executive Order to boost the mineral production domestics. Basically, this EO will helps under 30 days from the day 03/20:

* Fasten priority projects for permits
* Federal land utilizations
* Increase capital investments in minerals production
* Use more capital to support mineral production internationally

I think that this is a great EO for UUUU because:

* It has some pending projects waiting for production:
   * Nichols Ranch Project (Expected to be July 2025 but can be expedited)
   * Jane Dough Project (Expalnded for the above project)
   * Hank Project
* It has [numerouse projects that are currently](https://www.energyfuels.com/conventional-operations/) in production in the US
* The Madgascar government just lift the suspension for the big project (Toliara Mineral Sand Project)

\--> UUUU has everything to benefit from the Executive Order

2). Mineral news:

* 2 days before the Executive Order, we received the strategic partnership with a friend called Chemours Company (CC). This partnership is to help the domestic Uranium pipeline. So I wonder what is this company doing?
   * To summarize, this company doing performance chemistry products (like cooling chemistry). I checked that CC has a new partnership in 03/14 in helping [data centers to cool down and energy demand (AI?)](https://investors.chemours.com/news-releases/news-release-details/chemours-joins-forces-ntt-data-and-hibiya-engineering-ltd-full)
   * The data shows that the insider trading shows that they mostly hold the stock (323000 award and 7500 sale). So I think that this stock and UUUU will partners to do for the Rare Earth Minerals
* US Uraniums are c[urrently > 90% are importing ](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/nuclear/where-our-uranium-comes-from.php)from the other countries.
   * From the government, until 2022 we are only importing Uranium mostly from Canada (10% tariff if you don't want to Google it), Kazakhstan, Uzkeistan and Australia.
   * We have almost no production in Uranium, and Uranium is strategic resources especially after Trump impose tariff on every country --> Expand and fasten process for UUUU for many projects

3). Oversold ?:

* UUUU is currently trading with $3.45, almost at all time low, it's P/B is currently at 1.9 (while its competitors is trading at around \~8.0)
* Uranium has been lowered these months due to tariffs, but with the new Executive Order, I believe that Uranium can be brought up in domestic.

**Long term catalyst:**

* UUUU projects will be started/developed in 2025 and 2026, and I believe that they will be a successful projects because UUUU is a leader in Uranium and have been here for a while
* UUUU expects to turn to profit in 2025 after last quarter report.
* As long as President Trump still wants production in the US, Uranium and UUUU gonna get benefits from

1jriqim,wallstreetbets,Quarter million+ gain on QQQ puts,"On January 15, 2025 I purchased 113 QQQ puts for a price of $4 per contract ($45,200), with an expiry of April 17, 2025.

I closed the position near the low today, and sold all 113 contracts for $27 each.

This was a roller coaster of a position. During the mid March drill down I was up about 200%, but kept holding. This past week I was down 75%, and said fuck it I’m holding and praying Trump tariffs drill the market, and well, the rest is history.

I definitely think the market will be heading lower from here but with expiry so soon, I can’t really be anymore greedy than I already am. I could very easily get caught in a bull trap/dead cat bounce next week and lose all of these gains.

1jrdvhk,wallstreetbets,Meaning on Aryzta,"Meaning on Arzyta

Given Donny‘s imposed tariffs I was looking for stocks in Europe, especially Switzerland who are operationally not getting hurt. While screening the Swiss Performance Index I found Arzyta, a large bakery. Why I‘m bullish on the stock:
- No operations in the US
- No sales in the US
- Sourcing their commodities (wheat) mainly within Europe, Australia, Malaysia -> no tariffs
- Sales is 89% Europe, 11% RoW
- they continously improved their balance sheet
- they bought back a hybrid bond which will reduce their financing costs by approx. EUR 11.5% (this is 8.34% of their free cash flow!)They expect this to fully materialite in 2025 —> the buy back happened in October 2024

The above are the facts (soure is their 2024 FY report).

Now some additional thoughts:
- Wheat producers in EU will most likely not sell anymore to the USA which means they will have a over capacity which leads to lower prices. Wheat is perishable that means the cost of purchase will most likely decrease amd hence increase their operational margin

- Given the high tariffs imposed by the US it is likely that the EU and Switzerland will decrease their interest rates which means ARYN could refinance them cheaper

- The market should recognize the company to be a Consumer Staple which would allow higher multiples in terms of valuation

- There are only few analysts covering the stock (all of them have a Buy or Strong Buy rating)

GENEVA (Reuters) - China said it had opened a formal complaint against the new U.S. tariffs with the World Trade Organization on Friday, saying the measures violate WTO rules and requesting consultations.

Earlier, China announced retaliatory additional tariffs of 34% on U.S. goods, the most serious escalation in a trade war with President Donald Trump that has fed fears of a recession and touched off a global stock market rout.

""China has filed the WTO complaint with respect to the United States' measures,"" the Permanent Mission of China to the World Trade Organization said in a statement.

The new tariffs blatantly violate WTO rules, it added.

In the standoff between the world's top two economies, Beijing also announced controls on exports of some rare earths which it dominates, potentially cutting the U.S. off from critical minerals vital to everything from smartphones to electric car batteries and defence.

Trump on Wednesday announced China would be hit with a 34% tariff, on top of the 20% he previously imposed earlier this year, bringing the total new levies to 54% and close to the 60% figure he had threatened while on the campaign trail.

Chinese exporters, like those from other economies around the world, will face a 10% baseline tariff, as part of the new 34% levy, on almost all goods shipped to the world's largest consumer economy from Saturday before the remaining, higher ""reciprocal tariffs"" take effect from April 9.

China on Thursday urged the United States to immediately cancel its latest tariffs.

The WTO Secretariat confirmed to Reuters on Friday that it had received the request for consultations from China.

Bilateral consultations are the first stage of formal dispute settlement. If no solution is found within 60 days, China could request adjudication by the Geneva-based organisation's Dispute Settlement Body.",2025-04-04 12:57:28+00:00,4536,288

Data from [the Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm) released Friday showed 228,000 new jobs were created in March, more than the 140,000 expected by economists, and above than the 117,000 seen in February. The unemployment rate rose to 4.2% from the 4.1% seen in the prior month. February's monthly job gains were revised lower from a previous reading of 151,000.

1jqv7m3,wallstreetbets,🌈🐻 LFG part 2 - Liberation Day + XSP vs SPY explanation,"Ok so first... yes, fuck me for the beautiful bulbous gains. This is just what I was holding towards the end of the day and I actually pared down a few more on that last drop at the end of the day. In total I'm up about $50k with about $35k realized now. Total cost basis was about $15k. Probably my best trade ever so please don't look to me for trade advice. I'm just as regarded as the next guy in this sub.

**SPY vs XSP**: The reason I trade XSP options vs SPY options is because of an obscure tax rule known as Section 1256 (I'm a CPA fyi). SPY is an ETF as I'm sure every regard knows, but XSP is an index. Without getting too technical, basically gains from index options are treated as 60% long term / 40% short term. Gains from regular options on stocks/ETFs/etc are going to be 100% short term (unless you held the option for over a year, which i'm assuming most regards are not). If you're really regarded you may not realize, but long term gains are subject to lower taxes. 

**TLDR**: XSP options taxed more favorably than SPY options

Originally, when I found about the tax rule I only knew about SPX (S&P500) and NDX (Nasdaq). You can trade these for the same section 1256 tax treatment, however the notional amounts for these contracts are much larger. One atm SPX contract is about $12k and for NDX it's something like $50k. $XSP and $XND are mini/micro versions so equivalent option contracts are only a fraction. This allows me buy contracts in bunches to DCA my cost basis or leave runners when I have gains. Note that I actually started with XND options in late Feb. They work just as well, but much lower volume than XSP, which is why I primarily started trading XSP options.

I don't heavily trade options like this on a regular basis. Last time I did was during Covid volatility and subsequent run up. This correction from all time highs just seemed pretty obvious (imo) especially when the new admin started threatening reciprocal tariffs. It was a speculative gamble that paid off. I could've just as easily been fucked right now if the tariff announcements were better than expected. The reason I was pretty confident in the overall direction of the market was when I read that most institutional money/professional money managers have been steadily decreasing their market exposure to US equities in response to the planned tariffs.

What's next? No fucking clue. Obviously depends a lot on whether tariffs are scaled back and favorable trade deals are negotiated. I still have some long exposure to stocks and ETFs that I'll be looking to DCA my cost basis. Fixed income looks chill in my opinion. I may sell some puts on stocks I'd like to own at discounted prices. I'll also probably buy a few more lotto puts in case shit really starts to the hit the fan.

I used puts mostly but also had calls on GLD, IBIT, NVDA and OKLO as a partial hedge to my short positions.

I’m still heavily net short as I anticipate retaliatory tariffs will be applied by other countries.  I expect these headlines to drop intermittently over the next few weeks so I think upside for the major indices is effectively capped at maybe 3-5%.

So apparently we priced in Armageddon but not Super Armageddon. I was floored when I saw what was unveiled on Liberation Day. Yall can clown on me for being wrong in my DD when I said no one cares about tariffs. HOWEVER, this does not change my opinion on Robinhood. I figured it was a good idea to estimate what the option bids were going to be on open so I could sell at a small loss and open a position on Monday when the options prices lowered to dirt cheap. I was tired of getting manhandled by theta on my calls, so I went all in on one massive call that got hammered in price recently.

Main events I am watching is JPOW tomorrow because I have some FDs for Friday not big enough to post, Earnings smash on 4/30, possible S&P 500 inclusion in early June, crypto event this summer, more prediction markets for major leagues possible.

Buying options at dirt cheap and continuing my contrarian idea because everyone thinks the bear market is guaranteed this year, so logically they all aren’t allowed to be right.

1jqfz91,wallstreetbets,[DD] How to Profit Off the Trade War [$500k invested],"Hello everyone,

This morning, I wanted to discuss the implications of the trade war for your investment strategies. I get the sense that many of you are misunderstanding what is happening right now. Retail investors consider this to be the beginning of a bear market. But they don’t realize that a bear market in one sector can mean tremendous opportunity in another. Institutional investors consider this to be the beginning of a major sector rotation into a sector that has been massively undervalued and neglected: American industry, energy, and materials. I am going to explain how you can come to understand all of this as an opportunity.

Those that follow my last few posts on mining, infrastructure, energy transitions (e.g. [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1iuykwm/the_sector_youve_never_touched_is_a_10bagger_but/) and, most recently, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1j42h15/blackrock_made_a_move_on_panama_ports_theyre/))  know that I have been anticipating continued actions (including steep tariffs) by the present administration to combat Chinese influence over critical mineral and metal supply chains. My entire portfolio has more-or-less been restructured from the beginning of the  term with this background assumption in mind. My research over the last months has focused on understanding which companies stand to benefit from increased import/export controls. Again, my emphasis is on domestic metals, minerals, and mining specifically.

**I. Context Setting**

My thesis remains fundamentally unchanged. It is as follows:

>**Thesis/Summary:** the mining industry presents a massive opportunity anywhere from right now to the end of the present US administration and hopefully beyond. The investments that will matter most have to do with the processing, extraction, separation, and manufacturing of titanium, lithium, and rare earth minerals deemed critical. These investments must be allied with western interests, ideally operating in the United States. The issue that is most relevant is the complete market dominance China has over these metals and rare earth minerals. 

In the past, I have supported this position by examining the present administration’s executive orders, legislative agenda, as well as conducting an analysis of major hedge fund and institutional holdings beginning 2024 Q4. In this post, I will instead point out the general features of my most treasured investments which have earned them the right to exist in my portfolio. 

As I explained previously, my methodology for investment decisions have been guided by the following principles:

1. First, priority should be given to domestic companies looking to mine, refine, and develop critical metals/minerals in the USA or who may be substantial suppliers of our critical minerals stockpile. Secondary priority should be given to those companies part of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, and/or within Canada, and wishing to mine, refine, or develop critical metals/minerals in the USA, or who may be stockpile suppliers.
2. Priority should be given to companies that have substantial federal contracts already or have projects presently awaiting government permits, funding, or regulative actions, where such action would be expressly in the USA national security interest.
3. Priority should be given to companies that have institutionally and politically well-resourced members involved in their board, leadership, governing body.
4. Priority should be given to companies represented unusually strongly in the portfolio of major hedge funds, have unusual levels of insider activity, and/or are represented in the financial disclosures of politicians in Washington, D.C.
5. Priority should be given to companies that have established they can deliver results or who have a head start in their particular niche of the industry relative to competitors.

It should be rather straightforward to see how it is, exactly, that these considerations could lead one to investment strategies that will be shielded from international export/import controls. 

Let me run you through one example of an investment choice I have made that has aligned with the considerations above: **MP Materials.** The company is entirely focused on the domestic US supply chain for rare earths and minerals critical to national security, energy, transportation, technology, and so on. They are also the *only* company in the entire US that is vertically integrated: able to not only mine materials, but also to refine and process them, etc.

They have massive [federal funding contracts](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/2941793/dod-awards-35-million-to-mp-materials-to-build-us-heavy-rare-earth-separation-c/), their CEO is extremely well-connected, institutional holdings increased massively in Q4 2024 ([Blackrock took a 10% stake;](https://fintel.io/i/blackrock) Australia’s richest woman, Gina Rinehart, who is a close friend and supporter[ of Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/20/gina-rinehart-anthony-pratty-donald-trump-us-newspaper-ads-inauguration), took a 9% stake in the company through her investment fund, Hancock Prospecting).  In addition to all of this, MP has [scaled quickl](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx)y in both their early supply chain (mining-side) sector, as well as mid-stream, having recently begun operations of a new refining facility in TX. 

In my view, MP has the domestic side of this sector backed into the corner. It’s not even close.

**II. Positions Explained**

What are the rest of my positions? It is a mixture of stock/equity and delta-focused derivatives (I only hold calls, not puts). I love leveraged positions, generally. Anyways, here are my holdings, though they do not include my HSA investments. You can ignore RDDT, UPS, AMZN. Those are unrelated.

Briefly, here are few of what I consider my top holdings and what they do:

1. MP: Heavy Rare Earth Mining, Processing, Magnets
2. UUUU: Uranium and Titanium
3. LAC: Lithium/batteries
4. ABAT: Lithium Battery & Recycling
5. VAL: Deepsea mining infrastructure.

I know this is a scary time for a lot of people. Please do take a breath and consider how you think the next few years will unfold, carefully. I hope my post is useful to some of you and I welcome further thoughts on investment strategies in this brave new world.

1jqfkva,wallstreetbets,"$100 put spreads into $9,400 gain","Pin risk worked in my favor this time I guess.

I bought these put spreads before close, then when I saw SPY was around $551 after trump pulled out his tariff bingo card, I called my brokerage to exercise the 559 puts. 

They told me on the phone it was possible the other party would not exercise their $558 puts. I thought yeah right, they're like $9 ITM but okay whatever I'll take the risk.

Actually can't believe that I woke up and was short 700 shares of SPY.

The put spreads cost me $10 each, I closed 3 of them at 0.25 before the market closed to cover my cost and let the rest ride into close.",2025-04-03 11:09:07+00:00,706,29
1jqf8an,wallstreetbets,The most important move in the markets right now in my opinion is...,"the US dollar index (ticker $DXY). It's down around 2% right now in the premarket:

https://preview.redd.it/4tww7exmnlse1.png?width=394&format=png&auto=webp&s=79dac309346ec443300b54ecc4fb418ea3284481

What does this mean? To me this likely means foreign investors are pulling out of US markets because of all of the uncertainty related to tariffs. Note that imports become even more expensive when the dollar weakens. One thing to keep in mind however is that the US dollar index is still at a normal level historically speaking:

https://preview.redd.it/jt2kam9pnlse1.png?width=390&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bd17ff410e78d980037baf8d5b97ea25751929b

As you can see, the US dollar index has bounced off the $100 level over the past few years multiple times. A big reason for this is because the dollar rises when the Fed raises rates. However the Fed can't realistically raise rates at the moment without tipping the US into a recession, so I don't know how much they can do to support the dollar if it falls below $100.",2025-04-03 10:49:39+00:00,355,158

I think everyone seems to be forgetting that big tech will begin facing budget constraints due to tariffs which will slow down their AI investments until the Ai sector figures out how to shift production components away from china. Since AI hardware is capital intensive it only makes sense that big tech will be temporarily forced to cut major purchases until they’ve gained more clarity on cost structures. It’s likely big tech customers (who make up a big chunk of AI revenue) will find ways to make supply chain adjustments so that they don’t fall behind to their competitors…but this adjustment period will significantly cause delays and potential slow down in order volumes from chip and data centers as companies figure out  how to reduce exposure to tariffs(in the short term). I am bullish long term but I think this logistical issue will get in the way of good earnings in the next few quarters on all our favorite AI stocks.

The EU is preparing a response to the US duties. Brussels is considering a complete market closure for American goods, [El País](https://elpais.com/internacional/2025-03-31/bruselas-respondera-sin-lineas-rojas-a-los-aranceles-de-trump-a-los-productos-europeos.html?event_log=go) reports.

The European Union is preparing to retaliate against the introduction of new duties by the Donald Trump administration, which will come into force on April 2.

Brussels is considering the possibility of using a full arsenal of measures, including restricting the access of American companies to the European market and public tenders. This was reported by a source of El País in the EU.

The new US customs tariffs, which Trump calls ""reciprocal,"" could seriously affect trade relations between the two sides of the Atlantic.

According to the US administration, the annual volume of imports and exports between the US and the EU reaches 900 billion euros, with a trade balance of 235.5 billion euros in favor of Europe.

In response, the European Commission is considering tough measures, including imposing tariffs on American goods, restricting access to European financial markets, and even banning American companies from participating in EU-funded projects.

At the same time, European capitals, including France, Italy, and Ireland, are calling for a cautious approach to avoid a full-blown trade war.

Despite the escalating situation, Brussels continues to try to negotiate with Washington. The EU is even offering some concessions, including lower duties on industrial goods and increased purchases of American liquefied natural gas.

However, if the US does not abandon the new customs restrictions, Europe is ready to act without red lines.

# Europe's reaction

Instead, he urged him to focus on China.

(Reuters) - The Trump administration is considering revoking tariff exemptions for low-value shipments from China, known as ""de minimis,"" as part of Wednesday's tariff announcement, a source familiar with the plans said.

The de minimis rule allows goods valued under $800 to enter the U.S. without tariffs, a loophole that has benefited Chinese e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu. Revoking this exemption would align with broader efforts to counter China's trade practices and strengthen U.S. manufacturing.

The tariff measures, set to be announced Wednesday, include a 25% tariff on automobile imports beginning April 3, with additional duties on auto parts expected to follow. The administration argues that these tariffs will help protect domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign manufacturers.

""We are taking strong action to ensure American businesses compete on a level playing field,"" a senior White House official said.

However, critics warn that these moves could have unintended consequences. Some economists estimate that tariffs could increase costs for American consumers, with one analysis suggesting that U.S. households could pay an additional $3,400 annually. Trading partners, including the European Union, have expressed concern, with some considering retaliatory tariffs that could further strain global trade relations.",2025-04-02 19:53:50+00:00,1229,143

1jps2rr,wallstreetbets,Rivian posts sharp fall in quarterly deliveries as soft demand weighs,"(Reuters) - Rivian reported a 36% decline in first-quarter deliveries on Wednesday, as the electric-vehicle maker grapples with weak demand, sending its shares down nearly 6%.

EV makers have been battling tough demand as consumers opt for cheaper hybrid and gas-powered vehicles in an uncertain economic and political environment.

""I would say the sector at the moment is out of favor. Over the medium to long term, EVs are still inevitable, and so it's just going to take some time for these companies to continue to ramp up,"" said Andres Sheppard, senior equity analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald.

Rivian Chief Financial Officer Claire McDonough had said in February vehicle deliveries would be lower this year due to soft demand, partially because of the impact of fires in Los Angeles.

Demand could be further pressured as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies are expected to accelerate inflation and increase prices of automobiles, making consumers wary of committing to big purchases.

Sheppard said Rivian's margins would be affected by tariffs, and it could face a larger hit from the duties as opposed to bigger players such as Tesla.

Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe had said earlier this year the company expects higher costs from tariffs on Mexico and Canada as it has a supply chain footprint in these countries.

The company delivered 8,640 vehicles in the quarter ended March 31, down from 13,588 a year earlier. But the deliveries exceeded analysts' estimate of 8,200, according to Visible Alpha.

Tesla reported a 13% slump in quarterly sales, its weakest performance in nearly three years, as backlash to CEO Elon Musk's embrace of far-right politics grows and consumers seek out newer models from rival EV makers.

Rivian produced 14,611 vehicles in the first quarter, compared with 13,980 a year ago. It reaffirmed its annual deliveries forecast.",2025-04-02 15:55:43+00:00,240,89

1jppc69,wallstreetbets,Nvidia-backed CoreWeave is the biggest U.S. tech IPO since 2021,"We've got a fresh IPO that just hit Nasdaq last Friday and options already trade on this! CoreWeave / $CRWV is a Nvidia-backed cloud AI services provider. $CRWV is one of the first pure-play AI IPOs, offering AI technology in the cloud. It's backers: Nvidia, Fidelity, and Magnetar. Nvidia even anchored the IPO with a $250 million order. 

Financials: CoreWeave raised $1.5 billion in its IPO, the most for a U.S. tech offering since 2021. Revenue last year was $1.92 billion, up 737% from the year before. Growth is undeniable, but there's also a net loss of $863 million reported last year. (D'uh).

Strong Customer Base: Microsoft, Meta, IBM, and Cohere are all customers. Microsoft alone accounts for 62% of CoreWeave's revenue.

The IPO priced below the expected range, opening at $39 and closing at $40. Friday was a shitty day (-3% nasdaq) to IPO.

So, what's the play?

This isn't a short-term YOLO imho, IV is so high it's only good for writing puts. Shares for me, but you do you. Also do your own DD, obviously. Current market price is still kinda close to IPO range.

1jpj2kz,wallstreetbets,"NVDA and ""Liberation Day""","NVDA and Tariff Day

This thesis serves not only as analysis of NVDA and the semiconductor sector, but is a prediction for tomorrow - ""liberation day"".  

NVDA has a wide moat due to its CUDA software, and essentially holds a monopoly on parallel processing. Not only is this a focus of massive Mag 7 AI CAPEX, but it has an ever increasing amount of use cases due to developments in autonomous driving, IOT, robotics, healthcare, and more. While DeepSeek and tariff concerns have driven shares down recently, the company has an exceptional balance sheet and a 0.92 estimated EPS for its upcoming call.  

The current administration has clearly outlined its intention to be competitive in artificial intelligence, announcing in January Project Stargate, which aims to build out massive amounts of data centers in the United States with investment in AI deemed a strategic imperative.  

A close partner of NVDA, TSMC is the clear leader in semiconductor foundries due to its cutting edge nodes, which are protected by high barrier to entry and clear lack of viable domestic competition. Just yesterday, Commerce Secretary Lutnick stated to Bloomberg that TSMC's recent commitment to investing over $100 billion in the United States exemplified the actions this administration is seeking before distributing CHIPS Act grants. This investment was announced during TSMC CEO Wei's visit to the White House, with Mandango praising him as one of the most respected people in business, claiming a policy victory as Wei's actions reflected an intention to avoid tariffs through negotiation.  

Mandango is using tariffs as a form of economic brinkmanship, in an attempt to force companies to the negotiation table where they will capitulate and strike deals favorable to the United States. But with global supply chains being necessary for the semiconductor industry to function, the administration's stated goals of AI competitiveness, and the need for computation seeming insatiable, Mandango will carve out space in policy that is favorable for the sector. While the market as a whole may still see volatility in response to these policy changes, NVDA and the like will be an exception.  

TL;DR - Supporting domestic semiconductor design is critically important to the current administration's stated goals and sentiment around negative tariff impact is overblown.

I didn't get to post my DD with my YOLO because I failed a ban bet. Also I forgot to put it in the post.

Last week’s gold event: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdFjAhDP3sM&ab\_channel=Robinhood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdFjAhDP3sM&ab_channel=Robinhood)

TLDR: IMO Robinhood is the best stock on the market right now with a great business model and the best team and has the most upside potential, even during a market downturn.

They had 1.5 million gold subscribers at $5/month last year. Now MORE THAN DOUBLED TO 3.2 MILLION.

Robinhood has the potential to become the next trillion-dollar company. Everyone is always looking for the next stock that will have NVDA or TSLA-like growth and I have good reason to believe that Robinhood is the one. Literally a 30-bagger since they’re at $37 billion, which is NOTHING. For example, about $1 trillion flew out of Nvidia in like a month and Robinhood only needs around $55 billion more to reach $100/share. They actually have a good business model leading the great leap forward in transforming finance with a CEO that is already mainstream. Man is on CNBC last week: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpoKCzJVrU0&ab\_channel=CNBCTelevision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpoKCzJVrU0&ab_channel=CNBCTelevision)

They are going to smash earnings again IMO. Been taking money hand over fist. They already smashed earnings last quarter.

I’d say that inclusion into the S&P 500 is on the horizon. They just missed it last quarter but I see no reason why they can’t be in this quarter with a lot of stocks tanking. And we all know what happened when TSLA was put into the S&P 500 with a similarly well-known CEO known as the Elongated Muskrat. ROCKET EMOJI.

Robinhood is overhauling everything with their services, including the use of AI. That’s right. The AI buzzword. They cap their fees at $250/year for investment advisor systems.

Cash delivery? Bruh I’m never going to an ATM again: [https://robinhood.com/us/en/banking/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/banking/)

They have 12 partner banks so FDIC insurance is $2.5 million with them instead of $250,000: [https://robinhood.com/us/en/gold/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/gold/)

Robinhood is now VENMO/Apple Pay. You can send money to people instantly: [https://robinhood.com/us/en/banking/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/banking/)

Robinhood makes money on everything. Options, crypto, and now even straight-up gambling with prediction markets. Even in a terrible market they still make money on fees and subscriptions.

I don't really care about any litigation involving prediction markets and I don't think anyone else does either. Gambling always wins.

Cathie Wood bought like $25 million recently (Now holds 5% of ARKK’s holdings, TSLA is 11% for reference) and it was given a price target of $105 last week: [https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/bernstein-maintains-robinhood-outperform-rating-105-target-93CH-3951578](https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/bernstein-maintains-robinhood-outperform-rating-105-target-93CH-3951578)

IRA contribution and 401k transfer match is literally a money magnet.

People will live their entire financial lives through Robinhood. They have high-yield interest rates on uninvested cash and have a debit card. Kind of like how people use WeChat for everything.

They also have a credit card with 3% cash back on EVERYTHING (best on the market from what I’ve seen) = more money.

Great Wealth Transfer putting trillions of dollars in Millennials and Gen Z hands, going straight to RH for gambling, and especially on this sub.

Robinhood is honestly like a 7x leveraged SPY imo. Every time SPY is up 1% Robinhood is up 7%, and vice versa with the same chart pattern. SPY really only needs to go to 570 for HOOD to go to $50 from $42. $50 by the end of the week bc we will get the clarity from the big dude tomorrow.

Easy to use platform.

I am also predicting we have a face-ripping rally on liberation day because no one gives a fuck about tariffs. This is all about selling the rumor and buying the news so we all have certainty. JPOW also speaks Friday so my boy is going to pump it up.

-

’Twas the night before tariffs, and all through the Street,
The traders were anxious, all glued to their seats.
Their orders were placed with precision and care,
In hopes that the White House would choose to play fair.

The bulls clutched their charts, their bets running high,
While bears rubbed their hands, expecting a dive.
And I with my laptop, a coffee in tow,
Refreshed every headline, awaiting the blow.

When out on the tape there arose such a clatter,
I sprang to my screen to see what was the matter.
Away to my Bloomberg, I clicked with a flash,
Skimmed through the news, prepared for a crash.

The headlines declared in big, flashing red,
“Tariffs confirmed!”—my stomach felt dread.
Steel and aluminum, twenty-five strong,
With autos and tech not far along.

China, the EU, and Canada too,
All in the crosshairs—what else is new?
No deals, no breaks, no truce left in sight,
Just markets in turmoil and fear overnight.

Then what to my weary eyes should appear,
But Powell himself with a smirk ear to ear.
He lifted his mic and cleared out his throat,
Then gave us a speech with a familiar note.

“The economy’s strong, inflation runs high,
Rate cuts are coming, but don’t ask me why.
Tariffs may hit, but markets will fight,
Just buy the damn dip and you’ll be alright.”

And just like that, the futures turned green,
Traders rejoiced—it felt like a dream!
I sighed as I watched, for deep down I knew,
That Powell and tariffs were playing us too.

So I logged out my screen and turned off the light,
“Happy trading to all, and to all—hedge it right!”",2025-04-02 00:41:07+00:00,6893,278

The number of vacancies fell slightly from a revised 7.8 million in January and from a 8.4 million a year earlier. Openings have come down more or less steadily since peaking at 12.2 million in March 2022 when the economy was still roaring back from COVID-19 lockdowns.

The American job market has proven surprisingly durable. But it has clearly lost momentum from the frantic hiring days of 2021-2023. And the outlook for hiring is cloudy as President Donald Trump pursues trade wars, purges the federal workforce and promises to deport millions of immigrants working in the United States illegally.

On Friday, the Labor Department issues the jobs report for March. According to a survey of forecasters by the data firm FactSet, it is expected to show that employers added 125,000 jobs last month, down from 151,000 in February and an average 168,000 a month in 2024.

Gamers can choose to watch video advertisement, up to 30 seconds long, in exchange for boosts, lifelines or resources in a particular game through rewarded videos.

In the coming weeks, brands and agencies will be able to purchase this new form of marketing either directly or through Google's ad platform, making Roblox's offerings more widely available to a larger set of advertisers.

With Roblox's main videogame platform seeing strong engagement and monetization, the company has been looking to expand its overall business with advertising to take advantage of its large Gen Z user base.

Roblox had 85.3 million Daily Active Users on its platform as of its quarter ended December 31, with the majority these users being above the age of 13.

""Because gamers are so entrenched in the experience itself, traditional ad formats haven't always been the right choice for app publishers, because they don't want to pull their audiences out of those games,"" Scott Sheffer, vice president of sellside monetization at Google said in a roundtable briefing.

Amid stiff competition in the gaming industry, the advertising business has allowed Roblox to diversify revenue streams and position itself as an attractive option for marketers in search of a large audience.

Reuters reported last year the company hired former Roku executive Louqman Parampath to aid its advertising business.

Roblox has also partnered with data measurement firms such as Cint, DoubleVerify and Nielsen to help brands track the performance of their campaigns.

Over the coming months, other ad formats such as billboards will come to Google Ad Manager, the company said.",2025-04-01 13:14:54+00:00,91,15

1jolbco,wallstreetbets,Tariffs on Tech,"***TLDR;*** *Analysts have emphasized the impacts of tariffs on commodities, autos, and tangible goods. However, the escalation of this tariff trade war will most significantly impact digital goods.*

***The Play TLDR***; *Short tech (QQQ puts, SPY puts, SOXL puts)*  


On April 2nd, we will (allegedly) learn what Donald Trump's plan will be for ""rolling back unfair trade practices that have been ripping off America"". Currently, analysts are primarily focused on illustrating the impacts of these tariffs on commodities and industrials. Understandably, since these asset classes are most commonly included in U.S. top export metrics:

***THE POINT:***

  
In 1998, the World Trade Organization (WTO) temporarily banned tariffs on a class of assets called ""electronic transmissions"" (digital goods). This decision was made due to the rapid and unparalleled emergence of a new medium of information exchange called **the ""internet"".**

  
This ban prevented members from charging tariffs on goods provided electronically over the web. This temporary ban has been reviewed every two years by member countries, with the outcome being that it is mutually beneficial to keep the moratorium in place.  
This moratorium has played a ***critical*** role in U.S. tech's profitability:



[Current framework of free digital trade](https://preview.redd.it/sfyu2o6gp4se1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4025959602f933ad83942912a6ffadfda84f97b)

In the example above, a company providing digital goods/services can trade freely with other countries. Digital transactions are not treated like physical goods transported internationally, where the goods must be declared at customs and taxes paid on their value.

  
This framework has been deemed to be in the best interest of the world for **decades**, and all political parties have managed to put aside their differences to ensure this framework's survival for the greater good. However, ***Trump's current economic offensive has put this framework at risk when/if other countries decide to ""strike back"":***  


[Framework for digital trade under tariffs](https://preview.redd.it/8ty1db2sp4se1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c14880088e780e48b6796d64f5295d40e572fd0c)

***THE PROBLEM:***

Nearly [$270B or 70% of U.S. ""services"" exports](https://project-disco.org/21st-century-trade/new-government-data-shows-digital-services-exports-continue-to-drive-u-s-trade/) come from digital goods. Referring to the first picture of this post, this is roughly $62B more than the current top U.S. tangible goods export (Cars/Car parts (implied)). 

The problem, then, is derived from the following:

[\>50&#37; of the revenue of the S&P 500 IT sectors comes from foreign countries](https://preview.redd.it/7oxbsiqis4se1.png?width=520&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c978c1b69a7f9b22ee05f14060974c87508e801)

NVDA, GOOG, META, AAPL, and other tech stocks would incur significant losses from the termination of the 1998 e-commerce moratorium.

***The Endgame:*** 

The tariffs proposed by the Trump administration will **invalidate** the 1998 WTO moratorium agreement **->** Foreign governments looking to push back against the U.S. tariffs will target U.S. tech and digital goods/services **->** U.S. tech margins will contract, as they are forced to account for taxes/tariffs on services provided internationally (i.e. Netflix pays tariffs on shows streamed by consumers in Europe) **->** U.S. economy will enter a recession due to the concentration of the top 10% of wealth (locked in the stock market) compromising \~50% of all U.S. spending

1joiknz,wallstreetbets,Fed’s Williams says rates to remain steady for 'some time' amid Trump tariff uncertainty,"New York Federal Reserve president John Williams told Yahoo Finance he expects the central bank to keep rates unchanged for ""some time"" as [policymakers watch](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-fed-has-a-new-favorite-word-uncertainty-080031361.html) how new tariffs from President Trump affect the economy.

The tariffs, he added in an interview Monday, could produce ""more prolonged effects"" on inflation and he warned that it could take a few years to figure that all out.

""It is still early days to be able to come to a concrete conclusion around this,"" Williams said, noting that the central bank will be watching for ""indirect effects"" from new duties that “might not be fully felt for a couple of years.""

“Yes, we will see tariffs affect prices and then we will just have to keep watching how do those cascade into prices downstream to other goods in the economy,” he added, saying the Fed needs to “really have an open mind about how long these last in terms of their effects on inflation and the economy.”

The new comments from one of the Fed’s most influential policymakers come as central bankers wrestle with [the many uncertainties](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-fed-has-a-new-favorite-word-uncertainty-080031361.html) ahead as the president rolls out his new trade policies. The next step comes Wednesday as the president is expected to unveil a set of new tariffs on many other countries.

The question for the Fed is whether any price increases caused by inflation will pass quickly or linger.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said that his ""base case"" is that any extra inflation from Trump's slate of tariffs will be ""transitory.""

But [some of his colleagues worry the effects could be more persistent](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-fed-has-a-new-favorite-word-uncertainty-080031361.html), adding to the uncertainties ahead for the central bank.

The Fed's goal is to get inflation down to its 2% target, but a key measure released last Friday remains well above that marker. The ""core"" Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 2.8% year over year.

Inflation now stands at the level the Fed predicted it would be at year's end — and that's before some of Trump's most aggressive tariff plans kick in.

The worry among some economists and market watchers is that inflation could rise and economic growth could slow, creating a so-called stagflation environment that was last seen in the 1970s.

Williams said he sees no signs of stagflation ""now,"" citing an unemployment rate of 4.1% and headline inflation around 2.5%.

He also pledged, ""We will not let high inflation take root like it did in the 70s and 80s.""

At the same time, though, “there is definitely a risk of inflation being higher than what’s in the forecast.”

The economy, he said, is ""in a very good place,"" but he acknowledged a “lot of uncertainty” about how it will evolve this year.

He also noted that uncertainty has shifted somewhat more toward concerns about slowing economic growth, but he says also there is a greater risk of rising inflation.

“My own view is economy will continue to grow but slower than it did last year.”

Williams kept coming back to the level of uncertainty, using that word a total of nine times.

""There's a lot of uncertainty about how the economy will evolve and a lot of uncertainty about all the policy actions. We'll see about that, but also how the US economy, and importantly, the global economy, respond to these developments.""

Thus, for ""some time"" he expects the Fed to keep its rates unchanged as it did at its last meeting earlier this month.",2025-04-01 00:22:00+00:00,735,93

1jobofs,wallstreetbets,What forecasted news would realistically turn the market around this year? Seriously,"Just my opinion, and I hope I’m wrong when I say I really don’t see anything that’s bullish for this year. Between the job market data that may be poor in the near future, the increased cost of goods due to tariffs, and possibly less overall foreign investment also due to tariffs/the trade war, it’s looking pretty bleak. 

For those who disagree, what exactly are you banking on to pump the market?

When I say bleak, I don’t necessarily mean full blown recession. Although I’m not sure of what recession catalyst couldn’t be shunted by fractional reserve banking and bailouts, I see a rather poor performance at least for the rest of this year, as well as next year. 

I can think of one item, and only one item that would have actual weight in improving business productivity, possibly at the cost of jobs however. Some of you probably already had this buzzword typed up a: AI

Before those of you who say AI is bs, “just a chatbot” ect, it’s coming, regardless of what you think. AI stocks like NVDA (yes by proxy), META, etc, are not what I’m talking about. I’m talking about low level, fresh out of college paper pushing jobs, even up to project management to an extent. AI will effectively optimize industries that require data organization, data entry, drafting up timelines, reports, repetitive remedial tasks etc. Do not confuse this with “ITS GONNA TAKE ALL OF YOUR JOBS” it’s going to improve the effectiveness of those who utilize it first in their respective industries. The HR industry could benefit from it to an extent, but only with intense moderation at first. This eventually will transform the type of jobs available, one of which will be something of the sort of AI moderators. AI are not capable of being autonomous by any means at this point of time but can be used to expedite many processes. But it’s not happening yet, I haven’t heard any news of any large firm implementing a trained model thats able to increase productivity by some wild metric.

Last Friday I bought 100x QQQ puts(see my previous post). I took 80% profit by end of day. This morning I close them all since we are oversold for the short term. Bought 4k shares of TQQQ this morning. I will probably close them out if we get a decent short term rally, or if we stay flat for a few days and RSI cools off even if I lose on TQQQ.

(Yes Ik GGN is global, just read the post)

https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/immediate-measures-to-increase-american-mineral-production/

For those who don’t like to click links, or read long winded explanations: 

Mango signed an EO to effectively give out permits to kickstart domestic mineral production in the US.


Longer winded discussion:

Here’s the hook, any of the NVDA regards who absolutely love AI and chips and gaming ect, by proxy love minerals. 

Minerals are paramount to the technology sector in pretty much every corner of the field. From military industrial, to domestic infrastructure,  computer chips, vehicles, batteries, other electrical components, all dependent on minerals. 


For everyone else who’s interested, the short term play(s) will be now, and on Monday. The executive order signed last week on Thursday 3/20/25 states 10 days after the date of the order, a list will be composed of current domestic mineral “producers” with operations to be expedited in any permits required to continue operations/ increase or start new operations. 

Personally, my watchlist is comprised mostly of pennystocks due to the nature of the current industry. What I mean by this is generally speaking we as a country (USA) have outsourced much of the industrialization of the modern world to other countries with cheaper exports. Yes there are domestic producers that are larger, I’m somewhat weary of the performance of these in the longer term. 

To preface, I currently hold no positions as of yet, however last Friday 2/21/25 to last Monday 2/24/25 I scalped a pennystock (that I’m not allowed to name) based on the EO news.

The only domestic non pennystock on my list is BHP, an elderly company that has the infrastructure to produce already. I’m not holding currently due to lacker performance as well as looking to not make a play until the list comes out on Sunday. The other play I’ve made is GGN which isn’t domestic, but still a hedge as tariffs could generally increase the price of gold anyways as it already has for copper. And GGN pays a sweet dividend. 

If anyone is interested in the mining watchlist I’ll be playing, just look up domestic lithium, the pebble property (largest known copper deposit), or look up battery grade graphite. These are all separate operations fyi. 

I’ve done DD but all of my favorite picks are literally pennystocks for the short term. And yet again, asides from BHP, pennystocks dependent on the executive order handing out permits to start production. 

Anyone who has some insight + non pennystock tickers feel free to comment. Thanks

I currently have a little under half my portfolio dumped into it (the rest is mostly sitting in cash) and will be buying out as much as I can, bit by bit, if it continues dropping.

I’ve got two pets, and we don’t currently have pet insurance for them. I’ve done a bit of research on Trupanion (TRUP), and while I’m still on the fence about their policies (they seem to up your rate regularly but that feels like it happens across the pet insurance industry annually)… I was wondering about a different approach: what if I just bought a share of Trupanion stock every month instead of paying for a policy?

Right now, their stock is trading around $38, which is not close to what a typical monthly premium might cost. My thinking is that if my pets stay healthy, I’m building equity in a company that stands to benefit from more people using pet insurance (which I genuinely feel will happen over time) — kind of like a self-funded safety net that grows with the industry. Worst case, I can sell the shares if I ever do face a big vet bill.

Curious if anyone else has thought this way for like a different service or product or has any perspective on this idea — either as an investing strategy or should I just get a legit pet insurance. Is this dumb as hell? A waste of time? Somewhere in between?

# 



**TLDR: This is an extremely high-risk play. I'm taking a degenerate, short-term bullish position on $QUBT and long-term short position on quantum computing stocks as a whole, with the anticipation of extremely volatile $QUBT price action soon.** 

Current Positions:

\- Short: mostly IONQ, with almost entirely put debit spreads

\- Degenerate short-term OTM calls: QUBT, rolling weekly



# Quantum Companies are Bad

I have returned after a couple years away to bring good tidings and some DD about a play I believe will have some extreme volatility in the coming two weeks. Over the past six or so months, quantum computing stocks have had a wild ride. Up 1200% down, [pimp slapped hard](https://qz.com/quantum-computing-stocks-nvidia-ceo-rigetti-dwave-ionq-1851771538), recovered some and currently teetering towards inevitable doom.

  
That's right. They are all doomed. Overvalued, overhyped and **running out of steam**. You don't need me to tell you that these companies are trash. Many big names have been trashing the industry, [Martin Shkreli](https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1895480382629556486) and [Kerrisdale Capital](https://www.kerrisdalecap.com/investments/ionq/) being two of the most notable.

# Why Do I Care about QUBT

While all of the quantum companies have little to show for their insane valuations, QUBT is a real gem. Despite missing last quarter's disappointing earnings of -$0.47/share (est. -$0.05) they maintain a respectable market cap of \~$1.1B while having nothing to sell. 



***IF YOU READ ANYTHING ON THIS POST, READ THIS PARAGRAPH.*** Per the [S-8 filed 3/21/2025](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758009/000101376225001115/ea0235205-s8_quantum.htm), insiders for $QUBT were recently approved to sell their shares. **Only two insiders stated immediate intent to sell stock by this coming Monday (3/31/2025).** As of 3/27/2025 only one insider has sold, with the Chairman of the Board[ Yuping Huang selling 200,000 out of his 27-million currently owned shares two days ago](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758009/000196858225000237/xsl144X01/primary_doc.xml). The other insider expressing intent is a director who only owns 207,000 shares. **Assuming the Chairman is done selling, insider dilution shouldn't be a near-term worry, but is always possible.** Currently, [multiple firms are suing the shit](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=8f5ad3653710c57c&rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS1129US1129&sxsrf=AHTn8zpwApo4bS8d-5dXiXB8EM1N_8SZgg:1743160180622&q=qubt+lawsuit&tbm=nws&source=lnms&fbs=ABzOT_CWdhQLP1FcmU5B0fn3xuWpmDtIGL1r84kuKz6yAcD_igefx-eKq1gCPHF3zhthFoneNn6lL83lY3KLybUMxCNDhMUtbCQQO9t_eGxoOP_s3rR9imLItfH1uBSfE1eodVtu3j9NNltXXuqTU0fP37mjBusR7Pi0GSAtMbdArRUTLOsC4dN4POVlfGKFb_2PiWfOtFnP-rmmP8j0Odsy8bbuGSebXg&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=2ahUKEwi74uja0ayMAxUCCnkGHfJkOOIQ0pQJegQIIRAB&biw=1718&bih=1304&dpr=1) out of this company. Any insider selling this close to the unlock would just accelerate the dumpster fire. 

As you can imagine, QUBT is being beaten down to oblivion. However, after scratching the surface it becomes apparent that there is ever mounting stress on QUBT short sellers. Below, I have a little spreadsheet w/ some relevant short data and some recent options flows depicting deep ITM call buying, which can be highly indicative of low liquidity.

>Barclays said on Thursday it favors fixed income investments over equities for the first time in ""several quarters"" and warned global economic growth was at risk due to U.S. President Donald Trump's escalating tariff policies.Despite hurdles such as rising prices and poor fiscal outlooks in Western economies, the risk to fixed income assets was less than to equities, Barclays analysts said in a note.



>We have been overweight global equities over fixed income for several quarters, even as valuations became stretched. But now, the policy risks strike us as tilted largely to the downside

My take on the news is pretty simple: Banks took way to long to get honest with their customers about how bad it would come. And american institutions probably won´t even yet, just out of fear of reprisals. Other - less kindly mannered people - may claim it is, because they want to suck up every possible dime out there, before the music stops.

1jllrah,wallstreetbets,"I believe that Coreweave is already underwater, and their IPO is an exit strategy for existing shareholders:","Coreweave is set to launch its IPO tomorrow at $40 per share. Its NVDIA backing sounds promising, but balance sheet constraints and shady collateral backing for massive loans can’t be brushed off.

Coreweave managed to skyrocket into the headlines over the past couple of years after solidifying its position as a significant AI player. This parabolic rise was, in part, thanks to a $2.3b loan collateralized by NVDIA GPUs. However, a simple google search of the collateral posted for this loan, Nvidia H100 tensor core gpu, will likely lead you to the same conclusion illustrated below.

When Coreweave secured an initial $2.3b in cash from investors, they posted NVDA chips as collateral. The rapid cash injection buoyed them onto the AI scene relatively quickly. However, that form of collateral has proven itself to be less than fundamentally sound over the past couple of years.
*Source: (https://www.reuters.com/technology/coreweave-raises-23-billion-debt-collateralized-by-nvidia-chips-2023-08-03/)*

When Coreweave posted the NVDA chips as collateral in 2023, the value was marked-to-market at ~$47,000/processor. That same processor is now worth 30% less. For context - their total loan value came in at a whopping $7.6 billion near the end of 2024. Simply put: technology is advancing quickly, and the collateral is rapidly degrading in value. Additionally, the cost to rent these GPUs is falling - why own the asset when you can rent it for 1/100th the price?

In December of 2024, Coreweave breached terms of their $7.6b loan through various ""unspecified"" actions and ""accidents"". However, their primary lender Blackstone was generous enough to waive these shortcomings and amend their loan.
*Source: (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1769628/000119312525044231/d899798dex1015.htm)*

Wildly enough, the cause of the near technical default was found to be due to an overstatement of collateral - Coreweave was alleged to not have tangibly held as many GPUs as they reported. The ""administrative accident"" was Coreweave attempting to sure-up it's reserves as to avoid defaulting on it's obligations.

That same company, ""backed"" by NVDA, will now IPO tomorrow. At $40 per share, the implied value is $19b. As it stands today, that $7.6b loan (that they nearly defaulted on 3 months ago) is nearly 1/2 of their entire market cap.

Just keep that in mind before smashing that buy button tomorrow after the buffer period.

The tariff rate/flat import tax for Canada and Mexico is 25%. ANYTHING coming from these two will have a import duty charge of +25%.

i couldnt find 2024 figures but gold imports in 2023:

128.40 Tonnes from Canada ($6.84B) and 36.8 tonnes from Mexico ($1.18B)

That's 165.2 tonnes imported from these two countries and the total US consumption for 2024 was 200 tonnes.

Per CNBC, More than 600 tons, or almost 20 million ounces of gold, has been transported into vaults in New York City since December last year. If retail, commercial and investment demand keeps up and the vaults start to run dry for delivery i think we see a huge spike in gold as demand outruns supply. Same situation with silver.

Europe
	•	Peugeot (France, Spain, Slovakia)
	•	Citroën (France, Spain, Slovakia)
	•	Opel/Vauxhall (Germany, UK, Poland)
	•	Fiat (Italy, Poland, Serbia, Turkey)
	•	Alfa Romeo (Italy)
	•	Maserati (Italy)
	•	Jeep (Italy - some models like the Avenger)

South America
	•	Fiat (Brazil, Argentina)
	•	Jeep (Brazil - Renegade, Compass, Commander)
	•	Peugeot & Citroën (Argentina, Brazil)

Asia
	•	Jeep (India, China - localized models)
	•	Peugeot (China, Malaysia)
	•	Citroën (China, India)
	•	Dongfeng-Peugeot-Citroën (China, under joint venture)

Stellantis has a strong presence in Europe due to its legacy brands (Fiat, Peugeot, Citroën, Opel) and also maintains production in emerging markets like Brazil and China.”

If they are already making Fiat and Jeep in Brazil(hint this is to avoid tariffs in Brazil) what’s to say they do not do the same in the US. I think of all of the car companies going through these tariffs and uncertainty stelantis are positioned well location wise, financially, debt wise and value wise.
-cash on hand is $34 billion
-assets $207b
-total debt $37b(has increased due to England location issues)
-market cap $44b(can almost buy the whole company outright with their cash on hand )
-sitting at a 6.18 P/E
-paying 13% dividend(24) has lowered to about 6% this year, I consider this a smart move (why give out larger dividends now vs taking on larger debt at interest if needed in future) this is a smarter use from managment with market uncertainty’s.

Alright degenerates, I did some real homework. Went back to 1928 and looked at every time the S&P 500 hit a fresh all-time high, then dropped 10% or more — a classic “correction.” Here's the TL;DR:

If SPX hits an ATH and then corrects -10%, but then bounces back up above that correction level, it always drops back down to 91% of the ATH (aka a -9% drawdown from the top) within 60 trading days.  
Doesn't matter how good the rebound looks. Doesn’t matter how hard Greenspan/Bernanke/Yellen/JPow flexes. It’s like gravity.

You get the point, they were ""unrightfully"" oversold.

So my theory is that it can, in a matters of month rebound to a price around 26-27 due to these :

1- oversold yet fundamentals are good

2- in case of uncertain and bearish market investor tend to like energy stock and you can see a rise in volume

3- they focus on domestic production wich can be boosted by the tax war, focus on april 2

4- 90% of reddit talk about Raw material or some goofy biotech with the 35th potential cure for cancer or whatever

5- insiders are stock pilling like crazy

Altogether 40 NVDA 5/16 110 csps and 30 NVDA 5/16 120 csps for a total of $35k premium. I picked the expiration to be one week before earnings so the premiums are not inflated by earnings and I would like to have the option to make another earnings play if the price is around $120.

After factoring in premiums, the average cost to purchase is $105 and $115 respectively. I picked $110 and $120 because NVDA’s lower range is around $110 and upper range is around $140, so in the worst case (of my) scenario, I would be purchasing NVDA at the lower end of the range. If I’m wrong, then NVDA is a good stock to hold long term.

I don’t need to bore anyone to list all of the reasons NVDA is a buy including exploding need and revenue from data centers; just beginning to scratch surface on AI in automobiles/partnership with AI companies; growing domestic revenue (47% 63B revenue) that won’t be impacted by AI restrictions…

Worst case scenario, NVDA tanks below $110 and I am forced to buy 7,000 more shares. In that case I will just hold on to a stock that I am confident will double in 5 years. Best case scenario for me is if the price remains in the 129 range and I will get to write puts again (6th time) and continue to collect premiums.

1jk5pp7,wallstreetbets,$AVXL - Alzheimer’s Drug that Actually Works - Pending EMA Approval,"
1. Introduction to Blarcamesine

Blarcamesine, also known as ANAVEX®2-73, is an investigational oral therapy developed by Anavex Life Sciences. It functions as an agonist of the sigma-1 (SIGMAR1) receptor and muscarinic receptors, aiming to restore cellular homeostasis disrupted in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.

**Additional reading:** https://www.sotcanalytics.com/

2. Clinical Trial Insights

A pivotal Phase 2b/3 randomized clinical trial evaluated blarcamesine’s efficacy in early Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients over 48 weeks. The results were promising:
	•	Cognitive Benefits: Blarcamesine significantly slowed clinical progression by 36.3% at 48 weeks, indicating a notable preservation of cognitive function.  ￼
	•	Safety Profile: The therapy demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with no significant neuroimaging adverse events reported.  ￼
	•	SIGMAR1 Wild-Type Subgroup Analysis: In a prespecified analysis focusing on patients with the common SIGMAR1 wild-type gene (excluding carriers of the mutated SIGMAR1 rs1800866 variant), blarcamesine exhibited an even greater clinical benefit. These patients experienced a 49.8% reduction in clinical progression at 48 weeks on the primary cognitive endpoint ADAS-Cog13. **This represents over 70% of the patient population.** 

These results were published in a peer reviewed journal article over 50 doctors/researchers  representing 42 external organizations: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2274580724006083

3. Market Potential


The Alzheimer’s therapeutics market is poised for substantial growth:
	•	Current and Projected Market Size: Valued at approximately $4.05 billion in 2022, the market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.99%, reaching around $15.19 billion by 2030.
	•	Valuation of Alzheimer’s Drugs: An FDA-approved Alzheimer’s drug can carry a market value of approximately $43.4 billion. For instance, Biogen’s Aducanumab was valued at this figure upon approval. Similarly, drugs in Phase 3 trials, like Eli Lilly’s Donanemab, have been valued around $20.2 billion, with potential increases upon receiving Breakthrough Therapy Designation.

**AVXL inexplicably has a market cap under $1B with over 25% of the float short**. If they even sniff the valuations argued here, we’re looking at a triple digit share price. 

https://ipwatchdog.com/2021/10/26/assessing-much-alzheimers-drug-worth/id=139154/

4. Investment Considerations

Investors should monitor:
	•	Regulatory Milestones: Blarcamesine has received EMA filing acceptance for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, marking a significant step toward potential market approval. **A decision should be made by the end of 2025** 

	•    Upcoming conference on April 5th which Anavex is expected to reveal additional subgroup analysis of their trial. 

5. Conclusion

Blarcamesine represents a compelling candidate in the Alzheimer’s therapeutics sector. Its innovative mechanism of action, coupled with favorable clinical trial results, positions it as a potential frontrunner in addressing a significant unmet medical need. Given the substantial market valuations observed with similar drugs, blarcamesine’s successful development and approval could yield considerable financial returns.

1jjt9qf,wallstreetbets,Stop buying $TSLA puts,"Hello Regard,

I have consistently been buying $TSLA puts every time it pumps and made decent money but guys, this time it's different. A 13% pump simply due to ""softer tariffs"" makes no sense. $NVDA and the SPY have not been moving like $TSLA this past week. Again, a sudden pump to +4% just before closing is very sus. They are somehow managing to trap the retail virgin. How can a stock skyrocket 13% literally after they announce that they lost 44% sales in Europe? When $INTC reported an 8b loss, it lost 30% valuation in 30 minutes. Intuitive Machine($LUNR) lost 50% valuation because they didn't land something on the moon, idk.

At 3:05PM I noticed a 12M BUY Volume on $TSLA on my Robinhood App. The same thing happened yesterday on closing, someone bought 2M stock. This is not retail investor, This is Elmo and 🥭 cooking up some massive scam which is going to completely cook the retail investor and us, WSB Put buyers. I have made good money buying $TSLA puts but today I have made the cumulative decision to stay away from them. 

Elmo is planning something big and our PUTS will be fucked. 

I felt that one of us must address this problem and warn the others about Elmo.",2025-03-25 20:22:12+00:00,4285,435
