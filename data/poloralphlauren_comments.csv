I can't remember the exact timelines, but I believe Polo Jeans Co products were always made by another company under license, and it ran from 1996 to 2006. And ""Chaps Ralph Lauren"" started in the late 1970s and was kept under the Ralph Lauren brand umbrella for quite a long time. Ralph's name was taken off of the Chaps tag some time in the 1990s. Then there was some confusing licensing arrangement started in 2020, and now it's technically ""a brand of Ralph Lauren Corporation"" according to the Chaps site but made under license, and Ralph's name is still not on the tag.",2025-04-04 17:53:13+00:00,3

They’re comfortable and I like the looks. Next for comfort would be the heritage aera suede’s. They’re pretty good for being on your feet. I haven’t done more than try the train 89s on but they do feel good, just not better than the heritage’s do initially. They could be better for all day. The ranger deck shoes aren’t my favorite, they’ve got an inner arch support thing that I’m not a huge fan of. The heritage courts I have not worn yet and just realized I ordered the wrong size when I went to check on all of this for you 🤦🏻‍♂️ lol so gonna have to get another pair of those I guess. Lastly I hated the Merton boat shoe. The sides were hard and hurt my feet. It may break in but I opted for sperrys instead, despite trying to do full polo outfits.

With multiple colors in the Hi Tech sweatsuit, the footwear should be neutral, like a pair of white on white  AF1’s, or Forces with a red, or blue swoosh would change the fit. The CP3 hat is from a different line, but if you could get the shirt that goes with that hat, you’d kilt it. Then you’ve got 2 whole fits.

There are only a handful of vendors who own selvage shuttle looms and almost all are in JP. The fabric itself is not inherently expensive compared to ""Made In Italy"" or other textiles alone, but there is no manufacturing license attached to purchasing their fabric..... so, this could very-well be just as good as any Nudie, LVC, RRL, or Jean Shop etc.  Higher quality would come in the thread count or oz. weight, weave pattern, dye process, surface treatment, or the yarn / fibers themselves.  Lastly, these compared to the same fabric used in a RRL jean would be the SPI, thread type, tolerance, finishing, etc.

You can almost guarantee that nobody would ever fake a selvage. The amount of wasted fabric from utilizing only a projectile loom's selvage edge would never be approved by any sales team.

The fact that it says ""CLASSIC SELVAGE"" may be worth researching.  That usually denotes a trademark of some sort.... like ""GENUINE LEATHER"" is not actually leather, it's a trademark of processed leather textile.",2025-03-23 06:51:27+00:00,1

I'd look at recent eBay listings that ended for fair value.... but I personally don't care about the monetary value, I care about iconic LoLife / LoHead collectors' pieces.  There were very specific pieces that were iconic to the LoLife community vs. something merely being sold during that era.

If you really really gotta move it, what we did was take as many pictures as possible wearing it before you move it as to document that you had it. Rock that shit all summer to the club, music festival, yur sister's baby shower, a car show..... make sure people know you had that shit in your closet before just passing it along to someone with big pockets who doesn't care.

In a way yes it smells 70s cause it smells old. Like if you're a young guy I'd probably sway towards polo red or red rush or something.

I deal with product values all day, every day. Upon comparing other SOLD shirts (authentic RL Polo Bear) those are the numbers. The rugby polos sell for double-triple that figure and the ones with more graphics go for 10-50% more. I rarely use opinion in business because opinions are like noses…..they all blow. I utilize proprietary software that looks at the same or very similar items of the same brand/manufacturer/product line across the 5 most popular platforms when providing value range.

The kerning in the lettering is correct, the jacket lining is quality material (optically) the tags ARE correct as someone who buys PL, RRL, and Polo exclusively.

1ipjltz,mcwf9d8,Routine-Inspector712,"If you really know so little about authentic PRL, and are still so ambitious about it, sadly you most probably have bought fakes as auths then.   
I will say it again, this is a typical fake, and has the same flaws every fake has: The inside labels are in wrong order, they do not start with the chinese labels. The composition label has a wrong font and it has ""Bangladesh"" written wrong and no mention about the lining. The neck tag has a wrong font, the QR code does not work as supposed to. It should not be directing you to the RL website, it should go to the authentication page and show you the item what it is supposed to be. The patch on the right pocket is crooked and the stiching is very bad. The stiching on the sleeves is bad. In addition, the Talon zippers means nothing, they are in these fakes as well.

1idtkg7,ma2q0r0,kylecole138,You’re talking to a Ralph nerd. Polo jeans company was licensed out for years and not actually manufactured by RL. They had to pay millions to buy back the name just to completely close the company. That’s why it’s kind of looked down upon by some collectors and in a lot of cases doesn’t hold the same value. RL is over 50 years old and has made thousands of jackets. This particular one isn’t very popular and your best bet would be to just image search it through google lens like i suggested or search vintage black quilted hooded PJC jacket like the other commenter suggested. Some pieces having nicknames because they are popular but this is not one of them so you’ll have to just search it by description. Looks like it was late 90s or early 2000s era. Good luck,2025-01-30 20:42:31+00:00,5

1ib6xur,m9ljwt4,AmphibianObvious7568,"Please ignore the people on here that are quick to jump the gun and call this item “fake”.
Ralph Lauren had an agreement with TJX (parent company of TJ MAXX, Bobs, Marshall’s) to sell  legitimate, REAL products. However, unlike the naysayers on here the products are in fact ALL LEGITIMATE but the overwhelming majority are seconds (slightly flawed), out of season stock or end of range from the main brands. Sometimes if you are lucky it’s excess stock of a live range where they made just too much of one particular design.
On most seconds they are  actually marked on the label .
A major retailer like TJX is not going to risk their CEO or other executive staff going to prison as well as tens of millions in fines and the bad publicity to put counterfeit merchandise in 4000 STORES. This would neither be worth it from a profit perspective nor a risk perspective.
Now, if you were purchasing on eBay or Posh that’s a different story",2025-01-28 06:46:41+00:00,1
1ib6xur,m9lk6lv,AmphibianObvious7568,They are not fake. People are very quick to act as experts without the appropriate knowledge. This is a Ralph Lauren “second” probably due to the logo not meeting QA standards. As someone with 30 years in this realm I can tell you that TJX will not risk imprisonment of one or more executive team members as well as millions in fines to make small profit margin in clothing,2025-01-28 06:49:10+00:00,4

The answers are fairly straightforward . This is a vintage RL pullover. Today the quality, including that of RL, has decreased whilst cost has surpassed the rate of inflation. As someone who has bought and sold used clothing for 35 years, RL is a brand that is trusted and respected. Those appear to be chocolate milk or chocolate milkshake stains. Easy removal. I buy shirts like this often when others take a hard pass. I, after inspecting for fabric degradation, authenticity, holes, rips, missing buttons, damaged zippers, enlarged button holes, factory defects, prior repairs, fading, dye bleeding and miscellaneous funk, can generally purchase the style, age, and brand of pullover pictured for 6 dollars or less. I’ll spend a total of 7-15 minutes on care/prep/sanitation. First I use a commercial sanitizing spray which not only kills germs/bacteria/dust mites but neutralizes scents built up from detergents/cologne . Then stain treatment, wash, and lastly  a quick ironing  to expedite the {hang} drying process Then, I sell it. Some resellers are lazy and quite frankly gross. I do not sell clothing that I have not personally cleaned and sanitized. I want the working folks who buy pre-owned RL from me to get as close as possible to the experience of buying a new piece in a RL store, which includes items being received “ready to wear”. The reason this is “worthwhile” is RL is an iconic American brand that appeals to different types of buyers. Those who: are looking for vintage clothing, appreciate RL,  appreciate the higher quality standards of yesteryear, wish to purchase name brand clothing affordably, want wardrobe staples that never go out of fashion (see photos of president Kennedy 5 years before RL started his clothing line. These pieces are always on style ).(Much easier with gentlemen’s fashion). I also enjoy salvaging things, not just clothing, and giving them new life. We live in a disposable society and fast fashion is now surpassing E waste as our primary refuse problem. I hope I have answered your question as to why “I” would buy that top.",2025-01-26 19:54:08+00:00,2

It seems that blue/silver is used still for some more exclusive clothes, and the blue/gold for the ‘normal’ items. I think the way the sizes are written down depends on the item being Polo store or Ralph Lauren Factory outlet + the location the item is made. But I could be wrong.

I’ve notice this, some have just the size, some have the number code thing like 175/92A and some have material information. The the size part is different, sometimes it’s just the size like S sometimes it’s S/P and sometimes it’s S/S or like LL or even XB  instead of XL.

There isn’t a single definitive collection of every label style used by Polo Ralph Lauren (PRL), but there are several resources and communities dedicated to helping people identify different variations, especially for authentication purposes.

Over the years, Ralph Lauren has used a variety of labels, especially on their classic lines like Polo Ralph Lauren, with changes in design, materials, and stitching, depending on the season, collection, and country of manufacture. Here are some of the most common label variations you may encounter:

1. **Classic Labels (Dark Blue/Silver and Dark Blue/Gold)**:
   - The dark blue with silver or gold labels are the most recognized and typically seen on higher-end Polo items.
   - The dark blue label with a silver Polo Ralph Lauren logo is often seen on earlier pieces, while the gold label is more recent.
   - These labels can sometimes have size information attached directly, or the size may be listed separately.

2. **QR Code Labels**:
   - These started appearing in more recent collections as part of an effort to enhance authenticity verification.
   - The QR code usually links to a website for more information about the product or authenticity checks.

3. **Size Labels**:
   - On some items, the size is incorporated into the main label, while on others, it might be a separate tag or even sewn into a different location like the side seam or near the care instructions.
   - Older labels often show just a letter (e.g., “M” or “L”), while newer labels may have full size information like “Medium” along with measurements.
   - Some items may feature additional details, like the country of origin or a specific collection line (e.g., “Polo Ralph Lauren American Classic”).

4. **Vintage Labels**:
   - Vintage pieces (especially from the ‘80s and ‘90s) may have variations such as the “Polo by Ralph Lauren” label, a single line of text with no other embellishments.
   - Items from this era may also feature size markings that are much simpler or sometimes handwritten in the case of more specific collections or custom orders.

### Resources for Verification:
- **Polo Ralph Lauren Authentication Forums**: Communities like the Reddit subforum r/PoloRalphLauren or online sneaker forums often feature threads dedicated to label identification.
- **The Ralph Lauren Archive**: While not a formal collection of labels, some archival pages feature label images and details.
- **Online Resale Platforms**: Sites like Grailed, eBay, and Poshmark feature many detailed listings, often with close-up pictures of the labels.

If you’re looking for a more comprehensive guide, you may have to rely on collecting images from various authenticated products over time, as no single database currently exists that documents all label variations.",2024-12-30 15:06:18+00:00,1
1hp41h7,m4fxeqj,L34N_T34RZ,Given the time I could probably send you a photo of the tags of all 80 or something polos I’ve had or owned for you to compare,2024-12-30 00:17:44+00:00,1
1hp41h7,m4ocepj,Ryzen_Octavian,"To be honest, that picture you've sent is enough, I saw an item that had a label like the first (top) image and I was confused because I hadn't seen one with just the sizing letter.
The whole S/SP thing really confused me because I bought a polo from TK Maxx in the men's section and it had the size SP but when I looked at RL's size guide the only ""SP"" size was listed in the women's guide... but I guess it just occours for any gendered clothing? I understand that it just means Small/Petit but that threw me off.",2024-12-31 11:00:41+00:00,1

1hn0fhr,m3y9hv8,TheGOPBlows77,"If it’s a white top and stain remover doesn’t do the trick I have my own methods (I sell vintage clothing). In the clothes detergent section at most stores they sell bleach tabs. On white clothing, moisten the stain with plain water, then take a bleach tab and hold it like you would a pencil or a pen, lightly rub the stain until it’s “bleached” out. This way you don’t cause any fading of tags or logo which would happen if you wash the entire pullover in bleach water. Works like a charm. Again, don’t rub the area too hard as you will cause the fabric to fray…..just enough to get the stain bleached out.

I lucked into an XXL back in October at 1 outlet and i've been to 5 other outlets and none of them even carried this jacket.

Also, seems like the outlets no longer carry mainly blemished or damaged items but rather past season's clothes at regular prices.  For example, the outlet sells the current chambray both thick and thin material versions for $128 and that's the same prices as the retail department stores for the exact same item.",2024-12-27 08:25:27+00:00,1

1hj44u4,m39f4ht,a-shoTO,"Comparing a mass produced outlet varsity to a stadium 92 windbreaker is delulu my man.

Pretty easy to tell it’s from the outlet based on the fact it has an outlet tag on it 😂 there’s also pretty well 0 items that were produced for outlets in the past 5 years that are market-value above MSRP. As soon as the mass produced outlet version hits stores best you’ll get is MSRP but likely much lower.

In case anyone wants it and wants to pay whatever OP originally paid, call your local outlet and see if they can find any stock in your size in the country (they’ll ship for free).

1hbu1l9,m1kjben,Burgerhil,I feel your pain .. That also drives me nuts .. The problem with Ralph’s collars is called Bacon Collar .. I only have that problem is with the cotton polo crew neck . It’s like wearing a expensive fruit of the loom colored undershirt with a pony on it .. So I started to buying the Jersey  material tees shirts which I don’t have  that problem and i have also noticed that the problem doesn’t happen on the stripped colored polo tees and the polo tees with big logo on it . I also have tried everything to calm that collar down but never found a remedy .. it must be in the collar cut of the tees that makes the collar curl up as the day goes on ..,2024-12-11 19:14:47+00:00,2

I’ve swapped all my hangers over to cedar over time. It wasn’t all at once, sure it ain’t cheap, but I finally did it. Bought ones that are wider in the shoulder area for suits too.

That being said, I plan on making an offer for a lower price so I'm not too worried as I like to put my clothes through the wringer and that seems like an ok price for me to do pick it up if I'm going to wear it around the house.

It's true that there is a listing for this on ebay for over $700. But that is \*not\* a realistic price. This is not one of the really rare items that will appreciate in value. This is from the Wimbledon collection that was available everywhere earlier this year.

And basic Polo RL cable-knit cricket/tennis sweaters in cotton tend to be priced at $298, including the one that has been at the PRL factory stores this year. So presumably this originally went for similar price... it's hard to tell since the original retailer listings from PRL, Macy's etc. are gone. But after being on the store shelves for a few months, it would go on sale to clear the shelves for the next season's product. And then on the secondhand market, the pricing should be \*lower\* than original msrp, not selling for over twice that amount as I mentioned above.",2024-11-14 23:38:02+00:00,3

If they sent a replacement for an item you first reported as ""not received,"" then it's possible that they did not charge you for the replacement. So in that case, no refund because no charge. Check the transactions on whatever card you used to make the order, on your bank/card account website.

Either way, when you sent the item back, did you include a packing list with the order number on it, within the box?",2025-04-23 17:10:24+00:00,1

1k0vsl2,mnhu6zv,United_Grapefruits,"Usually tags off mean you can't return it. However if it's in person and not far away you could try.

The shop might be feeing kind and let you swap it for the next size down. 

Online you would have to check return policy.  

RL have 30 days, but I wouldn't expect you could remove tags.

I'd wash it normally and see how it fits on you as it might shrink slightly during washing anyway. 

The warmer the wash the more chance it will shrink.
