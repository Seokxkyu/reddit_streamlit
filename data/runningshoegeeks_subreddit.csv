1jz7x8n,RunningShoeGeeks,New Balance 1080 V14 Fresh Foam,"Shoe Model & Size:
New Balance 1080 v14 Fresh Foam – Size 11.5 (Men’s)

Fit/Comfort Notes:
Fits true to size. Initially felt very tall and unstable compared to my previous shoes, but after a few runs, I adjusted quickly. Now they feel very cushioned and supportive—like running on a firm cloud.

Use Case:
Road running – daily runs, long runs, and some fartlek work.

Distance Ran:
Just passed the 30-mile mark.

Reason For Buying:
I’m a new runner (6’0”, 225 lbs, averaging 11:00 min/mile) training for a 5K. I started with Brooks Revel 7s, which I thought were a solid step up from the cheap $35 shoes I used to wear. After a few weeks, I developed top-of-foot pain that I self-diagnosed as extensor tendinitis. I decided it was time to get properly fitted.

Personal Observations:
The 1080 v14s have changed everything. Way more cushion and comfort than the Revels. I was hesitant at first due to the height and plush feel, but now I’m fully adjusted and loving them. The pain in my foot has completely gone away. They feel stable and smooth even on longer runs, and I’ve noticed less overall fatigue in my legs and feet.

Comparisons:
Compared to the Brooks Revel 7s, the 1080 v14s are in a completely different league. More cushion, better support, and overall better build quality. The Revels felt flat and harsh by comparison—and apparently, I’m not alone, since the shoe expert who fitted me called them “garbage” and was shocked they’d made it to a 7th version.

Final Thoughts:
If you’re a bigger runner or dealing with foot pain, don’t sleep on proper cushioning and a real shoe fitting. I regret not doing it sooner. The 1080s have completely changed my running experience",2025-04-14 19:40:14+00:00,73,16

1jyxzp4,RunningShoeGeeks,"ADIOS PRO 4 - 10K, HM & FULL MARATHON REVIEW","https://preview.redd.it/51bugjotqsue1.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1df93bb468cddf1fbca6771646057fe87b41c78e

The Good, The Bad & The Ugly.

ABOUT - 63 year old male. Started running in 2021 following a heart attack at 57...and because my dog refuses to walk.

Six marathons & 12 halves since October 2021.

5k 22.27 - 10k 45.50 - HM 1.36 - FM 3.23 (yesterday)

Midfoot striker - until yesterday!

I got these at the beginning of January and took them out for a shake out two weeks later - just a midweek steady run, which ended up with my 10k PB. Even taking into account a 30 second stop to adjust the laces.

I don't have solid 5 or 10k times, simply because I don't race these distances.

My second run was a HM in February - another PB. However, at this stage I experienced some fit/lockdown issues, which I don't appear to have fully resolved.

My third & fourth runs were long runs of 20 & 18 miles in the marathon training block - mainly to try and resolve the fit issue. I did go up half a size, and they are perfect length, but the problem seemed to be too much volume around the toes and tightening the laces caused a bit of bunching. Don't get me wrong, the fit is head & shoulders over the AP3, but I didn't feel overly confident unless I was really picking up the pace.

I resolved the issue by swapping out the insole with one from a NB Fresh Foam shoe - 1080 I think. Although this added 10g, it's not a major issue at my speeds. It was twice as thick, and the extra volume seemed to have worked. However, in the last 4/5 weeks I was getting hotspots on the balls of my feet no matter what shoe I was wearing. Getting a bit worried with the marathon coming up, I went through a regime of foot care creams and experiments with KT Blister tape for the balls of my feet - again, this seemed to work.

Yesterday was a whole world of difference though. I was cruising along at my 3.20 goal pace until about Mile 10 when I felt 'the blister' starting - on my sole at the heel. By halfway it was extremely painful, but still on pace, so I found that if I went to a forefoot strike I could cope with it. 18 miles, still on track, but realised I may not be able to hold the forefoot strike until the end.

Got through mile 23, but was beginning to drift back to midfoot & heel which was excrutiating - by this stage I was only about two seconds per mile off the pace and, although I still had plenty left in the legs I decided to just slow it down and make sure I PBed. Miles 24,25 & 26 I had to drop the pace, but try to run on my toes with a higher cadence (194 over the last three). Thankfully, the AP4 has that wonderful rocker which kept me moving forward - although I must have looked odd hobbling/tip-toeing up the final straight.

Finished with a 5min 40sec PB...and one monster blister. This is the first ever blister I've had. The size of a date or walnut - and, no, I am not going to post a picture for any of you foot fetishists out there.

The shoe performed fantastic though. No stability issues, even though the foam is ludicrously soft - feels more like the NB SC Elite V4, than the AP3. The early rocker keeps you rolling and weighs a lot less than the SC Elite.

The grip is every bit as good as the AP3 - one of my long runs was in the rain - so no issues for those intending to use them in Manchester. lol

Exactly 73 miles in these and the performance is just sweet. There is no wear at all on the outsole - although I'm 55k dripping wet.

You may want to swap out the laces - I intended to, but they haven't been an issue with me even with heel-lock lacing.

One of the shoe squeaks intermittently - but that's probably just one of the rods rubbing against the foam.

The shoe definitely comes alive at MP - although I've not had an issue at slower paces, it does feel a bit cumbersome around corners & turns.

The best thing though is, this morning I barely any aches. No quad DOMS which I've had on every marathon, and just a little ache around the lower Calf/Achilles area - but this is probably down to me having to run most of the race on my forefoot/toes. These shoes are like Radox/Epsom Salts for the legs

It's mostly Clint Eastwood, but has a smidgen of Lee Van Cleef. I think it was Eli Wallach who caused the blister.",2025-04-14 12:46:44+00:00,101,40

1jyh4jr,RunningShoeGeeks,On Cloudboom Zone - Review,"https://preview.redd.it/sdk178ezvnue1.jpg?width=2663&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fce29fe5044fe79d05806e42b6e8a6953eba0041

**Total distance ran:**

75km so far

**Type of runs:**

Longer runs/Interval sessions

**My profile:** 180cm/70kg

Paces: All the way from 4:45 to 3:35 min/km - average 4:30 min/km

Strike Type: Midfoot

80km per week

Recently picked up a pair of On Cloudboom Zone last month - hoping to use them for quicker tempo/speed training.

Initial impressions of the shoe were positive. They are very nice and lightweight. Believe they have around a 6mm drop. Aesthetically, I think they look great although I would maybe have preferred some other colour options beyond the white that is currently available. Materials I think are pretty nice. They are quite similar to the Cloudboom strike in terms of the foam and overall construction - although obviously not as minimal given they are training focused rather than race focused. The upper maybe lets the side down a bit - around the heel/ankle of the shoe is quite unforgiving and stiff and maybe my biggest problem area - not a lot of padding around the places where it could also be beneficial - but think this is done to keep the weight minimised. It is also maybe not the most breathable upper ever.

Being excited with my new running shoes arriving, made that age old error of unboxing and taking them outside for a quick spin. Initially thought the fit was fine and just a bit stiffer given the fact they were new but not really paying too much attention to it of I am being honest. As far as I am aware these shoes are only available from the On website (where I purchased mine) and in physical On stores. I opted here for the 43 as I currently have a pair of On Cloud Eclipse in 43 in rotation - which fit perfectly - and had seen a YouTube review recommending that they were true to size or to size down.

From my first runs, now up to around 75 km, including a mix of longer/quicker efforts, they are really responsive and bouncy - and think they are a great shoe for covering a wide range of paces.  Have tried them all the way down to 3:35/km for 3k reps and they felt super, especially great since they don't have a carbon plate - and can still emulate that kind of racier feel.

My main issue with the Cloudboom Zone is that they seem to be manufactured much too small in length (compared at least with my current Cloud Eclipse) - should have definitely taken at least an EU 44. It feels quite wide but not overly wide in the toebox, which is nice, but its much narrower and quite stiff in the heel and in the mid-foot up against the tongue padding. My foot is pretty crushed - and this really doesn't feel great at all - especially at the top end of the foot. The lacing system is not super either, not quite sure why they've given these shoes such bad laces. They come undone pretty easily and they are quite difficult to maintain any degree of tightness, especially the bottom half of the shoe, and maybe not long enough either if you want to use a runners knot. Across all of my runs so far, the upper consistently digs in underneath my ankles and given me some quite bad blistering/bleeding. Initially I just put this down to breaking in the shoes a bit, no problem I wanted to give it some time, but I think it's not something that's necessarily going to go away - with the shoe being too small (my fault) as well as just stiff/narrow at the ankle/heel with minimal padding.

Since my main issue is with the sizing - I would have normally just put this down to me being an idiot and buying/keeping the wrong size (expensive mistake given these shoes retail at €220.00/$210.00/£200.00). But what really irritated me is that it doesn't seem possible to even test/compare different sizes unless you are willing to order several pairs from On or visit an On store (which I don't live near). I tried to explain this to On about my sizing inconsistency issue - and they said I had 30 days to check the fit indoors at home before I decided to take them outside. Arguably fair - but super inconvenient - when this is the primary way I think people will purchase these shoes. Not sure why they exclusively sell them on their own website (but I would be interested to know if there was a reason behind it). They also had some other stupidly generic and unhelpful suggestions like trying them at a local retailer that sells On (Not possible for this model as far as I could work out) and also trying thicker socks (not really helpful either just due to the already snug fit), or even trying other models like the Cloudboom Strike - if I was ""seeking an alternative to the Cloudboom Zone that blends speed and comfort"".

Despite this I wouldn't write this shoe off just yet - think it's an exciting offering especially with how good it felt using it for intervals - a great bridge between something everyday and something raceday. Just think there's some real problematic inconsistencies in the sizing - which makes them very hard to recommend - although possibly this is resolved if they are available to test in local retailers. And more generally think the heel counter and laces could be improved to get a more comfortable fit. The price is also high compared to other manufacturers similar shoes - but I think that can often be the case with On's line up across the board and isn't necessarily specific to this model - so maybe another reason not to buy.

TLDR: Bought the On Cloudboom Zone, it's not possible to test these for size- as you can only order from On's website/physical stores. They feel too small and very uncomfortable in my normal size - for what should be a very nice tempo/interval shoe",2025-04-13 20:25:08+00:00,23,2

1jy4n3q,RunningShoeGeeks,"adidas Prime X 2 Strung - the king of bounce, my take after 400 km","How are you, my fellow runners?

I want to share my thoughts about adidas Prime X 2 Strung, which I nicknamed ""the king of bounce"". I already raced in them and I paid 270$ for a pair. I have to say it was worth it, even if now you can grab them at significant discounts. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask!

**Purpose**

I have retired my Novablast 4 so I needed a training shoe to prepare for my upcoming marathon in September. It will be my first marathon so I take it quite seriously but still with a big dose of joy.

**Fit**

Based on reviews, I bought a bigger size. Normally I wear size 44, and I went for 44 2/3. After the first runs I was left with corn on the top of my middle toes, both feet. I feel like the front of the shoe is squeezing my toes inwards. I have skinny, ectomorph, long feet. Egyptian shape.

I have changed the socks and I always use the polyamide/Dryarn® ones. I have also decided to use shoe trees. The problem disappeared. Still, I am left with a bit of room in the back of the shoe, they do not hug my feet like a sock. After a natural shoe break in and my interference, it seems like it is all good now.

**Usage**

I already did two races in them and currently, very slowly, I'm increasing the mileage from 50-60km per week, to around 75-100 km per week. These shoes are joyful and make my tempo/long runs feel much more tolerable. It is my main choice for every training unit now, but I'm thinking about buying some other more casual pair with lower drop for very, very slow running. I don't like doing the slowest units in Prime X 2 Strung. In some way I feel like the shoe is always forcing me to give more in order to compress and use the technology stuffed in it.

**Race debrief**

I took these shoes for a fun test in Bergamo. Two races one after another. 12,5 km night trail run on Saturday and a half-marathon on Sunday.

1. Yes I took the unstable, 50mm foam shoe for a trail run. Don't do it. I did it because I haven't got a pair for such events. I understand the mistake now and also the importance of the terrain awareness, and how it changes with the weather. Without prolonged rain it would be a different story. These shoes are not a good choice for any other terrain than flat road racing. End of story. It was raining and foggy. The ascents on paved roads and stones went pretty well and I had a lot of fun, but during slippery descents, on muddy sections I had to be so cautious that I actually forgot i'm running. It was pure survival. Questionable balance, no grip. Few times I was on the verge of twisting both ankles. I survived. Time to buy shoes especially for trail running.
2. With these shoes I have set my pb for half marathon, even running 12,5km the day before. My plan was to run it more recreationally, slower than my previous hm pb tempo which was around 4:47/km. In Bergamo, I ran my half marathon in 1:33:19 which is 4:25/km and was left shocked at how it happened. Literally I was blown away with the result because It wasn’t my goal or I didn’t feel like pushing. It just happened. I love how the shoes reciprocate the effort you give. When you are able to compress the foam, it is really giving. I felt so good and the fatigue appeared just at the very end. I feel like without running on the previous day I could be even faster!

**Longevity and materials used**

It is too early to judge, however I am very satisfied with the overall quality output I am receiving. From the top to the bottom, it feels like a top tier, and let's be real, better be a top tier for the value we are paying for an ultimate training/racing shoe.

**TL:DR**

Technological doping. Perfect for flat racing, long/tempo training. Not stable. Wrongly used, can cause injuries. Mainly for people with good mind-muscle connection and overall balance. If you compress them well, you will bounce like hell.

If you can grab it at a major discount for 200-220$. Go for it.",2025-04-13 10:27:11+00:00,193,56

1ju767a,RunningShoeGeeks,Adios Pro 4 initial thoughts + comparisons to the Pro 3 as well as other supershoes,"Not sure this sub needed another AP4 review at this point, but I wanted to get my thoughts out somewhere and Strava wasn't the place to do it, so here we are...

**Profile**: M22 176 cm, 57 kg former college runner, forefoot striker. Fairly noticeable pronation on right foot.

Average weekly volume around 100 to 115 km in peak weeks, though currently rebuilding from injury so hovering around 70 to 80km

**Relevant PBs**: 15:27 5k, 34:30 10k, 1:18 HM (yeah, I know, the longer ones are overdue to be broken)

**Context**: I've been running competitively for several years now, but only really got into the world of running shoes in 2024. Not for lack of geekiness, but lack of occasion, and opportunity, perhaps. This year, I spent far more on running shoes than I should have... enough to make my family and friends sigh in exasperation at the number of packages delivered to our house. 

In my defense, I always tell them that I'm simply stocking up for the next three years in advance. As I say that, I think I hear another delivery at the door.... ahem. Well, I can say that at least I got these Pro 4s for a very good deal, $150 USD incl. tax and shipping off of Mercari. 

As someone who's traditionally stuck to Saucony and Nike, Adidas has definitely earned my love this year with their lineup and I see myself continuing to follow their releases with interest from now on.

So, onto the actual review, let's see.

**Type of run**: 3km warmup @ 4:35 / km, 8 x 1km sub threshold @ 3:35 km, 3km cooldown

Immediately, I felt that the upper and fit was much better than the AP3. As I was expecting from all the numerous reviews I'd read, it was much more comfortable and I had no issues with slippage. The Pro 3s gave me endless issues with the lockdown, even after trying heel lock lacing and replacing the laces. I even tried using speed laces with them, but felt that I had to tie them so tight that it gave me pressure and lace bite, so  I gave up on that setup. 

However, I should mention that unlike most people who had to go a half size up from the 3 to 4, I have narrow feet and sit in between sizes (42.5 and 43 EU) in every brand except for Saucony. So it's rather likely that my lockdown issues stemmed at least partially from a width and length discrepancy in addition to the poor lacing.

The Pro 3 also gave me persistent issues in aggravating my posterior tibial tendonitis. I haven't been able to use them consistently until recently after a few weeks of strength work, but still I find myself a bit reluctant to reach for them. I will say the only reason why I kept giving them a chance is precisely because I enjoyed how responsive the ride felt.

With that being said, I was surprised to find out that the Pro 4 did not give me the same issue despite many people indicating a relative decrease in stability. The difference in softness was quite apparent at first step in, and only became even more clear as the run went on. I was very pleased with how at home they felt even on my warmup, as opposed to the 3 which felt a bit awkward and harsh at anything slower than 4:20 km pace.

While the 4 definitely feels somewhat less punchier than the 3, which I would describe as stepping off of a catapult with each stride, I don't necessarily think it's a bad thing. The 4 gave me a very smooth ride that felt effortless and seamless on the intervals. Despite feeling like I was not going faster, I was hitting faster pace on each rep.

**Disclaimer:** I have not run a full marathon yet, but I can definitely imagine that ""disappearing on the foot feel"" and more forgiving ride would be greatly appreciated in the latter stages of the race as you begin to fatigue. I've learned that sometimes what you need is not to be distracted by the shoe.

**Some comparisons to other supershoes I've tried:**

Vaporfly 2 ‐ A timeless supershoe, also the first one I've ever tried. I still feel I'd prefer the Vaporfly for anything approaching 10km to 5km race pace, as it's fairly more propulsive. 

In a HM, I'm not sure which I would pick, the verdict is out on that one. I do think the Pro 4 is slightly more forgiving, more natural feeling, as I don't like how the Vaporfly 'sinks' a bit into the ground before rebounding, the squishiness still feels unnatural to me after having done many workouts and races in it. The Pro 4 is also definitely better around the turns no question, and likely better in terms of traction, though I haven't tested that.

Alphafly 1 ‐ The OG Alpha. A crazy wild and fun ride that's hard to beat for any shoe past and present. The AF1 wins in terms of pure fun, but in terms of performance I'd say they're very comparable. 

Alphafly 3 ‐ I see the AF3 as being the more firm counterpart to the AP4. Not nearly as fun as AF1, but provides a well cushioned ride that helps you lock into a rhythm and endlessly maintain it. I think I'd reach for the AP4 before these as they feel slightly less clunky.

Endorphin Elite ‐ Most aggressive supershoe I've tried by far. I genuinely felt like I wasn't fast enough to even be using it... honestly can't see myself using these for a half. If you can put a lot of force into these, you get a lot back. But it's not gonna do the work for you.

Endorphin Pro 3 ‐ The Pro 3 is a great workout shoe and feels more nimble, more snappy, more firm. I quite like these for short intervals. I wouldn't pick them in any race distance over the AP4 except a road mile maybe?

Endorphin Pro 4 ‐ A lot of people joke about how the EP4s are basically super trainers and honestly, yeah. But they do fulfill that role pretty well, so I'm happy to use them as such grabbing them on steep discount. They're great for steady continuous efforts like a progressive long run, or hill repeats. Race day though? AP4 no question, of course.

Cloudboom Strike ‐ Pretty similar in terms of softness underfoot I feel. The Speedboard gives it a more aggressive transition to toe off which is something I like, but I think it's slightly held back by the rocker. It's a solid, fun shoe, and seems to be somewhat in between an aggressive and more relaxed shoe, whereas the AP4 seems to hit a better sweetspot in that regard.

**Final thoughts:**

Well, if you made it this far, I wanna say thanks for reading through all my walls of text. Honestly a part of me wants to start racing marathons to justify all the marathon shoes I have on my rack. Unfortunately, I know that I still have plenty of unfinished business on the track and in the shorter distances. 

However, when the time comes for me to tackle the marathon, I think the Pro 4 is definitely amongst my top options for doing so. It's a great shoe. I wouldn't say it's an absolute must have if any of the other top racers on the market work for you, but then again I guess you could say that for any shoe nowadays. Still, it's a worthy addition for anyone who likes softer, comfortable, forgiving yet fast racing shoes and especially if you've found that Adidas works for you.

1jtrorp,RunningShoeGeeks,Li-Ning Feidian 5 Elite,"About me: 100 kg, run 35-40 km pr week and am mostly a midfoot striker. Half Marathon time of 1:48

After circling around these shoes for a good amount of time, I finally swiped the card, when Aliexpress had the march super sale. I ended up paying 150€ with all taxes and free delivery to Europe. They arrived last Friday, and what better way to try them, than taking them with me to run Berlin Half Marathon.

The fit: I have purchased Li-Ning shoes before, so I knew they would fit me. I use 44,5 in Li-Ning, Adidas and Brooks, with an average footwidth. The toe box feels wide, so I don't think sizing up is needed if you have a slightly wide foot - but Li-Ning has a great sizing guide on Aliexpress to use.

Upper material: The upper is made by a woven nylon mesh, which has a slight soft feel on the inside, and the outside feels more like a classic woven polyester. It's a thin shoe, so it's best used for warmer races. At cold temperatures, the wind will blow straight through it.

Now onto the more interesting stuff. The shoes drop is supposedly 5 mm, with a stack of 38mm and a forefoot of 33 mm. I have ran in everything from 10 to 4 mm drop, but I will say the drop doesn't feel super aggressive. The midsole is made by Li-Nings own Boom Foam, in a new revision called Super Boom. It has a distinct squeezing feeling, and walking in it gives a clear indication of the rebounce from this shoe. The carbon plate is a full plate made from T1000 carbon. The outsole is nothing special. It's grippy enough, and I didn't feel any risk of slipping. I wouldn't trust it with my life in rain, but I wouldn't be scared of running on wet tarmac.

The run: Trying a brand new pair of shoes at a competition is probably not the smartest, but I thought what the heck. The worst would be a couple of blisters and a slower time. But it turned out to be an amazing experience. This is my first ever proper pair of supershoes, so I don't have much to compare with. The rocker was solid, and early I could feel how the springyness of the midsole kicked back the energy put into it. 

I started out running 5:15 min/km, and at that speed, the shoe didn't feel super stable. There's not a lot of lateral stability, so you need to land midfoot and forward. When we upped the speed to 5:05, the shoe improved, and despite being a supershoe, it was perfectly stable, even at my modest speed. The last 3 km, I increased to 4:45, and at that point the rocker and stability became more pronounced. This shoe will definitly perform better, once you get above a certain threshold - one I suspect is around 4:30-4:20 min/km.

Last mentions: I chatted with a few Chinese shoe youtubers, and they said the Feidian 5 Elite is a bit hard in the sole. Now I weigh 100 kg, and have no prior experience  but for me that wasn't an issue. But if you're a light runner, it might be worth taking into account.

Overall it was a 10/10 shoe experience, and Im glad I took the gamble. The shoe is amazing value, and I have no problems recommending it to others.

1jtj2ys,RunningShoeGeeks,33 shoes tested for Energy Return and Energy Absorbed (Cushioning),"Measured using a linear electrodynamic actuator producing a sinusoidal force at 2Hz with an amplitude of 900N. Note that these measurements are sensitive to the different parameters of the test.

For heel, it is measured at 12% from the back. For forefoot,  65%.

Full table here: https://www.rtings.com/running-shoes/tools/table/163923

Regarding the choice of 900N, total force is around 2-3x body weight so higher than 900N. However, that force is spread across the foot and the way our measurement is done is only in one smaller area of the foot at a time, hence the lower values.

1jt1cxv,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Cielo X1 and Hoka Cielo X1 2.0 comparison,"Hoka Cielo X1 (2024)

US13

Fit/Comfort Notes: True to size. Advertised as narrow, but actually fits wider than most Hokas. The upper is stiff and not the most comfortable. Lockdown is decent, but the stock laces are bad. Overall, not a plush fit, but secure enough for long efforts.

Use Case: Used primarily for races: half-marathons and a full Ironman marathon. Also tested on long road runs (20+ km).

Distance Ran: ~350 km (~217 miles)

Reason For Buying: Looking for a race-legal shoe with high cushioning and stability for long-course triathlon. Switched from Nike after being disappointed by Vaporfly (too unstable, narrow platform) and Invincible 3 (heel slippage, uncomfortable upper).

Personal Observations:

One of the most cushioned racing shoes available – extremely protective even at 110+ kg (240+ lbs). Aggressive rocker helps maintain turnover late into long efforts. Solid stability and support over long distances, especially post biking in Ironman. Outsole durability is excellent – full rubber coverage except for a strange bare section on the back heel.

Downsides: stiff upper, subpar laces, and the fit is wider than expected. Weight is higher than typical super shoes, but irrelevant at my body weight – the overall support more than compensates.

Comparisons: Far more supportive than Vaporfly/Alphafly for mid-pack and heavier runners. I trained mostly in Asics Superblast 2, which complemented it well (but those aren’t Ironman legal). Cielo X1 was my go-to race shoe for 2024.

Hoka Cielo X1 2.0 (2025)

US13

Fit/Comfort Notes: True to size. Massive improvement in the upper: better heel structure, more breathable, and slightly narrower – now it actually fits like a modern race shoe. Laces are traditional and work better. Still roomy for a super shoe, but much improved over v1.

Use Case: Used for tempo runs

Distance Ran: ~21 km (~13 miles)

Reason For Buying: Was excited about the updated version hoping for same midsole performance with improved fit and comfort. Looked like a perfect evolution on paper.

Personal Observations:

Upper changes are great – fit and lockdown issues from v1 are solved. Unfortunately, the midsole took a hit. Foam under the heel has been reduced both in width and volume, and outsole cuts are much deeper. This causes instability in the heel – noticeable even during walking. During runs, it forces a midfoot/forefoot strike, which I can manage up to ~15 km, but after that my form degrades and I rely more on my heel – something v1 handled much better. I don’t trust v2 over longer distances or during the Ironman marathon. My concerns were confirmed by several YouTube reviewers (lighter runners too), who also noted instability. One key design change was moving the midsole cut from lateral to medial side – similar to Adios Pro 3. The difference is that Adios has a stiffer heel and isn’t as prone to compression. For me (slight supinator), the change might help theoretically, but the execution doesn’t work at heavier weight.

Comparisons: Cielo X1 2.0 feels like a different shoe altogether. Better fit, worse stability. Compared to v1, it’s less suited for heavy runners or fatigued form. I chose to return it and stick with Mach X2 for training and Cielo X1 for racing. It’s a shame the original wasn’t kept in the lineup alongside X1 2.0 and Rocket ",2025-04-06 18:48:49+00:00,104,32

1jsj561,RunningShoeGeeks,Superblast 2 @ 1000km. I was wrong about these shoes,"Me: 189cm/6ft2 75kg Mar 2:56 HM 1:18

Shoes from last 12 months: New Balance 880, Endorphin Speed 4, Boston 12, Vaporfly 3

Despite the instant-classic status of these shoes, I couldn’t find a 1000km+ review of them, so I figured I’d do my part, especially since my opinion on them has completely changed.

I bought these shoes for Marathon training, with a specific eye on something that would allow me to build some speed work into my long runs.

My first impression was a mix of “I don’t see what all the fuss is about”, and “I can’t believe I just paid so much money for a pair of shoes”.  

I absolutely adore the foam on my VF3’s, and in my mind I was expecting something similar from the SB2’s - somewhat soft but with a nice rocker and extremely propulsive, leading to that feeling of just wanting to run more and faster.

In reality the SB2 just felt too firm to create any propulsive ride, and without much of a rocker, I was left with the impression of slamming two giant slabs of foam into the ground. There was definitely a better return than the 880s, but overall I felt like I had a shoe that was neither nimble enough for speed work, nor supportive enough to keep my feet/joints happy on 35km+ runs.

On positive initial impression was that the shoes were *extremely* comfortable around the foot. I went up half a size to a 12.5, which I’m not sure was necessary but definitely didn’t hurt. Something I’ve struggled with in previous shoes is that when the upper felt breathable like the VF3 or Boston 12s, it didn’t feel like it conformed particularly well, where the upper on my New Balance 880s fit well, but immediately made my feet overheat. The SB2s had the best of both worlds, and also conformed to my foot arch nicely.

In general though underwhelment (new word!) was to the point that I actually looked into whether I hae a fake pair (I didn’t). But I also couldn’t return them so I was going to make damn sure I got my value out of such a large expense.

So I persisted, using them for long and easy/recovery runs since there was nothing else in my rotation to fill that space. At least it gave me plenty of opportunity to tell anyone who would listen to me how overrated the SB2’s were.

At 250km of usage I noticed something strange. Normally on a long run at around 30km my feet and legs begin to really feel the fatigue, and my run gait transitions from a “bounce” to more of a “shuffle”. For whatever reason (maybe they’d worn in a bit, maybe I’d adapted), this wasn’t happening with the SB2s - while that propulsive pop wasn’t as pronounced, it didn’t seem to diminish as the miles ticked over, and I finished my long runs feeling like I’d put far less stress on my feet.

Around the same time I had another unexpected occurrence, when I found myself at an unplanned speedwork session with only my SB2s (normally I’d be in the VF3s or Speed 4s). To my surprise I put down my first ever sub 3min kilometre, without particularly trying for it. To be clear, they’re definitely not as fast as my speed workout specific shoes, but it made me realise that if I wanted to put real pace on the SB2’s I could.

Somewhere along the last 250km, the Superblast 2s had transitioned from a shoe that couldn’t really do anything particularly well, to a shoe that I now felt excited to use for basically any workout. 

They have remained that way for the next 800km. They've held up freakishly well, and are in better condition than my Endorphin Speed 4s that have about 1/3rd the distance on them. I’ve now got 1100km on the shoes, and no immediate plans to replace them - while they’re lacking perhaps some of that 250km magic, I can still take them out on the weekends and feel like I can do a good long session without worrying about causing damage to my feet.

Perhaps the icing on the cake came about a fortnight ago. After a hard long run in my VF3s in preparation for a marathon, I caused some muscle damage in my right foot (“peroneal tenosynovitis”, whatever that is) due to inadequate rest the next day and wearing a pair of Adidas Stan Smiths around the city. A panicked trip to the physio resulted in the advice “you’ll probably be fine to race, but put your Stan Smiths away until after the marathon, and even when you’re not running, you need to wear the most supportive comfortable shoe you can find, which may be a plated shoe, or maybe your Superblast 2s, you’ll need to work that out with trial and error”.

So as you may be able to guess by now, after a pretty extensive wash to get them as white as possible, my SB2s are now getting worn around the office, at least until my foot fully recovers.

Summary: 250km of being underwhelmed, 800km+ of the greatest shoe I’ve ever owned.",2025-04-06 01:40:03+00:00,632,98

**Me:** 27 6'2 , 180lb, midfoot/forefoot striker. HM: 1:48, Pace: around 8:30

Other shoes: Brooks Glycerin 21 GTS, Asics Novablast 4 TR

This shoe has been talked about every which way to sunday so I'm not guna talk about any specs. Just my thoughts.

**Some Context:** I've been running (properly) for the last 2 years now, and I'm trying to find another pair of running shoes for myself. It's not really a surprise to me that Im getting a little too wrapped up in it, I figure whatever motivates me to keep going out and get miles is a positive thing. I'm looking to build a well rounded rotation. As I start training for my first marathon in November, I'm looking for a daily trainer that I can put the long miles on, while still having some pace. I have a shoe for some recovery mileage (Brooks Glycerin), and I have my eyes set on a shoe coming out soon for some tempo/speed work (Boston 13, hoping these tariffs don't royally screw me).

Currently, for a trainer, I have the Asics Novablast 4, TR version, which I quite like, and is what I ran my fastest half marathon in. I just would like a non ""trail"" shoe so I can feel a little more connected to the road, and doesn't have quite the aggressive grip that the TR version has. I wouldn't say they are proper trail shoes, but they are more aggressive then normal. I managed to find a pair of the normal ones in my size yesterday, It seems like the old stock of them is getting bought up.

**The Shoe:** Boy these things are soft. But soft doesn't always mean better. I immediately noticed that these things absorbed rocks/bricks/changing terrain with ease, which helps with some confidence when running on streets. As I got to the proper trail, These things really want to pick up the pace. It's obviously not a plate shoe, but they foam feels like it's actually working when you get on it. I'm not a fast runner, these seem like they would really accel at a 7-7:30 pace (or faster), I'm more of a 8-8:30 pace *for now.* When I tried to slow down a bit, these shoes really were not happy, I started to notice them more. And I've always thought that the best shoes are the ones you don't notice.

These things have a little like ball of foam in the center of the foot, which is supposed to act as like a ""trampoline"" like effect, It's not bothersome, but you notice it. I wouldn't say that it really propels me forward though. But I also didn't notice it as much in the 4's  
When I said these things are soft, They are, but almost too much so for me, I notice that I start to pronate a little. When I start to get a little fatigued my foot starts to crash inwards a bit (pronation)  
It's been documented that the 4's are a little more stiff then the 5's, I have a pair of the regular 4's coming in, so I wana see if I still feel the same pronation thing, I didn't notice it before in my TR versions.

I also had some issues with corners, because of the softness, I felt some ankle instability when I tried to hit some sharper corners. Which really gave me some confidence issues at some sharper turns. It's possible it's just me, I just ran the half marathon on Sunday, and then did 10 miles on Thursday, (today being Saturday) So I'm definitely not at 100%.

Some other concerns I have with the 5, is that some people have already noticed that after 100 miles or so, these shoes loose their bounce. I know it's normal for a shoe to fall flat eventually, but that quickly is worrisome, and If these shoes lost their bounce I don't know if i'd reach for them tbh. I've got probably close to 100 on my 4's and I haven't noticed any life loss in them.

So where from here? As mentioned I have a pair of 4's coming in this week I'm going to try, and If I don't notice the pronation issue, I'm likely going to keep those and send these back. (crucify me for the waste I know but blame amazon for being so forgiving) , On top of that I have a pair of Superblast 2 coming in as well, I'm curious to try those out as there seems to be a love it or absolutely hate it mindset around them. My hope is that if I like those, they will become my long run shoe, and possibly the shoe I do my first marathon in.

I'm hoping to get a pair of the Boston 13's when they release too, I want to try something with rods/plate, see if it helps me with some speed, and if they are comfortable enough on a long run, I might choose those for the marathon instead. I've got some time till then so I'll figure it out.

All of this has just gotten me excited to get out there and get some miles on, so I figure that can't be a bad thing at the end of it all. I'm happy to field any questions and hear any suggestions that might be there.",2025-04-05 23:28:10+00:00,54,28
1jsddmf,RunningShoeGeeks,Veloci Ascent at 200 miles,"Me: 190lb, 15miles per week, average run: 3 miles 

I’m a couple of hundred miles into my first pair of Veloci running shoes. Below some thoughts:

Impressed overall. For a first release shoe, this is extremely competitive and my feet are already lobbying me to give up my prior regular runners (which I’d been loyal to for a decade).

Pros:
* Wide Toe Box: this shoe feels good because it is actually shaped like my foot. I think the broad toe box is my favorite element of the shoe.
* Heel Drop: I use orthotics to prevent shin splints and so I just put these into the Veloci shoe and haven’t felt any undue tightness in my lower leg.
* Cushioning: I am a plodder rather than a fast runner, but I’ve felt like the ride hasn’t deteriorated since I broke open the box. 200 miles and counting over 3 months of regular use.

Cons:
* Heel tab: I have fat fingers so I don’t really use the heel tab to put the shoes on, but the tab itself feels a bit tight when I did try it.
* Wear and tear: I tend to scuff a particular part of the outer heel area of the outer sole. This is no different on this shoe vs previous daily runners, but I have noticed a bit of wearing down on the edge. To me, the stability is unaffected and overall cushioning still OK for my level of weekly usage.

IMHO, the Veloci Ascent is a terrific shoe. I am no pro but I’ve not had any sore feet or lower leg issues since starting with them. Price point at $170 is to be expected and actually pretty reasonable for a good shoe with plenty of miles to run.

I’ll renew my purchase. Eventually!",2025-04-05 20:52:33+00:00,46,11
1jscwwi,RunningShoeGeeks,Zoom Fly 6 @300km,"**Me:** 5'9, 130lb, midfoot/heel striker. Easy pace: 5:15-6:00/km, HMP: 4:05/km, 5kP: 3:50/km

**Other Shoes:** Magnify Nitro 2 (8.5M), MS Sky Paris (8.5M), Norda 001 (9M)

[https://imgur.com/a/slHwKqd](https://imgur.com/a/slHwKqd)

I purchased the Zoom Fly (ZF6) as my first ever speed/tempo shoe. I started running in the winter of 2024 and did everything, including track workouts, in a single pair of NB 1080s. My only other experience with plated shoes is 60km in my race shoes. I purchased a W10US (M8.5US) and it fits perfectly. The toebox feels narrower than average but the overall fit is snug and secure. I had no blisters or hotspots at any point. The laces are a little short.

I've worn these shoes for every sort of run now: track, easy, tempo, and long run workouts. Like other people have said, the shoes are great at any pace but really shine the faster you go. When I travel I only pack the ZF6 since it can tackle any sort of road run. 

The foam is responsive and the shoe feels great as my strides lengthen at faster paces. At slower paces the foam has a squishier feel and actually feels a little less stable than at faster paces, probably because I'm spending more time on my rear foot. The overall running experience is amazing, but it (obviously) lacks the lightness and bounce of a race day shoe. 

The sole is pretty durable. After 300km on surfaces including gravel, packed snow and warm ice, there's barely been any wear. As you can see in the photos the little nubs on the outer heel and forefoot have worn off but everything else is intact. The design of the sole allows for mud and gravel to be easily trapped between the grooves.

The upper has no signs of functional wear; the translucent plasticky outer layer has outstanding durability and honestly feels like my norda's Dyneema upper.  I'm not sure about the longevity of ZoomX foam, but given my weight and the shoe's durability I think i could easily double and perhaps even triple my current mileage before replacing it.

I haven't tried many shoes, but the ZF6 ticks all the boxes for an average runner like myself. At $225 CAD, I feel that it provides excellent value as a carbon plated, do it all supertrainer.",2025-04-05 20:32:02+00:00,59,13
1jsbos0,RunningShoeGeeks,Brooks Glycerin Max @ 500km,"After half an autumn, a full winter, and a couple of weeks of spring, my Glycerin Max have reached 500km. I bought them to replace some Boston 11s which I absolutely hated, in the hopes of just eating up the long and easy miles, and maybe getting away with them on tempo runs if I could (I couldn’t).

There doesn’t seem to be any long-term views of these on here, so I thought I’d post mine.

33M, 67kg, 5:00-5:15/km easy pace.

Overall: For easy and recovery runs, I’ve found it to be a great shoe for me. Yes it’s a bit of a chonk, but for just sitting back into easy pace and taking long runs, or shorter recovery runs it works almost perfectly. Longest run in these was 28km, and they were perfectly comfortable with no hotspots and no dead legs the next day. I could maybe see the midsole working a little better for me if I was a bit heavier, but I find it’s a pretty decent balance between plush absorption and enough firmness to get some responsiveness back.

However, I don’t feel like I can get any decent tempo out of these. I’ve done a few long progression runs in them, and once it starts getting into the 4:20-4:30/km range they feel like a slog. For tempos, I’ll usually use my Rebel V4s, although I dislike them and am desperate for them to get to a point where I can feel less guilty about binning them.

In terms of quality, these have been battered by a UK winter and have held up really well.

Stability and traction are spot on.

After 500km, these still feel like they have a lot left to give. Which is great as I want to keep them in my rotation for a lot longer.

Upper: Always got good comfort out of them. The tongue is well cushioned. Of course it’s thick and therefore on the heavier and warmer side, but it’s taken a battering from weather and still looks good. The blue staining is from putting in some kitchen paper in order to dry them out quickly after a heavy downpour run.

Midsole: Does exactly what I got it for and still feels great at 500km. As mentioned above, anything at tempo I don’t find that this works for me. The shoe is super stable underfoot and the rocker shaping does keep things moving.

Outsole: Always had great traction, and, as can be seen, the outsole has barely worn across the 500km. Compared to my VF3s where the outsole disintegrated after about 250km. ",2025-04-05 19:38:06+00:00,152,46

1js069d,RunningShoeGeeks,BBC looks at what tariffs might do to the sports shoe market,"The article focusses on Nike, and their recent struggles to sustain a decent market share, but I thought it was an interesting look at the market overall. Most of Nike and Adidas' manufacturing happens in Asia (China, Vietnam) - is that also the case for the likes of Hoka and Saucony? 

They interviewed the creator of Sole Review who said companies might opt to use more EVA in their shoes (presumably the core models rather than racing lines!) or only cycle their shoes every 3-4 years rather than 1-2 years.

1jqb3eq,RunningShoeGeeks,Saucony Endorphin Elite 2 - First run impressions,"Hi all,

I just returned from my first run with the Saucony Endorphin Elite 2. I feel a bit different about this shoe than a lot of the (paid) online reviews in a couple of ways. That's why I wanted to share my thoughts.

Some stats: 174cm, 70kg, higher cadence running style, reasonably fast (recent 10K PB of 38:XX).

Currently searching for my shoe for a fall marathon with a sub-3 as my goal. The only other supershoe I own is the HOKA Rocket X 2, which I love, but can't picture wearing for a full marathon.

Upper:

I tried my usual EU size 42 in the store but immediately felt the need to go up half a size as many others do. I bought the 42,5 and get a good lockdown in it even without lace lock. There is some wrinkling of the tongue, but it doesn't matter much. The upper feels nice and airy, good stuff so far.

Outsole:

The outsole got criticized by some online reviews. But in dry conditions, I found it to be pretty fucking great. The rubber is scarce, but very sticky.

I haven't tried it in wet conditions, which is supposed to be its weak spot. So the jury is still out here.

Midsole:

That's why you're all here for, right? And boy oh boy, is this shoe different... You all saw the videos and there's no way around it: This shoe is squishy as hell and that comes with upsides and downsides.

When walking in it, this is the most unstable shoe I have ever worn. And it's not particularly close. Walking in it creates some drunken boxing vibes and I'm a bit worried about my ankles. But this is a running shoe, so let's run in it.

My easy pace ranges from 05:15 - 05:30 per km (08:27 - 08:46 per mile). Even at this warmup pace, the shoe instantly feels a lot more stable then when standing or walking around.

After the warmup, I did 15 and 12 minutes of threshold (slightly above 4mins/km or 06:25 per mile) with 4 minutes of jogging in between. Needless to say that this shoe really came alive when turning it up.

The ride is like nothing I have ever tried. It feels absolutely wild. The shoe wants to keep you on your midfoot and forefoot and in general moves you forward really well.

I did some strides and was pleasantly surprised how smooth the transitions were. I though that accelerating and slowing down would create some wobbling, but that was not the case.

Cornering is a problem. You have to slow way down to feel in control. If you plan to use it on a more difficult course, you might wanna think again. Also, anything other than a well-kept road (e.g. cobblestones) would be a no-no for this shoe.

Here's my biggest gripe: I didn't seem to run efficiently. I hit my paces easily, but my HR was quite high at the end of the second rep. I usually prefer a rolling type of shoe due to my mechanics. I feel like all the bounce creates some unnecessary movement. This is 100% a personal thing, but I am sure there are other runners who feel the same.

So all in all, it's a fast shoe, it's a unique shoe. I am just not sure, if it's the right shoe for my fall marathon. Of course, this was only the first run. I will test it some more in the future.",2025-04-03 06:17:27+00:00,188,57

1joyn7z,RunningShoeGeeks,Brooks Ghost 16 @ 225 Miles,"Heavy runner - (6'0"" - 225 pounds; mid/forefoot striker) The past year is the first time I have used running as my main form of fitness (3-5 Miles a week to 10+ miles a week). Prior to these shoes, I have primarily used Nike Pegasus. I usually stick in the 2-4 Mile range with my long runs going out to 10 (Pretty limited time so long runs aren't feasible regularly). Best efforts in these shoes:

* 1 Mile: 6:49
* 5K: 22:33
* 10k: 58:11
* 10 Mile: 1:40:16

One other shoe in my rotation but prefer the Ghost for the majority of runs: On Cloudmonster

I think I will go with the Hyperion Max 2 as my next shoe or something similar.

**Sizing:** TTS

**Upper:** Durable and breathable. No tears or wear spots. The white got discolored quickly but that would be expected running in the city.

**Laces:** Got gifted a pair of caterpy laces and tried them out. Liked them so much I ended up switching the laces on my cloudmonsters as well.

**Midsole:** Seemed very responsive coming from my Pegasus with \~300 miles. They did take some time to break in it seemed. I have noticed that at approximately 200 miles, the foam seemed to have lost some of its shock absorption.

I don't have much experience to draw from to really compare to other shoes.

**Outsole:** Super durable. Good grip on concrete and decent grip when wet. Some wear in the midfoot but seems to have plenty of miles left.",2025-04-01 15:37:59+00:00,74,25

1jnnxw4,RunningShoeGeeks,Puma Deviate Nitro Elite 3 after 30 miles,"**Total distance ran:**

30 miles (48 km)

**Type of runs:**

Progression run with strides (7:40's min/mile down to 6:30's min/mile), Paced a half marathon (7:20's min/mile) and finished out the morning with 7 miles at marathon effort (6:30's-6:50's min/mile). Ran on roads and a small amount of dirt trail.

**Weather ran in:**

Dry and rainy conditions

**My profile:**

Height: 6’0”

Weight: 160lbs

Weekly mileage: 70 miles (\~112km). 1:24 HM and 2:57 FM

Strike Type: Shufflle-y midfoot striker

**Positives:**

* Fits true to size
* Easy to get a secure lockdown
* Comfortable upper
* Responsive midsole
* Stable platform even when taking sharp turns
* Excellent wet weather grip

**Negatives:**

* Stained my socks purple 

**Overview:**

Currently training for Boston with a 3-shoe rotation: Superblast 1, Puma Deviate Nitro 2 and Alphafly 3. I plan to use the AF3 for the marathon, but they have 250 miles on them, so I needed a workout shoe for the remaining weeks leading up to race day.

The Puma Deviate Nitro Elite 3 had been on my radar for a few months, but I was waiting for a version in my size that didn't have the words ""Nitro"" blasted across the upper. And these purple ones fit the bill, as they reminded me of a pair of lilac Adios Pro 3's I took to over 400 miles. On my first run in the DNE3, the midsole's responsiveness was eerily similar to what I experienced in the AP3 -- though with a far more comfortable upper -- and cutting down to marathon pace felt effortless. 

My second run in them was a 20-mile day that included pacing a half marathon on a hilly course on a wet and very windy morning. Whether I was running through puddles, sandy bike path, muddy patches or taking sharp turns, I felt sure-footed throughout. On my cooldown, I picked up the pace and they were a delight at marathon effort. My only gripe so far is, when I took them off, they had stained my socks purple. 

**Worth buying?:**

Yes. Looking forward to putting more miles in these and using them for a marathon this summer.

1jnaz1t,RunningShoeGeeks,[UK] Sportsshoes.co.uk - Novablast 3 Platinum Women’s £79.99 - limited sizes,,2025-03-30 12:04:41+00:00,16,2
1jmt0sn,RunningShoeGeeks,Superblast 2 @365 Miles,"**Shoe Model & Size:** ASICS Superblast 2 in a size 10.5

For context I am a 6'0"" tall runner who weighs 155 pounds. I am a forefoot/midfoot striker who tends to supinate as you can tell from my wear pattern. I am currently averaging about 40MPW and my race times are:

* 5K: 18:55
* HM: 1:37
* Marathon: 3:28

I am a bit of a running shoe nerd who has also tried a lot of different shoes and am ramping up for race season 2025.

Before I get into the review, **here are other shoes I have tried**:

* Shoes I like: Triumph 21, Novablast 5, Evo SL, Endorphin Speed 4, Alphafly 3
* Shoes I'm meh (not my favorite but the note worst): Novablast 4, 1080v14, Nike Tempo, New Balance SC Elite v4
* Shoes I hate: On CloudMonster Hyper, Nike Invincible 3, Endorphin Speed 3, Endorphin Pro 4

**How I used these:** I did literally everything in this shoe except racing and track work. These have been a workhorse daily for me accumulating almost all of my mileage post NYC marathon and during my build back from some IT Band Injury. I did long runs (up to 15 miles), workouts, easy miles, and everyday runs in these.

These might be my favorite shoe of all time

**Sizing:** Go TTS, that's it, that's the headline

**Upper:** Super comfy woven upper, most of my work done in these was in winter and I found them breathable but also quite cozy. The inside of the upper is very well padded and it has a plush step-in feel that makes your foot feel locked down and secure

**Tongue and Laces:** The tongue is pretty thin and is one of the elements that pulls from race shoe heritage. It has a bit of cushion where you tie your laces which is great for alleviating pressure on the top of your ankle. The lacing system itself is simple, no nonsense, and I had no trouble getting a lockdown

**Midsole:** This is where the magic happens. The hefty slab of FF Turbo+ race foam makes for a fun ride. It feels great at easy paces but comes to life at marathon and half marathon paces. The second foam under the FF Turbo+ adds a lot of durability to the shoe. The foam feels very light and airy albeit firm. They definitely got softer over time but offered insane energy return for a non-plated shoe. I also felt like the amount of midsole in these did a great job of protecting the legs which is useful in higher mileage sections of your training block.

**Outsole:** Out of the NB4, NB5, and SB2, the Superblast 2 has the best outsole of any Asics shoe that I have tried so far. It is quite grippy and I never had issues with traction (even while running throughout a cold and icy Chicago winter). There is a good amount of wear on the lateral side as you can see in how smoothed out that is in the picture. This pretty common with my supination.

**Durability:** I think the durability and quality of this shoe supports the price point. While expensive for a non-plated shoe, I think its worth because of the amazing ride, versatility, and quality of materials. While I could take these to 400 miles, I am probably not going to as I can till the foam is starting to bottom out for me in the forefoot causing some ankle pain. I think a lot of runners could take them to 400-450 miles, I just wear out my shoes a lot quicker than others because I land pretty hard.

In terms of cosmetics, they look great aside from dirt on the upper. The foam has less creasing than I expected and the outsoles are good too except for the lateral edges I pointed out and some cracking in the foam.  
Also worth calling out that this is the only shoe I have bought two pairs of. I have a second pair on ice that I will busting out this Summer for my Chicago Marathon training block. Currently working through the EVO SLs, Novablast 5s, and using my Alphafly 3's for workouts.

Going to give these a 10/10. I hope ASICS doesn't change much in these. Might have to keep my eyes peeled for a 3rd pair just in case. Worth the hype - I'd recommend these to anyone.",2025-03-29 18:38:05+00:00,317,96

1jmqp2s,RunningShoeGeeks,Vaporfly 4,"Sizing: TTS

Long and short of this is: The Vaporfly is back for me. The VF3 lost a bit of the crazy speed and connectedness in exchange for more comfort. The 4 is back to being a lightning rod that you grab onto and enjoy the ride.

Starting with the upper, it is slightly more dialed in than the VF3, less baggy over the toes but still highly comfortable. The mesh is lightweight and breathes well, but does not feel brittle despite how light this shoe is. There is still the familiar heel cushion in the back of this shoe that I loved in the VF1-3.

The midsole and ride are where this gets exciting. I have not used the Adios Pro Evo 1, so this is by far the lightest super shoe I have ever felt. The weight is almost imperceptible on foot. Nike has also cut down the stack height from 40/32, to 35/29. So a 6mm drop instead of 8mm. People seemed alarmed when this news came out, but I would remind everyone that the original Vaporfly stack was 33/23. There is not a cushioning deficit here for almost any type of run. 

The updated plate/geometry in the 4 and incredible light weight means this thing flies. Absolutely ripped through the middle section of my 6 mile initial workout. I turned in some of the fastest mile intervals I’ve done in months in this shoe and it begged for more. Turnover is incredibly easy, accompanied by a strong pop from the foam and plate. Even my “cooldown” mile was far faster than my usual cooldown pace. I would easily use this up to a half marathon as I feel it is slightly more stable than the VF3 and cushioned enough. They have differentiated this successfully from the AF3 now as well.

Outsole has switched back to a similar layout from the VF1/2, but a bit grippier lugs in the front. No complaints here, it just works. Very very impressed so far and this will be my go to for some upcoming shorter races",2025-03-29 16:55:31+00:00,420,59

1jm3e4h,RunningShoeGeeks,Saucony Ride 17 400 Mile Review,"Since the Ride 18 is now available, this is for those trying to make a decision on whether it’s worth buying a discounted pair of 17s.

Male runner, 5’10”, 180 lbs, 20-25mpw, heel striker. I run for fun not performance so I don’t have identified 5k/10k/HM paces but I’m generally running 7-10 miles with a pace in the range of 7:30-8:20 min/mile. Haven’t pushed further on distance because I’m a middle aged guy trying to build back up slowly after injury, no doubt that these shoes will hold up well on longer distances. Rotate Ride 17 as road daily with ES2 for road tempo and Endorphin Edge for trail.

This shoe was my return to Saucony after a foray through On and Hoka. Left On for all the normal reasons, Hoka because I got tired of running on marshmallows. Shoes felt great from the beginning and improved with some break in. Firmer but not too firm. Adapts well to different paces from slow to moderate to low end tempo, though won’t push to the paces I can get with ES2. In the best way, it’s a shoe I don’t notice - though not the lightest it doesn’t feel heavy; neither slowing me down or speeding me up; I never finish a run with my feet hurting or my legs sore from the shoe.

Upper not the most breathable but also didn’t feel hot to me; then again my feet tend to not feel hot in shoes anyway for some reason. Great in cold weather; I can definitely feel the cold in my ES2s but not these.

I bought a half size too large which gave me some lockdown issues, which caused the rubbing you’ll see the top of the heel, especially on my left foot (half size shorter than right). Improved once I got a better lockdown. Outside of that, upper has always been comfortable, no hotspots or blisters or other issues.

Wet traction isn’t great - feels a tad slippy but has never caused an injury or fall. Moreso just feel the lack of traction and lose a few seconds off my pace.

Already have another pair ready to replace these (though in the right size), but may be a while. I’ve never had a shoe feel this awesome at 400 miles and expect another 100+ miles in them. Recommend as a great stable neutral daily trainer to affordably eat up miles in comfort. They may not pop like Novablasts (while the pop lasts) or fly like Evo SL (if you can handle the Evo SL’s instability), but are a great jack of all trades. Can’t match the combination or comfortable upper + TPU foam + durability at this price point.",2025-03-28 19:28:56+00:00,73,33

Comment with the shoes you'd like tested, and I'll prioritize the community request before other shoes.



Note, however, that it will take us a couple of months to be up and running as we're waiting for spare parts to follow the ASTM 1976 standard instead of the current SATRA TM142 (=current results, slightly different but highly correlated).

Shoes I own. Adios pro 3, Cielo x1, Novablast 5, puma magmax, HOKA Bondi 9 

Aware this shoe has been reviewed to death but thought would give my view on it for anyone considering it at the moment. 

How I have used it: original purchased for a road ultra marathon but quickly figured out it wasn’t for that (more on that later). Generally using for distances between 10 - 30km with paces ranging from 3:30 to 4:45 (km per min). So have used it as more a speed shoe or uptempo shoe. I did also do a 3:08 marathon in them as part of the testing for an ultra shoe so have put some decent miles into them. 

Fit: very comfortable upper and fits me tts. Maybe slightly long but would go tts. There is a bit of an aggressive “taper” (if that the right word) at the front of your shoe by your small toes so had a little bit of rubbing there but wasn’t an issue after the first run or two. For reference though I have a pretty narrow foot so could see that being a potential issue for wider foot individuals. 

Ride: if I had to sum it up it in a sentence it would be “mid amount of cushion, but a firmer shoe that prefers quicker speeds”. I saw some reviews talking about how it is nice and cushioned while having a good bounce, but this wasn’t my experience in them. To me it gave you quite a planted feeling to the ground, while being fairly firm and stiff. When you cruising at around 5 pace and under its work well but found anything around 5:30-6 (km pace) just a little flat and uncomfortable. 
I also see it be suggested quite often as an affordable (not really) marathon race option. But for the previously mentioned race I ran I have never gotten to the end of a race with my legs feeling so beat up, by the end felt I was almost running barefoot and was getting nothing out of the shoes. So would rather get a discounted pair of carbon race shoes which will probably be cheaper anyway.

Aware it all sounds negative but they certainly work at certain areas. Speed or harder efforts up to 20/25km I think they do well especially when you pushing closer to that 4-4:30 pace. Also a bit more specific to me but have enjoyed them for my track workout as always feel a little unstable in my race shoes going around those bends so me it has worked great on a track cause of how planted I feel in them.
But if you wanting a great long run/marathon shoe I would look at something else. 

Durability: been decent. Starting to see some scuff marks on the non protected areas of the soles which doesn’t really happen this soon for me but otherwise been fine. 
To the durability the sole is fine but find it very slippery in the wet so would be careful using it in wet conditions. 

Summary: for the price you pay for these I would give it a miss. They decent shoes but not £175 shoes. Especially when you starting to see some super shoes close to that. 
But if you wanting a tempo or speed shoe in your rotation and prefer the firmer/closer to the ground feeling then think these are a good option to consider. 
But if you wanting a do it all shoe I would probably suggest something else. 

Happy to answer any questions.

1jkif6m,RunningShoeGeeks,Atreyu Daily Trainer 2 - Worth it? - Initial Review,"Atreyu has stepped up the their price point on this one which has gotten some mixed feedback. I for one have zero regret giving them more than I'm used to for these, and I hope people don't sleep on them.

After a few runs at a range of paces (5:30/mi strides to 11/mi recovery run, low to high zone 2 and hour tempo run), and a good bit of experience with most of Atreyu's current lineup of shoes, I can pretty confidently say that this is not only the best, most versatile and best looking shoe Atreyu has released, they've also achieved what the prior versions of the Daily Trainer did not. Namely, they've grabbed the best features of their (truly beloved to many) Base model and (major value buy for a carbon plated supertrainer->race shoe) Race model, for a shoe you can use most days (maybe even truly daily for a lot of folks).

You get almost, but not quite as much lightness and ground feel responsiveness as the Base… but you make up for it clearly in durability and a fun bouncier ride with a lot more energy return. And you don’t get quite as much pick up and top speed efficiency as the Race… but you make up for it in a more stable shoe at a wider range of speeds, and a peppy feel in the outsole that is still close to a plated shoe (probably due to the lower stack and superfoam combo) so you can still turn it up in when you want to. It's not 100% Pebax, but if you haven't tried Atreyu's supercritical EVA (which Pebax is mixed with in the DT 2), it's really quite nice even on its own.

Aesthetically, it’s definitely the sharpest looking shoe Atreyu has made, and it is clearly built to last. Only gripe is the shoelaces (seem to be same as the Race model for those that have them). I can't seem to get a good tie with them where I want it and they are hard to double knot. Was hoping for something a little more premium there, but you can't have it all. Like the Base, the upper fits me perfectly with zero heel slippage, so even without getting a secure tie exactly where I want it to be, I’m not in a rush to change them, but I still probably will. Not sure if I’ll go with lock laces (may because I’d like to take them on some longer runs where I sometimes need to loosen on the fly) or just plain white cotton laces like the Base model comes with so I can also wear them casually. Super comfortable walking shoe as well.

I set them immediately to my default road shoe on Strava (lately I've been bouncing between the Topo Specter 2 and Cyclone 2 fairly evenly). I'll still use the Cyclone from time to time, but I don't think I'll use the Specter 2 as much now that I have these. Size-wise - I went with a 10 which is a half size up from TTS for me and same as all Atreyus. In the future, I'll probably go up a full size for the Race and Base Trail models, but these fit me just like the Base model, perfect a half size up.",2025-03-26 18:09:46+00:00,59,48

1jkc7hb,RunningShoeGeeks,Olympikus - Corre Max (Brazilian brand) thoughts,"About me: 1.75m, 72kg. 5km in 35min, 10km in 55min. I started running in June 2023.

Recently, I bought a pair of Olympikus Corre Max (size 40 BR) for R$499.00 ($87.00 USD). I've only done one 5k run with them so far.

The Positives

✅ Comfort – The Olympikus Corre Max is the softest shoe I've ever had, it feels like putting my foot into a very soft cushion. Everything is well-padded, and my feet feel great after a walk, and I had no pain at all. The fit is true to size, with plenty of space in the forefoot, especially in the toe box. It’s also wide on the sides, like most Olympikus models.

✅ Cushioning and running experience – The Olympikus Corre Max is extremely soft, possibly the softest shoe I've ever tried (compared to my Asics Gel Nimbus 26 and Mizuno Victory). However, it’s not too soft to the point of feeling unstable because it still maintains a good energy return. Running in them feels smooth and effortless. It's probably not the best option for speed or tempo training, as its weight and lack of energy return work against it (the outsole is firm, but the EVA-based midsole slightly counteracts that). But for easy runs, it's perfect. The Mizuno Victory is much firmer and offers better energy return due to its seemingly harder outsole, but I still prefer the Olympikus Corre Max.

✅ Ventilation – Despite the plush cushioning, the shoe remains breathable, which should be great for spring/summer. Even in higher temperatures, I believe it will stay cool and comfortable on my feet.

The Negative

❌ Energy Return – As mentioned before, I think the shoe could benefit from a slightly firmer outsole to make it more responsive, cause it lacks a bit of ""explosion"" I imagine that its more premium version, with a graphene sole (Corre 3 Grafeno), might be able to fix this.

Conclusion

So far, I've really enjoyed the Olympikus Corre Max. The comfort and softness are its biggest highlights, better than any other shoe I've tried. It's an excellent shoe for easy and long runs. I have a feeling that its premium versions could be even better.",2025-03-26 13:49:14+00:00,63,16

1jiu9al,RunningShoeGeeks,Mizuno Wave Rebellion Pro 2 aka the Mizuno RebellionFly -Next%. Bonus comparison to Adidas Prime X Strung.,"I know this is a review of some old has been shoes, but maybe someone will find it interesting, given the Wave Rebellion Pro 2's are now on some pretty big clearance sales.

Background:

51M, 5'9"", 174 lbs.  Run about 35 to 55 mpw, depending on season.  Daily running pace is \~ 9 min / miles @ \~ 135 bpm.  Size 10.5 ft width D.  I usually size up to 11 in shoes.

Gear:

I run with a Garmin 645M, Stryd (half the time), Polar chest strap HRM (most of the time).

Current Rotating shoes:

Asics Novablast 3, Superblast 1, Mizuno Wave Sky 7, Nike Vaporfly Next%, Nike AF1, Adidas Prime X Strung.  Most of these shoes are either EOL, or halfway there.  PXS is toast at 800 miles now, but I just swapped in my last brand new pair.

So, now that I'm on the last pair of my favorite shoe of all time (Prime X Strung), I figured I should start looking at other super trainer type shoes.  Some shoes that were up for consideration: Hoka Cielo X1, and the Wave Rebellion Pro 2.  I already tried the Prime X Strung 2 a year ago, and I had to send them back.  They were absolutely horrible.  The Wave Rebellion Pro 2 looked intriguing, and they were on a big sale.  I got them for $134 before tax.  I'm not a big fan of Mizuno, and have another pair of their dailies that I loathe.  Prior to that, the last Mizuno I ran in was over 20 years ago.  But, I was willing to give Mizuno another chance.  I've ran in them these past three days, and put 15 miles on them.  I did back to back testing with these shoes and my last brand new pair of PXS.  Here are some initial thoughts:

1. Fit: I got these in a size 11, and damn, they fit SMALL.  The toe box is really narrow and cramped.  I would return these just because of the size.  Size 11 in the Adidas Prime X Strung is awesome.  I have so much room in the toe box, that my feet swim in it.  If you size up by half for your running shoes, you might want to size up a full size for these.  Especially with the weird geometry of the midsole, my feet keeps sliding into the toe box area more, and my toes feel like they're getting jammed the hell up.
2. Weight: These are some fairly light shoes.  I weighed them at 8.6 oz's.  Surprisingly, there is a pretty big difference in weight between both sides of about 0.25 oz's.  My Adidas PXS weighs a full oz+ more at 9.8 oz.  Also surprising that the PXS also has a difference in weight between both sides of about 0.2 oz's.
3. Midsole: The midsole is honestly magical.  I have the Mizuno Wave Sky 7 that has a big stack height of 41 mm and their new Enerzy midsole.  I absolutely hated that shoe.  I got it because I'm on Amazon Vine, and it was offered to me for free.  I haven't ran in a Mizuno since over 20 years ago, but the new midsole and hype got me excited to run in a Mizuno again.  But, that hype was quickly popped after I ran in the shoe.  The midsole was hard and FIRM, and it was just a heavy, clunky shoe.  Just despise it and can't wait to hit 400 miles so I can toss the shoes. With the Wave Rebellion Pro 2, the midsole feels super bouncy and energetic.  I hate using the term responsive, because to me, that just means FIRM and HARD as hell.  I like midsoles that are BOUNCY (think Nike Invincible Run midsole).  And, the Wave Rebellion Pro 2 BOUNCES like trampolines.  I actually think it's bouncier than the Alphafly and even the Prime X Strung, especially with that weird geometry.
4. Outsole: It's fine, not much else to say about it.
5. Upper: Very thin, breathable, and light.  I love the upper.  It's a synthetic engineered structured fabric that is different than anything else in my rotating shoes.
6. Geometry: Very odd.  The drop isn't the issue, but that significant rocker just makes this shoe really difficult for me to run in.  As a mid foot striker, I end up landing right on the rocker like it's a fulcrum, which makes the trampoline effect more pronounced.  It really feels like you're landing on the tip of a soft triangle.  The triangle compresses and pops you right back up.  This sounds great in theory, but for me, it starts to fatigue my foot arch quickly.  I start to run in a way that actively avoids this, and try to land more on the forefoot.  But, because the geometry of the shoe is so weird in the forefoot (not a lot of drop), the shoe teeters back on that triangle part of the shoe to the heel.  This really fatigues my quads.

First run was a SLOW 5 miler with my wife.  We jogged 10:30 min / miles, and that whole time, I was thinking, ""Damn, these are a slog to run in.""  My legs, calves and quads, felt pretty beat from that jog.  I wasn't sure why.  But, I figured on Sat. I would do a back to back 5 miler with this shoe against my newly opened Prime X Strung.

Second run was this past Sat.  I did the first 5 miles in the Mizunos.  I warmed up one mile, and then ran 2 miles out and 2 miles back.  Timed the distance and checked the average HR.  I did the same run in the Adidas after resting, hydrating, and eating some dry cereal.  Started the 2 miles out and back at the around the same HR as the Mizunos.  The Mizunos felt like a chore to run.  It was fatiguing my legs a bit.  The Adidas were great in comparison.  Legs felt much better, but I think they were fatigued from the Mizunos, so it wasn't the best run.  I ran the distance around the same time, and checked my average HR.  Surprisingly, it was around the same.  So, I figured I would give it another go today and start with the Adidas first.

Yesterday, did the same run.  Warmed up a mile, then ran 2 mile out and back.  Damn, the Adidas felt awesome.  I just started picking up the pace and was down to 7:30 min / miles.  On the way back, I was around 7 to 7:30 min miles as the slight head wind turned to a tail wind.  Legs felt awesome.  Then I hydrated, rested, cooled off (warm day in the upper 70's), and had some dry cereal.  Went back in the Mizunos, and even the 1 mile warm up was a slog.  Doing the next 4 and it was HARD to hit the same time as the Adidas.  My legs felt SO fatigued, I almost wanted to stop and walk for a bit, but I soldered on and finished a bit over the time of the Adidas.  I checked my average HR and it was 157 bpm vs 150 bpm for the Adidas.  It sure felt like it.  I have now christened this shoe as the new NEGATIVE Next%, because it feels like it's sapping energy instead of giving it back.

Conclusion:

These shoes are going back.  I'm returning them, like I did the Adidas Prime X Strung 2's.  It would have been a great shoe, I think, if it wasn't for the weird geometry of the mid sole.  I love the midsole material, and the upper and how light the shoe is, but they need to get rid of that aggressive rocker.  I think the new Wave Rebellion Pro 3 has much better geometry, and I wouldn't mind checking out that shoe sometime.  But, right now, I think I just have to hope that the Prime X Strung 3 re-captures the magic of the OG shoe.

1jir34v,RunningShoeGeeks,Endorphin Elite 2,"Sizing: TTS, a touch snug around the toes, some may want to go a half size up.

Took these out for a first 8 mile spin yesterday, I was a bit dubious given how soft they felt but read that the energy return is top notch and decided to trust in that assessment. 

First off, the upper is amazing in these. Probably the most comfortable upper of any super shoe. The heel collar is especially plush and it is easy to achieve a very controlled lockdown, which for a shoe this soft is very important. I did notice the toebox tapering in a bit near the pinky toe, it wasn’t an issue on the run but some may want to size up slightly to avoid any possible issue there.

Now onto the midsole and ride. The Elite 1’s midsole is one of my favorite ever for how stable it is and how much pop it has. Reading about the 2 and how squishy it was, gave me some apprehension. After getting on well enough with the Adios Pro 4, another squishy midsole, I decided to take the plunge here. All I can say is this is the most absurdly soft material I have ever felt. When walking, you can feel the shoe deform as it squishes almost to the pavement with each step. Once I started running though, the squish was accompanied by a rebound I have never felt, this is the bounciest midsole I have ever tried. 

At half marathon and 10k pace the midsole firmed up slightly and delivered amazing return. It felt pretty much on par with the return in the Elite 1, but obviously differs drastically in how it delivers that bounce. The 1 has a snappy poppy responsive feeling when paired with an aggressive rocker that keeps you turning over. The 2 has a booming bounce and a similar rolling sensation up front. Amazingly, for how soft the midsole is, I don’t have any soreness around my ankles today, suggesting it has decent stability on the run despite being so soft. I would still not recommend this for anyone with stability issues as such a soft foam creates challenges in that department. Is it better than Elite 1? Tough to say…it is very different and may work better for some.

The outsole is much much grippier than version 1 and feels confidence inspiring. The only downside is I am seeing a bit of wear on the exposed foam just because the shape of the midsole deforms so much when striking the ground. Durability is not likely to be great here. 

Bottom line, this is a very fun ride, and it legitimately feels different than anything I’ve ever run in before. Even if it does not work for everyone, Saucony deserves kudos for trying something new. A lot of super shoes feel similar nowadays and this is a completely different experience that I’d recommend people consider if it fits their needs",2025-03-24 13:48:52+00:00,273,72

1jii7do,RunningShoeGeeks,Adidas Adizero Adios Pro 4 First Run - are they worth $100 more than the EVO SL?,"58 year-old mid/forefoot striker at 5’8”, 150 lbs.  After many years of wearing size 9’s, I now go a half size up to 9 1/2 in Adidas and Asics to have more room in the toe box and avoid losing toenails.  Easy 9-10/mi, 7-7:15 5K, 7:30 10K, 8:15-8:30 half, 10 marathons ranging from a 3:27:16 BQ to over 4:30.

I took the Pro 4’s out for a 9 miler today with 3 miles easy, 3 at HM pace, and back down to 3 easy.  Seeing as this shoe is the upgrade to the EVO SL, this could almost be considered a copycat to my review of that shoe with a few tweaks. 

Positives for the Pro 4:

- Lightstrike Pro foam is so good.  The cushioning is soft yet firm. Just feels great right out of the box and should get better with more mileage.

- Energy Rods 2.0 gave the shoe quite a bit more spring than the EVO SL’s.

- Upper has a better feel to it than the EVO’s.  The Lightlock lacking system kept the laces in place and, well, locked in.

- The grip on the Pro 4 is far superior for sure due to the LIGHTTRAXION compound.  It’s almost as if the shoe was grabbing the asphalt and throwing me forward.

- So lightweight. According to the Adidas website, they come in at 7.05 ounces in a size 9.

- The rocker position comes up quick and the transition/toe off is excellent.

- Roomy toe box, both in width and height. I did not experience any rubbing at all.

- More stable than the EVO’s.  I really don’t know how this is as the heel is narrower, but that’s the way they feel to me.  Maybe the slight increase in the forefoot width.

- The white/black/red colorway is so classic.  Love it!

Negatives:

- My legs were a little fatigued after the run.  Could be due to a lot of factors from today, including the 80 degree heat that I am not quite accustomed to yet, but usually a 9 miler won’t have that effect on me.

- Not recommended for heel strikers due to the narrow heel.

I never in a million years would have thought I would ever had bought a pair of the Pro 4’s as I despised the 3’s due to the clunky ride that made them feel heavier than they were.  However, due to how much I love the EVO SL’s, I took a chance and really, really like this shoe.  It’s definitely an upgrade, but is it worth an extra $100?  Even thought the Pro 4 will be my half marathon and above shoe going forward, my initial thought after the first run is if I had to choose that I would go with the EVO SL as it is more versatile and I just don’t think the advantages are worth the extra cost for the everyman/woman runner.  I may change my mind after the second or third run, but for now I would only go with the Pro 4 as a dedicated race shoe.  If you are looking to shave an extra minute or two off for a BQ, NYCQ, Berlin Q or PR, then for sure the Pro 4 is worth the extra money…..but that’s the whole point of the shoe!

1jibvlr,RunningShoeGeeks,HOKA Cielo X1 2.0,"

This is my experience with the Cielo X1 2.0.  

Additionally I have the X1 and absolutely love them.    I primarily use them as a long run shoe.    

Rocket X2 has been my race shoe for the last 2 years.   May be my all time favorite racer.   Just got the Cielo 2.0 so it’s possible to move to #1 for me. 

55 yr old.  5’10” 175 lbs.  Midfoot striker. 
Avg 5k =19:15
10k =39-40 min
13.1 = 1:30 
Not a marathoner so this information may not apply if you are.   
Avg 30 miles per week
20+ races per year. 

Used the 2.0 for several threshold runs.   Mile repeats at 6:10 mile.  Have an upcoming 5 miler I will race in them.   

MIDSOLE:
Amazing bounce and energetic ride.   Smooth ride that gets even smoother the faster you go.   It is truly a slimmed down X1 however it feels slightly more energetic and nimble.   Extremely fun and effective.  
Rocker is aggressive.   When you hit your paces the shoe is so smooth.  

FIT:  
Fit is TTS for me compared to my  X1 and Rocket X2.    
No gaps or puckering in fabric. Ample toe room and width.   Foot is secure however no hot spots.  
I like the solid heel counter.   Foot is held in place and I don’t even notice the heel.  
The laces are not saw tooth however I’m pleased with them.  No slippage at all.  
Tongue stays in place and is a good length.   It is not gusseted however it does a great job of staying in place.  

STABILITY:   
The heel is very soft so just walking or standing feels like a negative drop sometimes.  
I think that is also due to the cutout in the heel to eliminate weight.  
I have zero stability issues during the run.   I am a midfoot striker and this shoe is stable as long as you do not heel strike.   I’ve had some turns and direction changes during my threshold runs and I was not concerned about stability.  

A lot of influencer comments about lack of stability however you should try it for yourself and make your own decision.   

I don’t have any concerns or issues with this shoe.  

Overall I’m very pleased with the x2.0 and like it better than expected.   I have experience with Alphafly 1, Vaporfly 2 & 3, ASICS Sky and Endorphin Pro 3.  

Everyone is different and respond differently to shoes.   I hope my experience helps someone if they are interested in the X 2.0.   Lots of great choices available and an amazing time to be a runner.  ",2025-03-23 22:39:31+00:00,205,36
1jibmqx,RunningShoeGeeks,Asics Novablast 5 after 500km (310~miles),"Hello guys, I figured that novablast 5 is a very popular shoe and at the same time I haven't seen a review after a higher mileage yet so I decided I will provide one.

Info about me: I am an average runner running for two and a half years and got into running from cycling. My height is 180cm (6 feet) and weight about 85-86kg (186lbs) so I am slightly heavier runner. Midfoot striker.

Times: 5k 20:48, 10k 43:40, HM 1:38:33, M 3:57:15

Before NB5 I had used On Cloudeclipse for my first marathon training and did every session and the marathon itselft in them with total mileage of 620miles and Asics gel cumulus 24 before that for casual running and first halfmarathon as I got into running with total mileage of 650miles. Since then I bought edge paris for my races ( I have run 3 10km races in them so far and are awesome)

I have got this shoe for Christmas so I have ran 500km in them in 3 months time. As money is kinda tight right now, this is my only shoe in my shoe rotation beside my racing shoe. I have a halfmarathon on 6th of April which is my A class race for this year beside marathon in the fall season. I am following one of the coros training plans and I am running 6x a week.

As i said, this my only training shoe so I have run everything in them - easy, z2, tempo, HM intervals, longer runs with HM pace, strides - everything with longest runs being up to 18km. This adds up to 50 - 70km weekly depending on the week.

My thoughts after 500kms:

As you can see, the wear is kinda high and visible with the upper torn in multiple places. I can only compare with the cloudeclipse and gel cumulus 24, but this kind of wear on cloudeclipse was after approximately 700km and the gel cumulus 24 with 1100km still look better today than the NB5 after 500km. On the other hand, the upper is very breathable and thin compare to the upper of gel cumulus and the cloudeclipse got even worse damage but after more kms. I don't think I got damage on them after 500kms. The tongue and the laces I had no problem with.

The outsole looks almost like new with slight wear on the outer parts which i land on. However compared to the cloudeclipse it is great and it looks similar to the outsole of gel cumulus which also has great outsole in my opinion. However, i find the NB5 outsole less grippy mainly on wet tarmac and when I picked up the speed during strides (3:20min/km) or some faster intervals (~ 4min/km).

Now the midsole. At first, great. Yes, it is very springy, yes it is fun to run in. The shoe is light, it bounces perfectly under you and it kinda makes you do a higher and longer strides thanks to the bounce. I actually used to run more cadence style but running in NB5 my cadence got lower a bit and my strides got longer. Very easy steps. The shoe felt the best mainly around steady Z2 and tempo paces (around 5:00 to 4:30min/km for me). In very easy runs, it did not feel somehow special and for more harder workouts and strides I sometimes lacked the grip as i said. I would say I enjoyed the shoe for maybe 300km maybe even less before the attributes of the shoe just vanished and after 400km they got worse from run to run. After 500km the midsole is completely dead and it feels like I am running on rubber pucks. There is no response all together. No bounce. Nothing. Yes, the foam is still there but that is it. Nothing to it anymore. I dont think the other shoes I had are this dead after more than 1000kms in them. I have actually gone for a run in my old cumulus 24 and they feel better after 1100kms and they are more firm new from the box. The last few runs until I was convinced to order new cumulus 27 were very unfun and hard to run.

Other issue for me was stability. My right foot is over pronating a bit but I have never had any issues/injury/pain other than worn out shoes to the inside. You can see from the picture from the back that the right shoe is slightly tilted inward to the left from my overpronating. The heel on NB5 is very stacked and it did not help as I was using it everyday and it got uncomfortable for my ankle in the last few tens of miles ran in the shoes. However, as i said, I had no issues prior even in cloudeclipse which are also high stacked and had used them a lot. Stability has also convinced me to go for the cumulus again next as the stack is lower.

Overal, I understand that I am a heavier runner and that using the same shoe 6x a week is not helping, however, this shoe is promoted as do it all and with its price around 150€/$ I would say it is supposed to be a workhorse shoe for daily kms/miles and with my prior experiences with daily runs/longer runs shoes lasting up to 800kms and more I am kinda disappointed that the novablast5 are dead after maybe 200 miles as I was overusing them and did not feel any benefits for the last 100miles for sure.",2025-03-23 22:28:15+00:00,280,106

1jhooo6,RunningShoeGeeks,Topo Magnifly 300-400 mile review,"So a little backstory. I came off of Hoka Cliftons. Hoka has served me well, meaning I was getting a lot less knee and hip pains but my toe pain just kept getting worse and worse. It was getting to the point to where I had thought about going to the doctor. I have ran 2 marathons in Hoka shoes, but I was thinking I needed something different. I have known for a while that I have high arches and wide feet for a while now, and Hoka just doesnt offer a lot of toe space to accomodate my feet. After some review, I decided to try a shoe with a wide toe box. I also wanted to try a zero drop shoe, because going from a 12mm drop to a 5mm drop made my knee and hip pains go away almost completely. This limited my options to Topo or Altra.

Reviewing Topo vs Altra shoes at the store revealed to me a few things. Altra is the better known brand and has the most reviews. Topo is kind of the lesser known little brother. Although Topo doesn't have as many reviews, it was pretty obvious to me that they made their shoes out of better quality material. Altra seemed to make their shoes out of plastic. They felt almost polyester like. My feet were sliding in them when I had them fully laced up. I determined this might be a problem on long runs as it may produce blisters.

Topo on the other hand seemed to make their shoes out of a felt or maybe cotton. They 'gripped' on to my feet a little better and felt like they weren't as cheaply made like you would imagine a plastic shoe. Topo in general fit my wide feet and high arches like a glove. It 'gripped' on to my heels, supported my arches, and allowed plenty of wiggle room for my toes. This made my decision to go to Topo. I decided to go with the magnify for the zero-drop option although the phantoms with their 4mm drop seemed to be more cushioned. This would be one of my only complaints as time went on.

My first few runs I had some knee discomfort and some Achilles discomfort. Although I contribute that to adaptation to a zero drop shoe. As the weeks passed on, that pain soon went away. My toe pain also got much much better as well with the roomy toe box these shoes provide. For reference, I have been using these as my only running shoe and putting in 30-40 mile weeks.

I have been wearing them not only on my runs but also at work. They are holding up alright. The tread is starting to wear down though, but to be expected with the miles I put on them.

My complaints with this shoe is that I wish I had gotten a size slightly larger or possibly in wide. Although my toe pain is better, I still could use a little more room on the edges of the shoe. Topo seems to size their shoes smaller than what's advertised. My other complaint is that there is not enough cushion. It is marketed as a 'medium' cushioned shoe but imo it could easily pass as a 'low' cushioned shoe. My feet hurt on long runs, something I hadn't seen with wearing my Hokas.

Overall, I would give this shoe a 9/10 score. It is a good quality shoe but fits smaller than advertised and is a little less cushioned than advertised. My next shoe is definitely going to be with Topo, and I'm eyeing the Phantoms. I'm not completely sold on zero drop and those Phantoms do seem to have better cushioning.",2025-03-23 02:00:30+00:00,43,7

1jgn1r1,RunningShoeGeeks,Saucony Endorphin Trainer,"I'd been waiting for the Endorphin Trainer since I heard about it as I really enjoyed the Kinvara Pro and this is basically version 2 of the Pro. When the negative reviews started hitting I had some second thoughts... until I won a free set of Sauconys at a 5k and decided to give them a shot. I'm glad I did! The Trainers improve what I liked about the Kinvara Pro, fix the things I didn't, and only take a small step back in one area.

A little about me for context: Male, 170#, 3:11 marathon, heel striker. I've but a little more than twenty miles on the Trainers so far.

The ride is similar to the Pros, but a little bouncier with the new foam. It seems to really work well if you heel strike as there's more incredirun (what a lame name) foam at the forefoot than at the heel. This adds a rolling sensation as the foam compresses which compliments the plate and rocker. When I tried landing mid- or fore-foot the shoe wasn't nearly as pleasant. Because these are relatively heavy for trainers, they don't shine at really fast work, but excel at holding a slow to moderate pace. That rolling sensation I mentioned earlier feels phenomenal when you lock in to about thirty seconds to a minute slower than marathon pace and cruise. The Kinvara Pros devoured easy miles and I expect these to do the same.

The biggest improvement is the upper -- the Kinvara Pro was a little warm for my taste and the Trainers have much better ventilation. I didn't have an issue with the Kinvara's lack of rubber on the outsole (I got roughly 400 miles out of a pair), but the added rubber on the Trainers should make them more durable.

The only real complaint I have is these are noisy. They have a pronounced ""clomp"" that can be a little distracting if I don't have headphones going.",2025-03-21 17:55:53+00:00,197,28

1jgl9z9,RunningShoeGeeks,Puma Deviate Nitro after 1050km (652 miles),"**Total distance ran:**  
652 miles (1050 km)

**Type of runs:**  
Easy Run, Long Run, Interval Work. 5k-30k

**Weather ran in:**  
Dry and wet conditions

**My profile:**  
Height: 6’1  
Weight: 165  
Range of average pace with this shoe: 8:00  
Strike Type: Midfoot  
Average runs a week: 50km

**Positives:**

	•	Comfortable for both speed work and long runs 

	•	Excellent versatility across different distances and paces

	•	True to size with secure midfoot, a glove like fit for me

	•	Soft, breathable upper with responsive Nitro foam cushioning

	•	Durable compared to other shoes I ran in (Saucony Endorphin Speed 3, Adidas Takumi Sen 8, Puma Velocity Nitro 2 )

	•	Perfect for days when workout type wasn’t predetermined

**Negatives:**

	•	The tongue is quite short and thin; it can be an issue if you do a runner knot 

	•	Not ideal for colder weather as the upper is super breathable

**Overview:**  
The Puma Deviate Nitro was my first pair of running shoes, purchased in March last year when I began my running journey. Sized at EU 45/US 11.5, these shoes fit true to size with a secure midfoot and comfortable toe box. The Nitro foam remained lively and responsive for the first 700km, then softened slightly but continued to provide comfort.

Durability has been impressive compared to other models I’ve tried - the Adidas Takumi Sen 8 upper failed after just 70km, Saucony Endorphin Speed 3 at 300km, and Puma Velocity Nitro 2 at 400km. Despite the upper failing at the right big toe around 700km due to my specific gait (keeping my big toe up while running), these shoes have outlasted my expectations.

Even after trying premium models like the Alphafly 2 and Vaporfly 2, I keep returning to the Deviate Nitro for its superior comfort and versatility. Initially planning to retire them at 1000km, I’ve now extended their life goal to 1500-1600km (1000 miles) as they continue performing well.

Has anyone here used the original Puma Deviate Nitro and upgraded to the Deviate Nitro 2 or Deviate Nitro 3? I’m looking for feedback on how the newer models compare as I’m searching for another workhorse shoe.

**Worth buying?**

1jgce3t,RunningShoeGeeks,Mizuno Neo Vista - 600Km/370mile review,"Hello,

Review for Mizuno Neo Vista after 600kms (604km when photos were taken)

**TLDR:** Fun bouncy shoes for shorter (less than 15k) faster paced runs on road surfaces.

https://preview.redd.it/ptau3v6cb0qe1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb11a24f76887dcdf6f007f899a3edbefe99182c

**Info on me:** 51 years old, 5'10"" 155lb, midfoot strike (maybe! see review and photos), 45-65mpw, average easy pace 8:00 min/mi. Size purchased is US10.5

I purchased these in 2024 when they were released in Australia. I did not use them a lot or regularly during 2024 as I have quite a number of shoes in the rotation, however for the past couple months they have been my daily shoe.

I've used these for moderate/hard pace 5-10k (I set my 10k pb in these) and slow long runs of 20k+. I don't recall going beyond 25k with these (reasons below).

**Outsole:** I started noticing wear at about the 400-450km mark. The wear pattern on these is really different to every other shoe I have worn/worn out. My usual wear pattern will start towards the heel/midfoot on the lateral/outer edge and then run across on a diagonal line towards the toe on the medial/inner side. I've got 22 'retired' shoes in strava and i can't think of any without this same wear pattern. The vista seem to have worn on the medial side only and start way at the heel, have a section of little wear and then a lot at the forefoot. It certainly doesn't feel like i'm heel striking when wearing these but evidence states otherwise. They're also a bit noisy when running uphill. They sound somewhat like horse shoes clip clopping. I expect this is due to the big cutout. The photo below shoes the areas of the outsole with noticeable wear.

https://preview.redd.it/vydcpcydb0qe1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bdf6c5ce3513c9df696a2120522786a87d3df084

On road / pavement surfaces the outside provides good grip. On any loose/compact gravel they're not good at all. I tend to feel my feet slipping every time I land and I am constantly thinking about it when i use these on anything other than a road surface.

This next photo is of the heel section looking towards the forefoot.

https://preview.redd.it/91t2wuyeb0qe1.jpg?width=764&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=36f60c225cfd1071a1ce2ef0fead0718ceab4ba9

**Midsole**: These were my first 'bouncy' shoes. Going from wearing mizuno wave rider (from v15 to 27) and other brands, when i tried these on i was shocked. I really didn't know that shoes could feel like this. They do feel strange when standing around or walking. I think this is due to the shape of the rocker which cuts away a bit at the heel (though nowhere near as much as the rebellion). When running I find they have a sweet spot for me at the 4:00 - 4:30 per km pace. Faster than this and there's better shoes (metaspeed edge paris). Once you're over the 5min pace they're kinda just bouncy and not really giving you any benefit. Again i think there's better shoes for paces at 5 and slower (asics glideride max). After 600kms they're still quite bouncy though i've not tried new ones on to compare. My only grievence with the midsole is running uphills. They feel too soft and I tend to land in the wrong place on the shoes particularly on steeper hills to get the benefit of the rocker.

**Upper:** I said to someone a while ago that i'd be happy if mizuno took the upper from saucony endorphin speed3 and placed it on the midsole of the neo vista. The upper is a stretchy / booty material which can be a little hard to get on. Once on I do not really need to tighten the laces at all. To me, the upper is the biggest issue particularly on long runs. Long runs when it is warm are especially bad. I can happily wear these for 1.5 hours but after that i start to notice my toes getting sore. If i run longer than 2 hours then I've usually got a couple toes which are red/bruised toenails etc. This is why i've not run beyond 25kms in these.

I have also noticed lately a slight heel lift/rubbing on my right foot as if the shoe is too large/long. I don't know if this has always been there or perhaps the upper has stretched a bit. It's not evident on my left and i've not changed socks etc. If you can get along with the upper and have maybe a slightly narrow foot, then they'd be great.

Also, the laces are comically long. See photo. They also come undone a bit so i find a double knot is worth doing (maybe that's why they're so long?)

https://preview.redd.it/xb52k6agb0qe1.jpg?width=2201&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=81ffb24c20bc81348d9cbe66e45b649708802a9b

**Tempo and distances:** I usually potter about at 4:30-5:00 with some intervals in the high 3's/low 4's if the plan calls for it. These are marketed as 'super trainers' so i assume that means not quite race day shoes but everyday faster than your brooks ghost / asic glideride type trainers. I think these fit that category well as they do work better in the speedier paces (speedy for me).

**Last thoughts:** Would I buy them again? No - I think the endorphin speed range is a better all rounder and also cheaper in Australia. I've been a wearer of mizuno since the wave rider 15. I've owned most wave rider models up to 27 along with wave catalyst, wave neo etc. I don't know if its me/my running or Mizuno but I've somewhat moved away from the brand in the last year in favor of asics and saucony. I have zero issues with the longevity of the mizuno shoes i've owned. I've never had holes in the uppers etc. The only reason I've retired mizuno is the midsole has started to feel wooden or the outsole has worn away to basically nothing. I expect i'll retire these in another \~150kms and like my other mizuno's the uppers will still be in very good condition as they are now.

1jftb7q,RunningShoeGeeks,Adizero Evo SL 125 mile Review,"Info on me: 5'9"" 150lb, midfoot strike, 45mpw, HM: 1:43:22, average easy pace 9:00 min/mi

Use Case: I've used this shoes exclusively for everyday miles and easy runs.

Upper: The mesh and foam around the upper has been very comfortable. The reinforced eyelets have made it so there hasn't been any lace bit which is a nice improvement over older adizero shoes. The tongue is the biggest downside and nearly had me returning the shoe when I initially bought it. I'd always feel it slide down on my foot and kinda jam itself on top during a run. That issue as mostly gone away or I just don't notice it anymore. The laces are also the standard adizero style and are quite annoying to use at times.

Midsole: Don't really need to say anything about this. Lightstrike Pro with the small shank in the middle is wonderful to run on and has only gotten softer as the miles have ticked up. At 125 miles they are the most comfortable daily trainer I've run in. 

Outsole: I've started to notice a tiny bit of wear on the back of the Adidas white rubber but for 125 miles it's about what I'd expect. The continental rubber has seen zero signs of wear and I can still make out the individual grooves. It has also stayed grippy without cleaning and is amazing to use during a rainy run or after rain. I also have seen minimal scraping on the exposed midsole foam which is wonderful to see.

Score: 8.5/10 
This score is lower than might expect from a glowing review like this but the short and sliding down tongue and bad laces are big downsides if you don't like the Adidas laces.",2025-03-20 16:44:50+00:00,168,130

1jf1qxt,RunningShoeGeeks,Mizuno Neo Zen After 36 Miles / 60km - Bouncy!!,"https://preview.redd.it/947mad82fope1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44bafde2fbdd6bbe93dfd9b69f034113487c7b33

**TL;DR:** I really like this shoe for recovery, easy, and even tempo runs. I even think this shoe is better than the Evo SL. This should have been the Novablast 2.

First, some background about me: I'm a male in my late 20s, 161-162cm tall, and typically hover between 59-62 kg. My PRs are 1:35 for the half marathon (hot climate) and 3:24 for the full marathon (cooler climate). I’ve been running for four years. I typically have a high cadence of >190 and am a midfoot/forefoot striker.

I ran the Osaka Marathon 2025 in late February, and while browsing the large Mizuno booth at the expo, I came across the Neo Zen. I had already heard rave reviews about the Neo Vista but wasn’t compelled to get it. However, when I saw the Neo Zen, I read some online reviews saying this shoe is *bouncy* and a joy to run in. Seeing the word *bouncy* caught my eye. Since the shoe was competitively priced, curiosity got the better of my financial decision-making, and I bought the **Onihayai** colourway exclusive to Japan.

After a few runs at different speeds, all I can say is: this shoe is **SUPER UNDERRATED** and is massively being slept on. Let’s get to the basics.

# Fit

Narrow and surprisingly large. It’s so large that I had to go **half a size down (US 8.5)** from my usual size (US 9). It’s soft and comfortable with a sock-like fit, and the pull tab is well appreciated.

# Upper

Nothing to rave about, but it’s breathable. It has a lot of holes, and the material is soft and cloth-like. There’s not much to say because it just feels standard, which isn’t necessarily good or bad. That said, I appreciate the breathability since I train in a hot and humid climate. After **60km / 36 miles**, it still looks fine.

# Outsole

Looks durable—I'm not worried about wear and tear. I’ve run on wet pavement, and the grip seems solid. After **60km / 36 miles**, the sole still looks great.

# Workouts & Ride

This is the part I really want to talk about.

**YEAH. IT’S BOUNCY. HELLA BOUNCY.**

Every step feels amazing—I felt like I was on a trampoline. It reminded me of the Novablast 1 days—man, that shoe was bouncy as heck. I felt like I was getting so much energy return that running felt effortless. Granted, it’s not quite race-day fast, but it’s fast enough to hit my tempo paces with ease.

I’ve done **two recovery runs, two easy efforts, and one tempo run** in these, and each time, the bounce just keeps on giving. Like other reviewers mentioned, I can confirm this shoe’s midsole is **soft**. The ""MIZUNO ENERZY NXT (NITROGEN INFUSED VERSION)"" they mention on their website? Yeah, it’s *really* soft and responsive. I keep wanting to reach for these shoes every time I have a recovery run, an easy run, or even a slight tempo run. If we’re talking about Pete Pfitzinger’s *Advanced Marathoning*, I’d gladly wear these for my **recovery, general aerobic, and medium-long runs (MLR).**

# Comparison to the Evo SL

I’m comparing these to the Evo SL because the Evo SL is getting hyped as *the* go-to “all-rounder/daily trainer” on social media. I own the Evo SLs and have shared my thoughts on them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/comments/1hjz29o/review_and_thoughts_adidas_pro_evo_sl_adidas/).

But putting them side by side, for whatever reason, I really want to pick the **Neo Zen** more. Yes, I’m happy with the responsiveness of the Evo SL—the quick turnover in workouts, the firm and responsive ride. But when it comes to doing *everything*? Nah, the **Neo Zen takes the crown**.

I really, really love this shoe more than the Evo SL. Both have their own strengths, but man, I just keep wanting to run in the Neo Zen over the Evo SL.

# Final Thoughts

I seriously enjoy these so much. The last time I felt this kind of bounce was when the **Novablast 1** first came out in 2019-2020. I haven’t had a shoe this bouncy until the **Neo Zen** came along. And man, I’m glad I let curiosity make the purchase for me.

I’m definitely grabbing more pairs of these when I get the chance.

This post isn’t as polished as my past reviews, but I just had to write this because I feel like this shoe is **super underrated** and isn’t getting talked about enough.

1jf0k0x,RunningShoeGeeks,"Fans of the Asics Novablast 3 rejoice, the Dynablast 5 is here!","[Novablast 3 vs Dynablast 5 side by side ](https://preview.redd.it/tsokoawteope1.jpg?width=3756&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e3e924ad438281cb81d9de6727ced4a4c6e1645c)

* **Shoe Model & Size:** Asics Dynablast 5, US 9
* **Fit/Comfort Notes:** true to size, comfy and plush
* **Use Case:** road daily trainer
* **Distance Ran:** 25 km so far

About me: 171 cm, 67kg. 5km 21'22"", 10km 44'31"", HM 1:47'41"", I run approximately 125km per month 70/30 split between road and trails.

Being a big fan of the Novablast lineage since its first inception, I was quite disappointed by how it developed into its 4th iteration. I didn't try the v5 yet (waiting for its price to drop) but I am so in love with the v3, that I'm now on my 3rd pair. I can say that the Novablast 3 is easily my favorite shoe ever.

So I was really happy to find out about the Dynablast 5 and it didn't take me long to grab a pair to test out. To cut it short: yes, they're the same shoe. It's no longer the lower stack budget complement to the Novablast line, but it's rather a direct successor of the Novablast 3. Midsole and ousole are identical, though the upper is different. Let's see what changed.

We have a knit material now, it feels stretchier and marginally roomier, but I suspect it will also be a bit warmer in the hot season. Overall the fit is identical to the Novablast 3, I consider it to be absolutely true to size. The tongue is still gusseted, but now it's a more traditionally padded one - nice, but I like the one of the Novablast 3 better. The laces are more basic now, but seem to stay put anyway. Finally Asics also figured out that flat laces work better with flat eyelets, hooray.

The Dynablast 5 heelcup is a bit more padded and resembles the one of the Novablast LE version. Heel hold is more or less on par with the Novablast, but maybe because of the slightly looser fitting upper, it feels a tad less secure here.

One of the nicest features of the Dynablast 5 though is inside the shoe. ORTHOLITE at last! Yes!!! We have Ortholite insoles here! I think this is the biggest improvement over the Novablast 3, because it makes the underfoot feel even more plush and the cushioning more pleasing. Maybe a minor drawback is that the shoe now feels a touch less responsive, but comfort on longer runs is clearly improved.

The changes in the upper resulted in a 22 g weight gain in my US 9 / EU 42.5. Novablast 3 tips the scale at 242 g vs 264 g of the Dynablast 5.

Not much to say about the ride. It's the Novablast 3, plus a tad of extra plushness and a pinch less of racing grit. But safe from this small difference, it remains the same light, bouncy, easy on the legs and all smiles ride of its older sibling.

All that brings me to the conclusion that, as odd as it might sound, the Dynablast 5 is a great complement to the Novablast 3, whereas the former is leaning more to an easy-going kind of trainer and the latter remains the perfect ""long run steady pace to workout"" shoe for me.

One remark about the price: the offical retail price in EU is nonsensical. 130€ is the same as the Novablast 5. I was able to grab my pair on Vinted for 65€ from a user who used them once but wasn't convinced about the size. If you are able to find them at around 100€ or less, it's a good deal.

**I took a break from running from 2021- November 2024 where I got slow and overweight.**

So as this is an older shoe with the NB5 being sold I was not going to carry out a review but I noticed it being sold in my local Asics outlet (UK) on the weekend for £60.00 and due to the price and that it is still available thought a review would be beneficial.

**Fit:**  
The shoe for me fits true to size in terms of the length although it does feel as though it has more volume than shoes like the Adidas SL2, I prefer a bit of a tighter fit across the top of the shoe than the NB3 gave, I would suggest considering maybe half a size down if your current shoe is on the larger side already. That being said I was able to get a really good lock down in the shoe and was a big fan of the gusseted tongue and lacing.

**Feel**  
The shoe has quite a high stack at 41mm with an 8mm drop, I personally usually go for slightly lower stack height on my every day shoes as sometimes find the stability of the shoe can become a problem for me on larger stacked shoes. That being said the shoe feels and is really stable. It is a soft shoe especially in the midsole not to the extent that you feel that you are running in marshmallows but soft enough that you feel that your getting a good level of impact protection which was a big driver for me with my weight especially when I first got the shoe.  
  
It is not the lightest shoe and its not a shoe that I felt become an extension of me such as the EVO SL or for those who remember the Nike epic reacts. I ran up to 15 miles in the shoe and never experienced any discomfort except after one run where the padding on both the heels ended up rubbing away (still not sure how this happened as did not notice it on the run or have different socks on etc)    
  
**Performance**

The shoe was fantastic for easy and long runs where the miles would just disappear and the legs would feel fresh this was a massive thing for me as I was building up mileage volume and wanted to try to protect my legs as much as possible. When working at the tempo range again the shoe was able to hold up however did not feel as slick as shoes such as the EVO SL and Pegasus Turbo and when running intervals or repetitions just didn’t have the pep that I like and need. But as an everyday trainer I don’t think that you can go wrong with it. In terms of grip the shoe has performed well I mentioned the stability earlier, I run predominantly on country lanes where there is a lot of agricultural usage so the roads are a mess and when wet and icy become slick excluding a couple of really icy days I had not issues with the grip of the shoe. I am now 350+ miles in and the upper and the sole are actually in good shape apart from the tearing on the heel, the cushioning is now starting to struggle and on the toe off can feel that its lost some of the structure this is really noticeable at 6+ miles at the moment now remembering that even now I am considered overweight I think the shoe has done well. I am still using it in my rotation but will be using it now for 4-6mile easy recovery runs and utilising the Adidas SL2 more for the longer easy miles.

**Overall conclusions**

This is a really great shoe for its price, if you are looking for a daily workhorse which can cover the majority of your training needs then this would be a great option and at £60.00 if you’re a heavy mileage runner this represents great value. If you are a heavier runner and are looking for something that will provide you cushioning which will last then this is a great option for you. I have also ran in the NB4 but not to this extent of this shoe and actually prefer the NB3. The NB4 definitely feels firmer and slightly more responsive but I found the fit not as comfortable even though it has less volume than the 3 with me struggling on occasion to get as comfortable lock down. I also found that the 4 on the really slow recovery miles to not feel as comfortable.  
  
**Other shoes to potentially consider available now:**  
Adidas SL2 – tighter fit, more responsive but still feels cushioned enough as a heavier runner over longer distances. Handles the faster miles better

Adidas Evo – If your looking for a comfortable well cushioned non plated shoe which can handle interval and rep. This is a tighter fit which I like without feeling restrictive.

Hoka Mach 6 – Great alternative to this shoe which offers comfort at the longer runs whilst being nice and responsive.",2025-03-18 12:53:46+00:00,63,26
1je2uhh,RunningShoeGeeks,Nike Vomero 18 and a little comparison to the Puma Magmax,"About me: 5ft 8, 69kg. 5k 25min, 10km 48min, HM 1.45. Started running in January 2024.

Recently picked up a pair of Nike Vomero 18 (UK size 8) from £115. I've taken them out for two 10k runs so far.

The Good

Comfort - my god, the Vomero are so plush inside - feels like you're putting your foot inside a cushion! Everything just feels so padded inside and my feet feel great after a workout. The shoe fits TTS and there's a nice bit of room especially in the toebox. In comparison, while the Magmax are pretty comfortable, they don't feel as plush.

Cushioning/ride/midsole - The Vomero's are so soft - feels like the softest shoe i've experienced (compared to the Gel Nimbus 25 or Novablast 4). Yet not soft enough to make them feel like marshmallows, and they still retain some bounciness. It feels like a really smooth shoe which can just eat up the miles. Probably not the shoe for speed/tempo running - felt like the weight and the lack of energy return was working against me, but for easy/long runs, i think its just perfect. The Magmax is much more firmer (but still soft) but the energy return is far superior - feel that the Magmax is a more versatile shoe.

The Bad

Heat - think the plushness will make the shoe really hot in the spring/summer - at the moment its still cold in the UK, but i suspect when the temperature goes up, its going to get hot!

Energy Return - think the shoe could do with a bit more ZoomX to make the shoe a bit more bouncier - its lacking in a bit of zip.  i guess they're saving this for the Plus and Premium versions?

Overall - i've really enjoyed the Vomero 18's so far. The plushness and comfort are big positives and its a fantastic shoe for easy and long runs. I have a feeling that the Plus and Premium versions may rival the Magmax as my favourite shoe.",2025-03-18 11:34:44+00:00,211,85

1jdvqol,RunningShoeGeeks,Alphafly 1&3 150-miles review: flawed goat,"**TLDR**: The most amazing feeling shoe for people spending a lot of time on the ball of the foot, but the pods would roll your ankle under load.

Grabbed an AP1 when they started appearing in stores. Never heard of them before, but the step-in was absolutely surreal so I got myself a treat for the advancing hobby.

The first proper long run was the longest I’ve ever done: 17 miles through the streets. The shoe was loud, forcing a lower cadence, the shoelaces would untie 3 times. The foam would somewhat compress during the first 30-60 min making it necessary to tighten the lacing a couple of times. Despite all that, the feeling of running in it was unique and I had next to no typical lower-leg fatigue after.

One day as I was cramming my foot into the tongue-less upper and some of the heel counter rolled over itself creating an immediate and clear hotspot on the top of the heel. Nothing that I couldn’t fix in a minute with a crochet hook but given the price I decided not to cut into the shoe and let Nike deal with it.

The replacement pair that arrived was glued together somewhat sloppy. The outsole stripes on the hill started coming off after the first run. The insole on the right shoe was glued in 1/8 of an inch further towards the left than it should. I eventually cut off some of it to reduce pressure on the inside of the foot.

While I loved the light arch support and fit overall, the arch blisters were annoying. I eventually figured out that it is caused by - the drumroll - the upper that wraps over the bottom of the foot. Fixed it with a blister patch.

The good. I was still thoroughly enjoying the pair! It took me a couple of years to figure out what was so special about it. I spend a lot of time on the mid/forefoot. I land on it at HM pace, I land on it going up and downhill, and I maneuver on the forefoot. And AP1 has superb ramp geometry and great stiffness for that. The pods don't compress as much as the foam does. Meaning that at the moment of highest pressure under metatarsal joints you are still sitting pretty high above the pavement. And the roll is somehow longer. First the joint rolls on top of the pod and then you roll off of the pod. In addition to that, there is plenty of foam under the toes. I tried too many super-shoes and runner-ups that would have great foam but somehow too little of it in front of the shoe where it would actually make a difference. Overall, AP1 and Saucony Speed2 are the 2 shoes with the perfect ramp: starting just behind the metatarsal joints, and keeping a decent amount of foam under the toes.

As I mentioned, I land on forefoot even on downhills. Which is probably not ideal running mechanics. AP1 upper being, well, a sock doesn’t do much to prevent cramming the toes into the front of the shoe. This causes toe blisters; the only lost nail happened to me in the AP1. So, I have to hold myself back on the downhills and emphasize landing more towards the heel in a race.

The shoe feels the most responsive to me at TH and above pace unlike any other. Not that I would recommend running in it at TH pace or above.

Alphafly 3. It is just like AP1 but better in almost every way! Same intense ""this is just right and fun"" impression from the step-in that I didn’t think I’d experience again. They changed shoelace holes so they don't untie as easily anymore. Nike did away with the arch midsole cutout making the roll from heel to toe a little more natural. The fit feels a lot less funky, the upper is not wrapping around the bottom of the foot. The foam is ever so slightly softer, which I wouldn't say I needed but whatever. The only noticeable mechanical difference is that the pods traveled back a little, elongating the ramp and making the shoe ever so slightly less aggressive. This aggressiveness was what gave the 1s most of its magic. If I had an option to buy 1 pair new today I would still opt for the 3s.

The bad. Pods. Even if AP3 outsoles look wide, part of it is plain wider than the pods meaning that not all of the width is effective. Even the pods' width is not all effective due to rounded walls. In other words, I would discount the outsole width by 3/8 inch due to the way it is constructed. So, the footprint is fairly narrow. It takes a fair amount of single-leg coordination to balance on one foot in these. And unlike the foam, pods only get somehow less stable during running. So, no other shoe makes me as intimately aware of the ruts in the pavement. Towards the second half of a HM it means that I have to keep my eyes on the road at all times i.e. no searching through a playlist or running inside a pacer group.

The ugly. Pods again. Close to threshold pace during lateral moves the pods may straight up roll your ankle and they would do it with force. Say, at the water station, the runner in front of you suddenly decides to come to a complete stop and you try to swirl around the person. During the first step, your foot applies more force on the outside (of the foot) and as the load peaks the pod suddenly collapses on this side. And when it collapses on one side it directs more energy into the other side of the pod. This rolls the ankle and it rolls it with force and it with range. And if you don’t control or stop the roll the ankle would just keep rolling. And it would not happen during a casual session, only when you are dropping the hammer. Both times I direly experienced it it was past 10 mile marker. Running in AP1 I rolled an ankle while casually pushing uphill and stepping on a pothole of negligible depth. Had to stop running for a few weeks because of that. And it was not the last time it happened. Let's say, under no circumstances I would do single-leg pogos in these shoes. 

Conclusion: AP1 and AP3 are essentially the same shoe to me. They gave me the most exciting miles I ever experienced, yet the most expensive and dangerous at the same time. The shoe is at its best when running fast but it gets sketchy past the marathon pace. I think it is amazing for runners that can run a full marathon on the balls of their feet. I would highly recommend training in it extensively before racing in it. This likely means that you'd need 2 pairs for a training block which is probably too expensive even for this sub.

1jdtcj6,RunningShoeGeeks,Asics Superblast review after 50 miles (compared to Superblast 2),"**Total distance ran:**

50 miles (80 km)

**Type of runs:**

8-mile easy runs (7:30-8:00/mile), 10-mile steady run (6:50-7:10/mile). All on roads.

**Weather ran in:**

Dry and wet conditions

**My profile:**

Height: 6’0”

Weight: 160lbs

Weekly mileage: 65-70 miles (\~110km).

Strike Type: Shufflle-y midfoot striker

**Positives:**

* Fun and bouncy midsole
* Comfortable upper
* Stable platform
* Great at both slower and faster paces

**Negatives:**

* Outsole cutouts pick up lots of detritus
* Terrible wet weather grip

**Overview:**

I know I'm very late to the party on this one, but after logging 175 miles in the Superblast 2, I've found them to be rather unremarkable. They are firm and not in an Adios Pro 3 responsive type of firm. But more so in a ""these are not pleasant to run in"" firm. In addition, they are cumbersome when trying to pick up the pace.

So I decided I'd give the OG Superblast a try and found a pair at a reasonable price on stockx. And my goodness have they been a delight to run in.

When they arrived, I was struck by how much softer the bottom layer of foam is in the SB1 compared to SB2. Doing easy runs with strides on consecutive days wearing the SB1 followed by the SB2, it was immediately noticeable how much softer, bouncier and more fun the SB1 ride is.

So far, the only area where the SB1 is manifestly inferior to the SB2 is in the outsole. After every run, souvenirs have lodged themselves into the outsole cutouts. And this morning, during a run in the rain, the wet weather grip was terrible, so I won't be doing that again.

**Worth buying?:**

Yes. I'll be logging a lot more miles in these during marathon training over the next few weeks.

1jcr954,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Cielo X1 1.0/2.0 First Thoughts Comparison,"Background: M30 150 lbs, HM 1:35 Daily Trainer: Hoka Mach 6



What I’ve done so far: (2.0) 7 mile break-in run at 8:15 min/mile pace and half marathon at 7:15 min/miles.  (1.0) 10 miles with 5 miles at 9:00 min/mile pace and 5 miles at 8:15 min/miles.



Upper Fit 1.0: Fits TTS.  More snug than the 2.0 on step-in but the material stretches.  Material is thicker and less breathable than the 2.0.  There is no structure around the heel and I did have some minor irritation from the lack of padding on the achilles.  I’m using a version with the updated laces so no problems there.



Upper Fit 2.0: Also TTS.  More spacious and very accommodating toe box.  Material is more plastic-like on the 2.0 and the upper has structure to it, very breathable.  The heel is padded and points out similar to the Mach 6 - which I absolutely loved for a race day shoe.  The 2.0 upper imo is improved in every way.



Midsole/Stability 1.0: Platform is thick and bouncy.  Corners required some slowing down, but downhill felt great.  The lack of structure doesn’t protect ankles as much on uneven landings.  Could feel the carbon plate more under my heels, so landing midfoot was preferable - but not required.  Foam/plate is very protective, and after the first run (5mi fast/5mi easy) I feel like these definitely helped reduce running effort.



Midsole/Stability 2.0: More ground feel on these but still a protective foam (midfoot) platform.  Corners require slowing down and running downhill with the steep rocker was somewhat uncontrollable.  The upper structure combined with forefoot platform width helps the footstrike feel more controlled, BUT there’s nothing to land on towards the heel, so you’re forced onto that mid or forefoot.  Foam and plate still have a nice bounce but the rocker feels much more aggressive here.  Running feels effortless but the geometry can feel harsh on leg muscles.



Pace/Purpose 1.0: My intended use for these will be long runs.  That said, it is a carbon plated “race day” shoe, so it does push you faster than an unplated daily trainer would.  It still felt good at easy effort but it isn’t something I would mindlessly easy cruise with.  It felt best imo at that slightly-faster than easy pace speed.  Picking up the pace felt great but only to an extent, they required much more effort maintaining my HM pace (7:15 min/mile) than the 2.0’s did.  That in-between HM and easy effort pace was the sweet spot (8:15 min/mile) and was my preference.



Pace/Purpose 2.0: You can’t easy run in these, period.  My attempt to do so on my first run defaulted straight to that faster 8:15 min/mile pace.  They feel incredible at that fast pace and completely effortless.  Even at that fast but not quite race pace-effort they beat up your muscles.  These are meant to go fast only and be efficient at doing so.  At race pace these will push you to your limit if you allow them to.



Final Thoughts: I much prefer the comfort of the 2.0, but the aggression makes it a race-effort shoe only.  The 1.0 feels better for training runs, but it’s not as comfortable, and I would not use it for race-efforts.",2025-03-16 17:52:33+00:00,35,6

1jchpvt,RunningShoeGeeks,Comments on the Asics Novablast 5 from a NB enjoyer,"[45km and already dirty](https://preview.redd.it/xgttyp9kv0pe1.jpg?width=1434&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3239c90b8b8f9ec58cae4d6b428a087d5d5caebb)

tl;dr: If you liked the 3, the 5 will work for you.

For one reason or another, I've been using the Novablast line for 2,5 years. I started with the 3, the LE version, and completely loved them. Reminded me of my second pair of Asics ever, the Roadhawk FF (2018, I think). An innovative shoe for Asics, the first one truly available made with the all new FF (FlyteFoam) foam, and one of their first running shoes without Gel.Bought a second pair, also the LE, and put more than 500km on each pair. To be fair, durability was not great. But got the two pairs for around 100€ each, so it wasn't a bad deal.

https://preview.redd.it/9itp4n6mv0pe1.jpg?width=1434&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d497cffe0d3a0673c5edce753cf25d1a33113ff5

I tried the regular version of the 3, but the upper felt a little bit thick or, at least, not as breathable as the LE.After those, I got a pair of the 4. It wasn't a downgrade, but it's a different shoe. More bulky, more padded, the outsole felt more stable but firmer and a little cluncky. Don't get me wrong, I'm still using them as a daily trainer and for long runs. But they don't dissappear in your foot as the 3.

[Same overall shape](https://preview.redd.it/yisy084ov0pe1.jpg?width=1433&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=42837a6d4e6634e5ec4571c998113cf503cc05cf)

[The 4 has a more pronounced rocker?](https://preview.redd.it/go2kj34ov0pe1.jpg?width=1434&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0760b9166bf188e603f6c3f0399b9c61852bbb62)

[The 4 has a wider heel than the 3 and the 5.](https://preview.redd.it/t0jdb64ov0pe1.jpg?width=1434&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5bf63c1004044febcdca295ef1de27695bf98504)

In my search for a shoe to run my first marathon, I got a pair of Endorphin Speed 4 but I made a mistake when choosing the size and I think it was for the best. Boy it's a fast shoe, but my goal is only to finish the race and the shoe it's a little too much for my intended pace. Maybe for HM, if I'm willing to lose a nail or two =D.

[The Roadhawk \(right\) is a 42,5EU \(US9\) and the NB5 is a 41,5, US8.](https://preview.redd.it/xzkmn19sv0pe1.jpg?width=1434&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dab707149423861ee46b73cb155e6ea9c9a221a1)

[Times change](https://preview.redd.it/gwi3t39sv0pe1.jpg?width=1434&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd13545cd70b0adb115f5186e9a3c1dc38ebed60)

So I went for the true and tested Novablast. The 4 it's on their lasts kms, and although you can find new ones in retailers, for basically the same price you can get the 5 from Asics (I'm in Spain, and discounts aren't as wild as in the US).Just did a progressive 15km and a 31km long run, with paces from recovery (6:45/km) to 10k (5:00/km) and they shine. I feel it's a back to form. Springy enough, a tad chaotic, more roomy in the toebox. It is a big shoe, not as nimble as the ES4 or the Deviate Nitro 2, but they just blend in the background and let you do your thing.

Just a couple of naggings:

\- The shoe laces are a bit short

\- What's with the weird loop in the tongue??

\- Non existent grip (but from experience, it will improve).",2025-03-16 09:25:40+00:00,66,67
1jcamvs,RunningShoeGeeks,"Mizuna Neo Vista after 400KMs - inc comparison to Skyward X, Magmax & Supercomp Trainer V1","**My Stats**

181cm tall, 86kg powerlifter/runner, shoe size US12. 40:00 for 10km and 1:28 for half. Mid/heel striker. Slow rolling gait. Mild Pronation.

Reason for buying: New long run shoe

I've had this for about 6 months now and as soon as I got it, I knew I finally got a legit replacement for my supercomp trainer V1s (which I would buy again in a heartbeat if I saw some come up in my size).

**The good**  
The step in feel, the comfort and fit are really good for me.

The ride is soft and heavily rockered. Its surprisingly stable for a shoe this soft and tall.

The weight is good for the stack and it feels MUCH lighter than the skyward X that I purchased at the same time.

The nice part about it, is that even though its not the bounciest midsole around, the lower weight (for a big shoe) means its not too much effort go get going.

For me, this shoe really works as a long run / daily trainer, I can do intervals in it and its not too much effort given that its pillow like for the rest of the run.

I think this works great for anyone that loves a heavily rockered shoe, If you are after a snappy footstrike, look elsewhere.

Pace wise its good for daily miles **above** recovery pace (anything 5:30/km+) , at medium pace (5:30 - 4:45/km) and though doing 1km intervals at 4:00m/km (my 10k pace) - these all felt great,

**The Bad**  
Durability: I'm 400kms in and have completely worn through the inner part of the rubber and what was a stable shoe is no longer so stable - the outsole here provided quite a bit of the firmness and distributes the load amongst the pillowy midsole, once its gone, you kinda just sink (reminds me of the invincible which I did not enjoy).

Also, give the softness, surprisingly its not a great recovery shoe, even in its prime once I got below 6m/km pace where I really heel strike on a recovery run, the heels just sink and calves have to work overtime (kinda defeating the purpose of a recovery run).

Also given the softness means 10k pace (4:00/km) can feel laborious - 10k pace intervals in a workour are fine (I did intervals of 500m - 1000m at this pace)

**Buy again - Yes**  
\- I'll wait for the clearance specials on the v1 when v2 comes out

\- V2 is apparently going to be a little firmer, this could make the shoe even better (esp in the heel) or ruin it.

**Comparison to Skyward X**  
Skyward X is equally (or more) rockered, firmer, much bouncier, but feels MUCH MUCH heavier. I find that with the skyward I need to be going at a higher pace to overcome the weight, when I do they feel great, when I don't they feel rubbish. there is no use case where I prefer the skyward over the Neo Vista (though they are likely to be much more durable if that's your thing)

**Comparison to Puma MagMax**  
Magma is firmer, bouncier, less rockered, but surprisingly works much better at recovery paces, it can pick up the pace a little (its no speed shoe), and is great on gravel/dirt surfaces unlike the Neo Vista. The durability is much better too as is the price. Given how great it is at recovery paces, it will keep on getting used for some time.

**Comparison to Supercom Trainer V1**The supercomp felt very similar, but had marginally better durability (lasted about 500kms for me) and were bouncier. They were heavier, but didn't feel that way. They also felt better and were runnable at recovery pace, whereas the Neo Vista's struggle.",2025-03-16 01:37:38+00:00,49,23

This is the first I'm hearing of this shoe. I guess it's Saucony's attempt at a supertrainer a la Superblast or Zoom Fly 6? It's a little on the heavy side and there is a serious lack of outsole on this shoe with tons of exposed foam like some older Hokas had.

I have serious concerns about the durability and wet weather grip.  It's also more expensive than the Nike ZF6 and Adidas Evo SL.  It's only $20 less than the widely lauded Superblast 2.  Saucony is late to the party with their supertrainer and going by the specs, it looks like the least impressive offering.  I'm seriously confused why Saucony would release such an expensive shoe that falls short of the competition.",2025-03-13 19:30:43+00:00,38,51

1j9dvh1,RunningShoeGeeks,Asics Superblast 2 x Novablast 5,"5’9” Male, 165 lbs, Weekly mileage 25-30~, US Men size 9-9.5 for most shoes. 

Hi! Wanted to share my thoughts on the Superblast 2 with 268 miles on it now and the Novablast 5 after my second run in them for 8 miles total. Personally, picked up running last year to run a marathon with friends but ended up dropping out around a month out. Am determined to lock in this year for redemption. 

Superblast 2 (size 9.5):
- Fit: Snug but not in a bad way. I really liked how it fit overall and was much better than the 9 Wide in the Gel Nimbus 26 that FleetFeet initially recommended when I first started. I have a little under a thumb’s width for my big toe and have had several toenails (second and third toe) go purple on two separate occasions during my longruns. Gotten a size 10 and still felt like 9.5 fit best. No blisters but had some mild discomfort towards the ball of my feet after 13 miles initially. Have not gone further than 16 miles in one run in them and feel like the discomfort is my feet just needing to get used to higher mileage.

-Cushion/ Midsole: Going from a Nimbus when I first started running to the SB was a night and day difference. The shoe felt much lighter, responsive and firmer but it made running feel so enjoyable with that extra bounce. It helped lower how much fatigue i was taking during my longruns and it still feels like its got plenty of pep to give. That was the most surprising thing for me as I just thought initially firmer= less comfort and protection but its been amazing out the box to now. I am far slower than most of the people on the thread and am running at 9-9:30 paces on most of my runs. My favorite pace though for these is under 8:30 where it feels like its really helps open up my strides and propel me forward. Ive also done a 6:47 mile in them as a PB attempt months ago on a whim. Overall, its been a perfect companion for handling runs at any pace for me and I like how versatile it is.

-Stability: Even with such a high stack I didnt have any stability issues and if anything I feel like the firmness of the shoe made it much more stable vs the Nimbus and the Novablast 5. I think its made even more apparent how stable it was for me when I started doing treadmill runs. The firmness made each stride feel more planted and controlled. With the Novablast and Nimbus, I could notice how much more energy I am spending stabilizing my body and keeping me more upright. Nimbus felt too soft and the Novablast felt like it had too much bounce. I thought the SB had the best balance for me with responsiveness and stability.

-Outsole: Super grippy in all conditions. Love how reliable the compound is and wish the Novablast had the same grip. No complaints but am unsure if there is too much wear on them given i am just past 250 miles in them. Hoping they will last me past 400 miles.

-Overall Impression: For a new runner, I feel like this is a do-it-all kind of shoe and would do the job for any workout if you could only have one pair of shoes. Comfort to last through long miles but has plenty of pep to pick up the speed, at least for the paces I can put up lol. Ive been super happy with it and am hoping to put plenty of more miles on them (:

Novablast 5 (size 9.5):
- Fit: Roomier toebox than the SB but not an exponential amount which I can appreciate. Its still snug but gives my toes just the right amount of space for a little bit more play than the SB. Length wise, I got a thumb’s width of room for my big toe whereas the SB is probably more like 8/10ths of that. I do a runner’s loop and felt like maybe the Novablast has shorter laces? Because of that I felt like it was much tighter around my ankles than the SB. Its fine to run in and I havent had any issues with it but its just a bit more tight than I’d like and just seems too short when I tie them. I can tighten up the midfoot more so I can get more lace up top but maybe it will be too tight for me there. I’ll play around with it more and I am sure the fabric will stretch more over time, allowing me to cinch up the shoes more in the midfoot for that extra lace length. 

-Cushion/ Midsole: Softer than the SB and much more bouncy but not as soft as the Nimbus 26. It gives me a nice squish like the nimbus but actually springs back whereas the nimbus felt more like my feet were sinking in. The bounce gives the shoe so much life and its been very fun to run in. Even with the bounce though I still feel like i get more tired in then than the SB since it is softer and I feel like that initial push off saps away a little more energy than the SB because my feet sinks in more. I have only attempted treadmill running in these so far and I do feel like me getting a little more tired in these is probably from me trying to stabilize myself more. This showed me i need to work on strengthening certain areas and probably work more on my strides. I will mention more in depth in the stability section but I felt more wobbly from the combination of the softness and bounce. Despite that, I view this as a refreshing experience compared to the reliable workhorse that is the SB. First run felt more wobbly and my second run in them today felt much better so just probably a little time and adjustment to get used to them will help. I dont think it will be as good for me at handling longer runs than the SB but will see. I havent done anything more than 4 miles in them and will be doing a 6 mile run tomorrow. Wanted to also mention I am running these in the same 9-9:30 paces as I have with the SB.

-Stability: Strictly just running in them on a treadmill, my first run got me wobbling a little and I felt so awkward since it just feels so different from the SB. Its not a bad thing, just different considering I have only ran in these SB on every run from September 2024 till now. I think with some more runs I will feel more comfortable and accustomed to them. My second run was much much better but still not as stable as the SB for me.

-Outsole: Worse than the SB and Nimbus. I would say this is the worst out of the three with the SB at the top. Havent ran in the rain fully but the slight jog from the parking lot to the gym during a rainy day was enough for me to not want to risk it. I see people mentioning its an improvement from the outsole of the 4s but I am not sure by how much. I am curious how fast they will wear out though compared to the SB from outdoor running.

-Overall Impression: Fun and am so excited to test them out a lot more. Got these so I can use the SBs for mainly just longruns only to prolong its longevity. Though its a very different shoe, I think its going to be a solid daily trainer to give me something more to look forward to when running. SB is to me like the shoe I can rely on for anything and everything and the Novablast is the shoe that I feel like is more exciting and fun to just lace up and go. Both are awesome, just very different experiences.

TL;DR - SB is more snug, less bouncy than the Novablast but grippier, more stable, and more comfortable for long miles. Novablast is exciting with the extra bounce but if I could pick one shoe to do any and all runs, itd still be the SB. 

I wish I could just get a bunch more shoes to try out for fun 😩

1j8m4ba,RunningShoeGeeks,Saucony Endorphin Elite 2 - Review + Comparisons,"Saucony Endorphin Elite 2 - Review & Comparisons

stats: M 5’11 70kg fore/midfoot striker + stride-based runner 

Upper/Fit:

The upper is probably the only concern/issue with this shoe. Despite going up half a size from my usual US10.5, I still got blisters on both my pinky toes. The plastic/net-like upper (similar to the VF2) and toebox taper is not a good combo.

To summarise my experience with the upper/fit:

Stay TTS = Toebox is too short and tapers way to aggressively
Go up half size =  I get slightly too much volume in the midfoot and heel, and the stretchy laces create a challenge with lockdown

(Probably the best heel counter on a super shoe though)

Outsole: 

I ran in dry, smooth pavement so had no issues and generally don’t have issues with traction or durability. The rubber is quite sticky/tacky and you feel it ‘stick’ to the road. Durability is up in the air.

Stability: 

I also don’t have stability issues but the shoes are surprisingly stable especially going downhill and taking turns. I’d say they’re better than the PXSv1 and Mizuno WRP3 but not as stable as an AP3.

Midsole/Ride/Performance:

Even with the highest expectations, I was still blown away by how soft, squishy and bouncy these were. They give you that “first time ever wearing a super shoe” feeling. 

I took these on a 3x9km marathon-pace workout (4:00min/km - 3:47min/km). 

During the warmup (usually 5:00min/km), I felt an unreal amount of ‘squish’ then ‘pop’. This, plus the sharp forefoot rocker forced me to run at  4:25min/km (usually the top-end of my steady-run pace) and made it feel like recovery effort.

When running at marathon pace, the shoes quickly match its speed of compression to your pace. The foam would squish and absorb the impact, then it’d decompress and return that energy back while simultaneously kicking me forward with the rocker. It feels like a mix of the bounce of the AF1 with the sharp rocker of the AP3 (plus the softness of a tempur-medic mattress)

However, I could feel either the plate or toe spring while running (both?). It felt like my feet were sitting in a spoon with my toes curled upwards. The feeling did disappear and only returned when I was quite fatigued and in pain because of the toe blisters. I also did experience forefoot chafing/discomfort as well, which could be the result of the plate stiffness/position, but could’ve been caused by the upper loosening towards the end and my foot shifting around.

With the shoe being this soft,  having an 8mm drop and being a stride forefoot striker, I was also worried about bottoming out but the shoe maintained its performance and character throughout the entire workout. 

Overall, the EE2 have easily moved up to the number 1 super shoe spot and has de-throned the AF1.

Comparisons:

AF1: Both shoes have that “I’m running way faster than I should but I’m cruising effortlessly” effect. However, the ride is slightly firmer,  more mechanical and less compliant - comparativey dull. Arch was also a slight annoyance.

AF3: the AF3 is (to me) a more aggressive and duller version of the AF1. Similar performance but even more of a dull ride compared to the EE2. 

AP3: A lot less compliant (squish) but similar level of resilience and rocker. Both shoes ‘kick’ you forward similarly, but the EE2 also has the compliance, softness and bounce to it.

AP4: Similar levels of softness to the EE2 but it’s also less compliant and resilient and bouncy . The rocker is also gentler on the AP4 so these don’t have the same ‘kick’ effect.

OnCloud Boom Strike: Both of these have the same ‘gooey’ softness but the OCBS is much less compliant but still very resilient. Produces similar bounce to EE2 but less fun and very loud and squeaky.

MSP: Much firmer, less compliant but more resilient and nimbler. Prefer these for 5k/10k races and workouts.

PXSv1: Similar levels of fun. Although these are much firmer, they produce similar levels of propulsion and bounce. Hhowever the EE2 is lighter, more stable, comfortable and softer.

Puma FastR 2: Underrated shoe. These also have a similar level of bounce and kick. However much heavier and firmer.

WRP3: Similar level of squish and bounce but only in the heel/midfoot ‘bump’. Whereas, in the EE2, you get the same level of squish regardless of where you land, at a more controllable stack-height plus a rocker that kicks you forward. ",2025-03-11 08:33:46+00:00,166,36

1j7u047,RunningShoeGeeks,"Tarkine Autopilot - a roomer, more stable Clifton.","edit: \*roomier

Purchased in March 2025 for AUD$130 (US$80 !) under their ""Re-Run"" program.  
Perfect, as-new condition. Literally zero wear anywhere.

**Midsole**  
On initial wear, I actually thought this shoe was a dud. Like the person before returned it because it was.  
However, after walking around in it for a day or two, and taking it for an easy grass track session; the foam has really opened up.  
Not as compliant as the Rebel V4s with Fuelcell but still less immediate than the Triumph20s with PWRRUN+  
It might look like it has similarites to the Clifton but the midsole is far more responsive and resilient and doesn't just collapse and lay dead.

**Upper**  
Quite thick, not the most breathable.  
There is a lot of coverage of the upper with sealed vinyl-like material around the midfoot.  
Probably adds to the weight.  
Very secure, very comfortable.  
*Huge* amounts of room in the toe box. I had issues with my Cliftons where my pinky toe would sometimes develop blisters in warm weather because the forefoot was too snug. I can barely get my toes to touch the sidewalls & roof in these.

**Outsole**  
Forefoot looks *very* similar to the Clifton, but has thicker rubber pads.  
Much more coverage around the heel, *very* usable for walking & everyday wear.  
Almost 3mm thick from rough measurement.

**Ride**  
This is a shoe that I wil happily wear all day and then go for a 10K run with mates in.  
The rocker is quite late, so it's stable for standing and the toe spring isn't annoying during all day wear.  
I'm not a heel-striker but the heel bevel is smooth and perfect for walking.  
The heel & forefoot flares are both significant, and really makes it one of the most stable neutral shoes that I have.

It's not the fastest shoe around, but I still managed to crack 85sec 400m x 9 repeats on tired legs.  
I have plenty of other shoes if I want to run faster than mara pace in.

I have already bought another pair for casual wear because of the funky colour edition.

If I were to go on holiday and need one pair of shoes to do travelling & touring jogs/runs in, this is it.

\>> 10mins warmup @ 5:15mins/km 

\>> 5 \* 9mins tempo @ 4:25mins/km (3mins rest jog 6:20mins/km between)

**Overall fit and upper:** 

The new material for the upper is very light, thin, smooth and much more comfortable than the mesh upper from the AP3 and B12.

Laces are short and thin. Runner loops & knots are required to avoid feet sliding slightly in the shoes. No lace bite unlike the AP3 and B12.

I bought the shoes online TTS. It has much narrower toebox than AP3, my big toe can clearly feel the upper fabric and may feel a little tight fit but had no issues while running. If you have a little wide feet than normal, you should size up at least 1/2 size. Length is fine.

The red dye in heel collar sticked into my white socks after the run.



**Ride and midsole:**

Much lighter on feet than the AP3. No bottom heavy feel.

AP4 midsole is very airy, soft and bouncy, I can feel the midsole compress and decompress with a bounce very fast. It is even softer than the midsole of AP3 after 500+kms. (Considering the midsole in my AP3 has been soften a lots).

Much more unstable than the AP3 due to softer midsole, requires more ankle strength to keep the balance. Need to be more careful while taking corner.

The earlier rocker in the AP4 combines with the bounciness made it very hard to run slow in this shoes. I supposed to run at 5:15mins/km in my warmup but I was pushed to run 10s faster each km.

Very consistent, lively, fast performance throught out the workout.

Legs feel fresh, more relax after the run compared to AP3.



**Outsole/Insole:**

Not as grippy as AP3 but still OK, no issue whatsoever. Hardly feel the Continental piece.

Glued insole like AP3 which is great but the printed text on it was scratched/peeled off from just 1 run (probably due to feet sliding slightly / I didn't use runner loops & knots).



**Overall impression:** great performance, a little worry about durability/quality overtime.",2025-03-10 04:48:32+00:00,71,31
1j7m5v5,RunningShoeGeeks,Brooks Aurora BL [Revisited],"About me: 33M, 5'8 and 195 lbs, shoe size 8.5. Lift weights 6-7 times a week and run 3-4 times a week. Preferred distance is 3 miles but sometimes I do push it to 6 or 7 miles if I feel like it. I run for fun and don't usually have a time goal in mind, just kinda run by feels and enjoy the good vibes 🤙

TLDR: I love this shoe so much and please Brooks, work on the next version! 🙏🙏🙏


When shoe was released in 2021 and it was instantly my favorite shoe of that year. This is actually my second pair (I think I got them in 2023) since the first one got messed up on one of my runs. I love everything about shoe: from the upper to the midsole to the way the shoe looks. In fact, I still get asked about the shoe and complimented whenever I rock these shoes for casual wear. The shoe is not on my daily rotation anymore but I still pull it out every once in a while and oh boy, it always puts a smile on my face when I run in it.


The upper holds up really well, hardly anything changed. The upper is very different from Brooks's traditional upper, it feels plasticky but it's still pretty breathable. The fit is perfect for my foot and the gusseted tongue really holds your foot down. What surprises me the most is the upper's durability despite how thin it is. I fell a couple of times in the shoe and rubbed the upper against really tough gravel surface and nothing really happened to it, no fraying, no ripping, nothing. The only thing I can complain about is how this upper traps dust really easily and it takes quite some time to clean it.


The midsole is still by far my most favorite iteration of the DNA Loft 3, it's soft yet bouncy. A lot of people would think that is a recovery shoe or a max cushion daily trainer because of how the shoe looks and they are not wrong. The shoe can be used for a lot of things but I think the shoe really shines at faster pace. At slower pace, the shoe is very plush and accommodating but at faster pace, that foam gets bouncy and provides a good amount of energy return. That combining with the rocker makes the run feel so effortless during those speed workouts. As we all know, the Glycerin was one of the first Brooks shoe lines to get the DNA Loft 3 after the release of the Aurora BL but for me so far, none of them has given the same kind of fun I feel when I run in the Aurora BL. Closest thing would be the Glycerin 21 Stealthfit but even then, the midsole still feels slightly mushy at times. The later Glycerin Max and Glycerin 22 are on the opposite side where the midsole feels firmer and not as balanced as the Aurora BL was. Now let me be clear, these are all great shoes, in fact the Glycerin Max and Glycerin 22 are both on my rotation right now. I just feel like the Aurora BL's DNA Loft 3 somehow didn't translate well to other Brooks running shoes and it sucks I won't be able to experience that kind of fun again since Brooks doesn't want to work on the next version.


The outsole so far looks pretty durable to me, I still ran the shoe a lot up until late 2024 and it seems to hold up pretty well. The only thing I dislike is that the little indentation on the outsoles creates some sort of suction cup effect. It makes those popping sounds on certain flat surfaces and that can be annoying sometimes when walking in it. Other than that, no other complaints.


Overall, it's still one of the best shoes out there and even though it was released a few years ago, I dare to say it still competes really well with other shoes on the market right now like the Asics Superblast or Saucony Endorphin Speed series. I would love to run more in it but I'm trying to slowly savor it because I'm just trying to keep the shoe as long as I can. Again Brooks, if you see this, please release the next version or at least do a rerelease! I know you have it in your secret vault somewhere!",2025-03-10 00:32:07+00:00,89,34

1j5v78l,RunningShoeGeeks,First run in Saucony Endorphin Elite 1,"Male, 26 years old 5’8” 150 lbs, wide flat feet Men’s 9.5, mild heel strike
**Justification for the shoe and use case: Similar to my Hyperion 2 GTS review I was dealing with post tibial tendonitis and wanted to explore some stability options in racing shoes. For now, 10k to half marathon but if my 10 mile at marathon pace goes well, possibly the marathon this May.
**First Run
I wanted to use this for an interval session at threshold. I usually warmup and do this at Maffetone HR of 154 HR for 10 minutes and normally on the hyperion, it would fall at 5:45/km. With this shoe it was just rolling me along with crazy snap and bounce. It was making me go at 5:15/km. After that I did 3x10min, 1min rest at threshold. Each rep I was somehow dropping 4:00/km (180 cadence) and 3:50/km (190) on the last 3. With the hyperion 2 they would be 4:30/km and 4:15/km.
**Is this shoe really only for elites?
 Honestly with these first impressions, it boosts my performance while not feeling harsh and I'm not an elite. I was scared off by that from reviewers and they say how stiff the shoe is. However after owning the Saucony Tempus 1, there can be a difference between stiff and harsh. The tempus was stiff, harsh and performed around the same as the hyperion.
**Who is this shoe for?
I think if you like stiff shoes and want stability in your super shoe. To me it feels like a stability meta speed edge paris. The edge paris was way too unstable for me.
**Fit, Upper, Laces, Grip
Ok so this was on sale and I took the risk to get a women's size 11 which is equivalent to a men's size 9.5. I couldn't find any information on the width but the elite is a wide shoe in general and if the women's were to be narrower it would have been fine because the meta speed edge paris is a narrow fit but I fit that men's 9.5. The fit ended up being perfect. Has half a thumbs width to the front and pinky toes were not hitting the sides. At times my right pinky toe would get sore in the edge paris. Upper, I can't say much but I don't notice any rubbing. I also can't just put the shoe in directly like say the hyperion 2, I need to untie and tie them. Laces: I guess they're ok...? They don't have the sawtooth pattern like the hyperion or alphafly. Grip: Seems fine, I was going speeds faster than I ever did and I didn't feel like slipping on the track.",2025-03-07 17:57:07+00:00,195,41

1j4tuoo,RunningShoeGeeks,Another Saucony Endorphin Elite 2 Review,"https://preview.redd.it/kaozbch462ne1.jpg?width=3001&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d9e46c85872f38ebda01c0175fffe5843f0f135

Not really a reddit poster, but thought I’d share this short review of the Saucony Endorphin Elite 2 as one of the few people who's had the opportunity to have them available through a full marathon training cycle and race a marathon in them.

After having the good luck to grab a pair of these Saucony Endorphin Elite 2s from the tiny drop in June and sitting on these for nearly six months, I finally got to use them in a marathon in December. And they are sublime, my absolute favorite shoe for the marathon so far. By a wide margin. Yes, exceptionally soft. And also very fast and efficient at any pace I've tried.

The fit is very similar to the Saucony Endorphin Elite 1, which is mostly generous yet well held. The toe box is a bit less spacious than the 1, but only by the most marginal amount. Other than that, fit and hold are exceptional both through the midfoot and the heel. I came out of my marathon without a hint of a hot spot or blister or black toenail. My toes aren't even sore. The ride is weirdly forgiving. Run with pace, and it offers pace back. Run easier, and it rolls along efficiently and protectively. Get up on your toes, and you fly. Tire a bit and fall back on the heels, you still fly. Explosive, yet easy going.

I would name two cons, one itsy bitsy and one small (but potential a bigger deal on certain courses.) The itsy bitsy one, the toe bumper is pretty stiff. For a few minutes during my race, I noticed what felt like my toes bumping against it. The noticing was there and gone so quickly I barely remembered it. The small con, this shoe is super soft. Corners are not its strength. My marathon course had two 180 degree turns and I had to be very deliberate about navigating them. But then the shoe becomes surprisingly stable while moving in a straight line, so it's really only a problem through tighter corners. And a third consideration, the foam is so soft that I can occasionally feel the plate on the forefoot. It's not uncomfortable or problematic, just a surprising sensation of firmness in all this pillowy softness. I only noticed this occasionally in training, not at all during my race.

Fast, efficient, protective, wildly comfortable, and now my PR shoe. What's not to love! I'll be buying another pair for the Chicago Marathon next year once the shoe fully drops. This shoe is special! Like the first time putting the Nike OG Vaporfly 4% on back in 2017/2018.

Perhaps helpful notes about myself to make the review more meaningful: 6'1"", 170lbs, 2:54 marathon PR, 70ish miles per week on average, alternate between mountain ultramarathons and road marathons every six months wear size 11.5 in most shoes. Other supershoes I've used: OG Vaporfly, Vaporfly Next 1, Alphafly 1 & 2, adidas Adios Pro 2 & 3, Saucony Endorphin Pro 1 & 3, Saucony Endorphin Elite 1, Puma Deviate Nitro Elite 1, adidas Prime X 1 & 1 Strung & 2 Strung.",2025-03-06 11:58:12+00:00,84,53
1j4mh8i,RunningShoeGeeks,Saucony Triumph 22 510 mile review,"•	Shoe Model & Size: - Saucony Triumph 22 11.5 US Men’s

•	Fit/Comfort Notes: I have fairly flat feet and have worn arch supports in the past. These shoes fit me perfectly right out of the box, and were much more comfortable without insoles than with. My feet are also pretty wide and I have struggled with other brands to get shoes that are an appropriate width (Nike in particular) These are great for my feet and I occasionally wear them to work because they’re so comfortable. 

•	Use Case: Daily Trainer (not race shoe)

•	Distance Ran: 510 miles

•	Reason For Buying: I wanted a stiffer shoe after exclusively running in Hokas. When my last pair got shredded I decided to change it up and found these to be the most comfortable for my gait right out of the box. 

•	Profile: 5’9, 153, Heel/Mid Striker. Run about 35 MPW around 7:40 min/mile

•	Pros: These are by far the most durable shoes I’ve ever worn. 500 miles in and there is only some minor wear on the soles. They still are plenty springy and comfortable, and feel pretty close to how they did when I purchased them. They have withstood rain and snow with no trouble. I suspect they’re good for at least another 200 miles. They are fairly versatile as well - I have run long distances (17+ mi) in them and found the extra cushioning to be very useful. However, when training for races they still feel responsive enough to make fast paces feel comfortable.

•	Cons: Can feel a bit soggy when running at race pace. I would definitely never wear them for an actual race. 

•	Shoe comparisons:  
	⁃	Hoka Clifton - The durability difference between these two is not even close - he soles on my Hokas were completely worn after 230 miles. The Hoka’s were comfortable but lacked the springiness/responsiveness of the Triumphs. 
	⁃	Brooks Glycerin GTS - I ran a couple times in these and found them to be much too stiff for my liking right out of the gate. 
	⁃	Saucony Endorphin Pro 3 - Obviously a completely different shoe. I train in the Triumphs and race in the Endorphins and find that the transition is a good fit for me. These have a much lighter weight and provide much more bounce due to the carbon plate. 
	⁃	Saucony Triumph 21 - I recently bought these to see if they’d be a suitable replacement for the 22’s and found them to be much too stiff for my liking. There is a noticeable increase in cushion in the 22, especially in the heel. I suppose for some this could make the 22 feel clunky, but I prefer it to the 21. 

TL;DR: Barring any unforeseen changes, I will probably never buy another training shoe again! These shoes rock and have given me the most bang for my buck of any shoe I’ve worn.",2025-03-06 03:39:02+00:00,77,18
1j4kyqm,RunningShoeGeeks,Vaporfly 4 First Run,"Background: I am a 17m, I run 15:35 for 5k, 35:43 for 10k, and 76:40 for the half. I have been running for about 3 years and I forefoot/midfoot striker. I have had experience with the VF2, VF3, TS9 and the Metaspeed Sky Paris, my current race shoe

Upper: This is honestly the weak point of the shoe, it is no where near as comfortable as the VF3. I experienced some pain on the outside of my foot for most of the run. I had similar issues with the TS9, but after I broke in the upper those issues went away, so I would expect similar things here. Heel lock down, and foot security in general is also pretty good, it's a decently padded heel collar and I had no issues with heel slip or rubbing on my Achilles. One final note, Nike has gotten ride of the saw tooth laces and now use some sort of stretchy laces which aren't great, very similar to those on the AP4 imo.

Ride: I took these out for 10 x 400 at mile pace. I'll be blunt, these things are absolute rockets. The best way to describe it is a cross of the TS9 and the Sky Paris. They are super snappy through toe off, the rocker isn't super noticeable but they have the fast, snappy turnover the TS9 have. The foam is pretty similar to the Sky Paris, hence the comparison. It works super well to add a little bounce on toe off, something I thought the VF3 was missing. It also doesn't bottom out like the VF3 or Sky Paris. However, I am pretty light so heavier runners might struggle with bottoming out. Another headliner for this shoe is the weight and slightly lower stack height (35mm). I definitely felt the weight, it helped massively with the turnover. The stack is not super noticeable though in my opinion, the foam is so soft and bouncy the road kinda gets tuned out. It has less ground feel than the VF 3 so I would expect people will have no problem taking these up to the marathon.

Outsole: Nothing to write about, maybe a little less grippy than the 3, but not a super noticeable amount. Nike has kept the same out sole layout as before, a little more akin to the VF2 than 3 though. It definitely won't have issues on any of the terrain in the typical road race. However, I think durability could be a huge issue, especially in the heel. I am already seeing decent wear in the heel rubber patches. However, the exposed foam is holding up fine, surprisingly.

Verdict and Comparisons: These are a great update to the VF line. They fix most of the issues of the VF3, aside from the stability. The ride is far more aggressive and exciting which I think people will appreciate over the more analogue ride of the 3 or the super mechanical ride of the AF3 (they are fun though). Other than the upper and laces, these are truly spectacular and would probably be my race day pick at the moment.

1j4772w,RunningShoeGeeks,Neo Vista at 250 miles/400 km,"Context: I’m a heavier runner, around 190 lbs/86 kg. Hybrid athlete-type. After a few years of running and a lot of fun 13.1–and-under racing, I’m currently in the peak week for my first marathon on March 29.

I picked up the Neo Vista last fall because, honestly, I thought it looked really cool. Weird, but cool. I still feel this way. It feels like it comes from outer space, and apparently that’s the aesthetic I seek when browsing running websites.

Anyway, I wanted a nice long run shoe to help me through the increasing weekly miles, and the Neo Vista has proven itself to be SO MUCH MORE than “just” my long run workhorse.
I’m feeling like lately there is this emerging idea that the Neo Zen is better than the Vista, that it takes what the NV does well and offers it in a more streamlined and cost-effective package. I’m not here to argue that, as I haven’t had the pleasure of running in a NZ yet. But I do want to give the NV some love, because BOY does it deserve it.

The Neo Vista, for me, hits that exact sweet spot between fun and cushion. It’s so supple and comfortable, with stack for days, but it also almost always feels like it wants you to pick up the pace a little bit. For 80% of my runs, that’s exactly what I want: to feel like I could go faster if I wanted to, but at a nice low tempo pace I can just cruise for hours.

It’s not a particularly aggressive shoe, but I have speed day shoes I whip out for those moments. But when you open up the hips and let it rip, the Neo Vista is VERY happy to oblige.
It is not a good recovery day shoe, I will say that. The insane stack and pillowy landings might suggest it, but its geometry is just not set up for very slow paces. I find anything over 9:30/mile (5:54/km) is pretty hard to maintain in these.

Anyway, about that geometry. I’ve settled into a super neutral, really comfortable midfoot strike with these that I love. The shoe just rolls me through and pops me forward so effortlessly. It really does feel like the shoe makes me run better, mechanically.

As you can tell from the wear on the outsole, I’ve got a bit of supination going on. But that’s always an issue for me due to high arches. Stability-wise, the NV took a little getting used to (especially in corners). It’s the highest-stack shoe I’ve run in, so I had to get used to that feeling of being so high off the ground. But now that I’m used to it I find it to be a very stable neutral shoe; I even run trails with it from time to time!

That’s actually why my “old” pair is covered in mud today: I was having so much fun on my 10-miler yesterday I decided to slosh through some trails on the way back.

To that end, the outsole grip is wild on these. They have seen me through a New England winter, taken me through Montreal during a snowstorm, run on sandy beach paths in Florida, and everything in between. I haven’t lost traction a single time.

Anyway, all this is to say that I’ve decided to run my first marathon in them. I’d been planning on picking up a super shoe, but I love these super trainers too much to abandon them at the start line. I picked up a second pair in that sick (also slightly ridiculous) oni colorway, and I’ll be phasing them in over the coming weeks so they’re nice and broken in for the marathon.

But my old pair is still feeling AMAZING after 250 miles of hard marathon training. Maybe a tiny bit less explosive, but honestly I can’t really feel it. I guess I’ll know once I take the new pair out.

Given how well they’ve held up, I can easily see myself saving these for easier long days and taking them to 500 miles/800 km.

Maybe if I do a second marathon I’ll go the super shoe route, who knows? But for now, I feel very happy having these trusty, ridiculous, wonderful shoes strapped to my feet. I know they’ll see me through, and I know they’ll put a smile on my face.",2025-03-05 16:34:31+00:00,190,122

1j2qdn6,RunningShoeGeeks,Topo Cyclone 2: My thoughts after 800km,"Just yesterday I finally reached 800kms, after buying them in July 2023. Me: M21, 54kg, 167cm. Mostly racing HM (\~1:25 PB), sometimes Marathons (\~3:05 PB).

# Usage

I bought them as a replacement for my daily trainers, which at that time were Hoka Mach 5s. This is also how I used them: Mostly easy runs, some longer, some quicker, but nothing too special. My longest run in them was around 21kms and my fastest a 5k race; the average pace in them over the 800km is 5:39/km.

# Fit

I usually wear EU42 in most brands, sometimes even 42.5 if they are tight in the forefoot. The Cyclone is a very wide and accomodating shoe and I should have sized down to 41.5.

I sometimes have problems with my achilles in some shoes and usually wear orthopedic insoles; here I did not have to do that because of the special insoles by Topo and I never had any problem with it.

# Performance

I feel like the Cyclone 2 performed pretty well as a daily trainer. Straight out of the box, I found them not too bouncy and not too much fun, but they were a stable shoe in my rotation that I could rely on. Actually, maybe it was good that they were not inviting me to go too fast.

The ride did not change much over time (at least I can't really tell) and they did not bottom out. I never had any issues with them feeling more lifeless than usual ;)

In the cases were I did speed up, they also served me very well. They are lightweight and feel pretty fast, minus a carbon (stiff) plate.

In my longest run in them I did notice the ""low"" stackheight afterwards. My feet felt more beaten up than in other shoes, but I don't think they are made for this anyway and they certainly did not hold me back.

# How they held up

The upper held up fine! The mid- and outsole look a bit more run down, as is expected. The outsole held up until 700kms, that was when I started to run on foam (at least on the lateral side).

What I just noticed is that on the left shoe, the upper has dissolved(?) a bit. Probably the result of the shoe being to large for me, so it bent more than usual in that spot.

I retired them now due to the outsole rubber dissolving at the front / middle and them being slippery when not on pavement.

The rubber at the heel is still as new, so I will get some more time out of them when walking.

# Would I buy them again?

No, but that is because I don't buy shoes twice, unless they are really something special ;)

I think for their relaitvely low price, they are a pretty versatile and reliable shoe with great value. Now I will use them as my regular walking shoes until my next daily trainer is retired.

# Comparisons

* Hoka Mach 5: The Mach 5 is way more bouncy and fun; but I found it bottomed out after \~500kms. The Cyclones are much more comfortable to wear though.

* Evo SL: Same deal as with the Mach 5: Evo Sl = fun; Cyclone = comfortable to wear.

* New Balance Rebel v4: I feel like the Rebel is actually relatively close to the Cyclone. This will be my replacement.

* Hoka Mach 6: Also the same deal as with the Mach 5.

* Asics Novablast 3: Overall kinda similar, but for me the Novablasts felt worse in all regards. They were not very comfortable or versatile and I choose to sell them pretty quick. Cyclone all the way!

1j2d0gf,RunningShoeGeeks,Asics Novablast 5 inital thoughts after 30 miles (Comparing to Succony Triumph 20/21),"My specs:

\- 6ft 2in

\- 170lbs/77kg

\- Paces ran using this shoe: Moderate/easy pace 7:30-9:00min/mi or 4:40 - 5:35 min/km

\- Mid striker

I bought this shoe in my usual size 11, fits very well with a wider toe box for me toes which I appreciate. First impressions in the Asics store was how insanely soft the foam was. 

My hopes for this shoe was that it would be a good recovery shoe and a good long run shoe that I could rotate with my beloved Succony Triumph 20 (retired at 600mi/965km) and 21.

After running in these shoes for about 30 miles now I think it's an incredibly fun shoe. The midsole is super bouncy and surprisingly stable. HOWEVER for me the bouncy-ness and the soft cushion starts to flatten out for me after around 6mi/10k. And I'd usually let the shoe rest after the run for at least a day or two for the foam to decompress and for the next run it'll have it's bouncy ride again. Has anyone with the NB5 noticed this with their pair? Idk if it's just my feet are getting tired because they start to hurt in these shoes after said distance. Or maybe I'm too heavy for the shoe?

How does the NB5 compare to my Triumph 20/21?

In terms of ride I thought the Triumphs were bouncy but the NB5 is noticeably bouncier and softer. However as I've said the NB5 starts to bottom out and lose bounce during my longer runs. My Triumphs on the other hand, the foam while soft, is firmer then the NB5, and keeps it's nice cushioned ride throughout the entirety of my long runs. 

Outsole: the Triumph outsole is a tank, 600mi my Triumph 20s and it now my walking shoe. It's too early to tell but from what I heard I don't think these NB5 can even come close to lasting as long as my Triumph 20. In terms of grip, I've ran with Triumphs in the rain and had no problems with grip until like 500-550miles or so when my treads were starting to go flat. Can't really speak for the NB5, been running with them in dry conditions but I've heard wet grip isn't the best in the NB5.

Upper: NB5 wins here, it's light and very breathable, with my Triumph it has a slightly bulky upper can get a bit hot but still comfortable.

Plans for the NB5, will probably use this shoe for easy runs less than 6mi/10k. In terms of pace it can handle easy slow paces well, but when running at a more moderate  pace is when I really feel more of bouncy-ness of the shoe making it super fun to run in. 

Overall a great shoe, was a bit disappointed on how it handled my long run but other than that fun shoe!

1j208ln,RunningShoeGeeks,Adios Pro 4 - Initial Thoughts Review After HM Race,"**Total distance ran:** 23 miles / 37 km
**My profile:** M32, 184 cm (6 ft), 79 kg (174 lbs), UK 9, forefoot striker
**Type of runs:** First run 10 miles, 1km on, 1km off workout to get a feel for HM pace. Second run full on half marathon race.
**Weather ran in:** Training run in heavy downpour around 10°C. Race around 3-4°C dry with icy patches.

---

**Positives:**

- Very good energy return from the foam.
- Rod system propulsive, but with a bit of torsion flex which is welcome.
- Does not dictate unnatural mechanics.
- Breathable upper. Dries quickly after rain as well.
- Gusseted tongue - easy to put on.
- Easy to clean.
- Very good grip.
- Geometry feels familiar after training in Evo SL.
- Pricing - bought for £185 on launch.
- Very good looking.

---

**Negatives:**

- Lacing system improved from AP3, but still poor.
- Instant lace bite issues if tied slightly too tight.
- Heel counter poorly designed - major achilles irritation issues.
- Very unstable in tight corners.

---

**Context for buying:**

I bought these for my spring marathon. I am aiming for 3:45 finish. Today was my 'B' race - a half marathon where I aimed for a 1:40 finish and finished in 1:40. Previous HM PB was 1:43 in the Vaporfly 3. 

Previously raced in: Vaporfly 3, Vaporfly 2 and Alphafly 1. I tried quite a few other racing shoes such as Adios Pro 3, Endorphin Pro 3 and others but they didn't work for me and I sold them on very promptly.

I like a bouncy midsole where I can land on the forefoot and bounce right off. My perfect idea of a race shoe was always the OG Alphafly. I am still looking for a worthy replacement but nothing came close so far.

I bought the shoes on the same day as the Evo SL but kept them in a box until last week. This review is my initial thoughts after one 10 mile workout and the HM race. I am not yet decided if I will take them for the full marathon distance - to be decided in a 20 mile long run soon.

---

**Upper, fit and comfort:**

I will start by saying that I am normally a UK 9 in most running shoes, including the Evo SL. I initially ordered a UK 9 but found it too small. Only then I looked at the sizing chart to find that with Adidas the UK 9 translates to US 9.5 and not US 10 which I'm used to. If we went by the UK sizing, I'd say I had to size up. If we go by US sizing, I went TTS.

The fit is very much a race fit. I have narrow feet and felt very snug. Folks with wider feet will likely find this shoe too narrow.

Upper is made of a nice breathable material. On my first run I got completely soaked and then dried in repeat downpours about three times. No sloshy feeling or soaking up water. Water escaped and the shoes and dried as soon as it got wet. They got quite muddy as well but to my surprise the white fabric didn't stain at all. I cleaned them under the sink with a toothbrush in 2 minutes and they looked brand new at all. Very welcome surprise as I was worried about getting them all muddy on the first run.

Unfortunately it all goes downhill from here. The lacing, although improved from AP3 which I just couldn't run in, is still quite bad. This morning during my pre-race warm up I had to stop about 4 or 5 times to re-do the laces. It takes the tiniest movement to go from ""too loose, shoes escape from under my feet"" to "" too tight, my feet hurt from the laces"". Very, very fine balancing game. On my first run I got lace bite so this time I made sure I didn't screw up as I knew I wouldn't have a chance to stop and adjust mid-race. In the end it was fine but I had to heel lock one of the shoes.

Next major flaw is the heel counter (see pic 3). Material bunching up, visible stitching against the back of the heel. On first run I felt a bit of irritation but as my laces were tighter it wasn't so much of an issue. During the race this shredded my achilles and left painful marks on my skin. Not to blood which is why I'm still giving them a chance for the marathon, but not great either. I don't understand why Adidas and Nike continue to design heel counters like this. I'd much prefer to have the Evo SL heel counter on the Pro 4.

Also the red fabric stained my white socks which at first I thought was blood, but it turned out to be  dye from the heel counter.

Adidas still have a lot of work to do in the upper department. The changes were welcome but this upper is not necessarily something I'd want to wear for a marathon.

---

**Midsole:**

This is my facourite part of this shoe. I found the AP3 a bit dull. They were fast but nothing to write home about. This foam feels completely different. Softer, more bouncy. It now pairs very well with the rod system. If you remember my review of Evo SL, I very much enjoyed the fun ride, but complained about lack of directional rebound. This is completely remedied in the Pro 4. The foam works in perfect harmony with the rods to provide a fun, bouncy ride but also propels you forward in a nice, predictable way.

The ride of the shoe felt very natural for a supershoe of this caliber. I often feel that the modern supershoes try to dictate how you run an put excess stress on certain muscle groups. I felt no such thing in these shoes. My legs feel very fresh regardless of just doing an all out half and being in middle of a marathon block. Very positive. It would benefit from something simillar to the Nike's air pod under the forefoot to add extra bounce but one can only dream.

My only gripe is that on the out and back part of the route at the turn around point, I almost lost balance. Very unstable in tight corners. Slow down and take it easy if you don't want to hurt your ankles. Shouldn't be an issue in big races without tight corners though.

---

**Outsole:**

Very funny suction feeling initially. They literally feel like sucking in on some flat surfaces. Only felt this while walking and during warm up. It disappeared when I picked up the pace.

No issues on wet tarmac. Also no issues on a few icy patches this morning. Very solid and trustworthy outsole. No visible wear so far either.

---

**Worth buying?**

Generally yes. Great value at £185, even at RRP I'd say it's a good value race shoe. The upper is still annoying but bearable unlike the AP3 was. If only they fixed the annoying lacing and heel counter, this model would be an absolute banger.

Additionally, the combo of Evo SL and AP4 presents a great marathon training offering at the combined price of £350 which is much less than other brands.",2025-03-02 20:15:16+00:00,146,95
1j1wex9,RunningShoeGeeks,Nike Pegasus Plus x Adidas Evo SL,"Contextuals:
I am a 190lbs mid/forefoot striker. I have taken both shoes out for a variety of runs and paces. Why these two? They have a similar place in the market with similar technologies in place. Longest run in the Peg+ was 16km and 24km in the Evo SL. 

Both shoes have a minimum of 50km in them. 

My marathon PB is 3:28 and I have run a 20:04 5K. 

The Ride:
Pegasus Plus: 
In a word...ground feel, which is not what I was expecting from this shoe. It mostly is a result of the 10mm drop(hate) making the forefoot a lower stack in a soft foam. The heel feels much firmer than the forefoot so it may work for heelstrikers. The shoe had a break in period, kinda hated it during said period. 

Evo SL:
Flexible Adios Pro 3. That's the pitch. Everything you love about the Adios Pro 3 but no rods or carbon making it more flexible in the midsole and ludicrously bouncy and energetic. Wildly fun to run at all paces in. ""Endless Foam"" is the best description I have heard. 

Winner: Evo SL.

Upper/Lockdown:
Pegasus Plus: 
First experience with Flyknit and I am a fan after a fashion. Probably my favorite part of the shoe. Drains great in wet weather, breathes wonderfully, and holds the foot in place well. Heelcounter is stout and well padded around the ankle. No issues after my first run dialing it in. Tongue is good but slides around just a little bit. 

Evo SL: 
Breathable, and comfortable. It is nothing to write home about and scrunches a bit on the sides but you don't notice it once you are on the run. Locks down well, strategic passing around the ankle and a significantly better heelcup than the Pro 3 but that is not a tall bar to clear. Tongue is great so shimmies or sliding around for me, no lace bite, one of the best tongues from the Adidas Adizero line. (Again not a tall bar to clear). 

Winner: Pegasus Plus.

Price Point:
Pegasus Plus: 😬

Evo SL:
Cheaper than the Endorphin Speed 4 and more bang for you buck. 

Winner: Evo SL.

Outsole:
Pegasus Plus:
High Abrasion rubber, it is holding up well to the wear and tear I tend to lay down. They are a little louder than I prefer from my running shoes but I have not had any issues on sandy sidewalks,, rain, and sunshine. 

Evo SL:
Continental Rubber, same setup as the Pro 3 so if you know you know. Lasts forever, great in all conditions you will encounter road running. Great grip cornering at pace and does not lose traction when I am really digging my toes in. 

Winner: Tie. They both perform well and I wont hold the slappyness of the Peg against it.

Overall Winner: Evo SL",2025-03-02 17:37:40+00:00,278,88

1j1v31b,RunningShoeGeeks,Brooks Hyperion 2 GTS First Run Review,"
Male, 26 years old 5’8” 150 lbs, wide flat feet Men’s 9.5, mild heel strike 


**What I use this shoe for: 
Mainly Intervals on the track, easy runs, daily walking - I think they look great for casual wear 


**Justification for the shoe: 
I was suffering from post tibial tendonitis on my right ankle because I was being reckless on the track using super shoes like the Saucony Endorphin Pro 3 doing 8x1000m, 1min:30s with some reps being at 3k, 5k pace as opposed to 10k pace. 
Having a bouncy platform at speed under fatigue is not doing me any favours for excessive pronation.

Bring in the Hyperion 2 GTS: lower to the ground at 27mm, has the GTS guide rails, light weight around 7.5 oz in my size 


**First Run:
8x1000m at the track, 1min:30s rest 
First 6 reps at 10k pace 4:40/km
Last 2 reps at 3k pace? 4:15/km 
These reps are around 178 cadence and 185 for the last two.  

They felt amazing! I think it has the good amount of bounce and surprisingly little ground feel as opposed to say a Takumi Sen 10. 
The feeling of the foam felt like light strike pro in the Sen and Adios Pro 3 so on the stiffer side. However due to the rods in those they feel snappier for sure. 
The stability is great too! If it’s not aggravating the pain on the medial side that tells me it’s reducing the pronation in contrast to the Sen which is unstable and gives pain in that area.


**Compared to other plateless shoes I used:
Saucony Tempus: The other stability tempo option. I ended up returning them. They felt harsh to me for easy runs and track intervals for some reason. Very stiff ride that gave the sensation my shins were gonna be in pain and made my right arch sore doing an easy run.
Topo Cyclone 2: Despite having similar stack height of 27mm the cyclone definitely has more noticeable ground feel and cyclone is more flexible. 


**Who is this shoe for?
Those who want a light weight, lower to the ground shoe and want stability for tempo and interval workouts. Id imagine like the new balance rebel v3 it would be fantastic on the treadmill. 


**Fit, Upper, Laces, Grip
Literally fits perfect, big toe has at least a thumbs width of space and pinky toes don’t feel like they’re banging on the side. The upper looks good and heel collar allows you to just put the shoe in right away laced up. In contrast to the Sen I need to untie and tie to get it in. Laces are like the alphafly laces so a 10/10 for that. Haven’t tested this for rain but it feels grippy.

1j0d5sp,RunningShoeGeeks,Rebel 4 915km review/Mach 6 first impression,"I retired my Rebel 4s after 915km, here’s my thoughts. 

I ran in v2 and v3 and absolutely loved both of these versions. Great, speedy shoes with ground contact but cushy enough which made this shoe super versatile for me. Now for the version 4 - I had super high expectations. 

Rebel 4 is great by all means but its a slight downgrade from previous versions for me. Why? It is more cushioned but at the same time felt less bouncy. It also gets noticeable flatter around 600km and I dont remember this feeling with previous versions this early. I am a lightweight runner tho so I rarely retire shoes earlier than 700-800km. 

Also the way they fit is odd because its short in lenght I think. I wanted to size up but I was Swimming in bigger size so went with my regular size and I would get feeling of sore big toes when I would run over 15km so I kept my runs in these below this distance. Overall it is still a Great shoe that I can only recommend but having said that imo previous Rebel versions were better. 

I just did my first run in Mach 6 which replaced Rebels and I am impressed. I had Rincon 3 in 2022 and I absolutely hated that shoe so Hoka was a no no for me for some time. After reading reviews I thought that Mach 6 could actually work for me.. additionally it was on sale for around 95 € and ya it  does for me! 

First impression is Great - lightweight, bouncy, cushy, responsive, comfy. I did some warm up and cool down kms today and also 600m reps around 4:00/km (15km in total) It felt responsive at fast segments but protective enough at slower pace. 

This shoe can definitely be your daily and/or tempo shoe as it is very versatile. I need to get more runs in Mach 6 but I have a feeling I will like this one tiny bit more than Rebel 4! ",2025-02-28 17:27:00+00:00,153,67

1j09ft7,RunningShoeGeeks,Saucony Endorphin Elite 2 - Running Perfection,"Weight and size:
I use a US Men's 11 and the shoe weight 220 grams on my scale. Picked up this shoe as my 2025 race shoe.

Upper: The upper is also 1 piece that dissapeared on the run. I never had any issues with width or length but I will note it is a bit shorter so if you have very long feet you'd want to try it on in-store first before purchasing. Laces are perfect and aren't too elastic while not creating any pressure points like with adidas lacing.

Midsole: The best part of this shoe is this foam. Walking in it before running it felt incredibly unstable and it still mostly did on the run. Note is that you should make sure you have good ankle stability. Cornering with this shoe can be a little sketchy but isn't too dissimilar to the Alphafly 3 in that sense. As the run progressed it felt like the foam got a bit stiffer, not to an extreme but felt closer to the AdiosPro 4 by the end then the squishy marshmallow feel at the beginning. It has a bit of that sensation you got with the old vaporflys with how much the shoe compresses and shoots back. The carbon plate wasn't that noticeable which was a bit of a surprise. Definitely felt it working but could ever feel it like I can in my Adios Pro 3, Cloudboom Strike, or ZoomFly 6.

Outsole: I wish I could give more thoughts here but my run was on a dry road with no puddles so I never got to see how it worked wet. But I will say that it was grippy in the dry and certainly and improvement over the previous saucony outsoles. 

Ride: I'm adding an extra section to explain the ride of the midsole and shoe in general. The lateral side cutout is very nice and you never notice it and it helps making sure I don't roll inwards with my foot. It is a very smooth ride. One thing I disliked largely about the original Elite 1 and the Alphafly 3 is that they felt mechanical in a sense. You didn't feel like you were running and that the shoe was doing a lot of the work for you. This foam and midsole design on the Elite 2 feels incredibly natural and at HM pace it felt like no effort holding a steady pace and just cruising.

Score 9.5/10
 -0.5 stability on corners
This score may be different in the future for me depending on how it functions on wet surfaces.

1iz8ewn,RunningShoeGeeks,Norda 001 - First Run,"https://imgur.com/a/5D7wrQA

Personal Context: M, 130lb, 5'9. Trail runs/hikes range from 15-40km with at least 500m elevation gain/loss, mostly in forested and alpine terrain with some class 2-3 scrambling. My other trail shoe is the Bushido II (reserved for technical mountain scrambles/approaches), and my current road shoes are the Magnify Nitro 2, Zoom Fly 6, and the MS Sky Paris.

I average 60-70km/week on the roads split between one daily trainer and one workout shoe, meaning I go through 4-5 pairs of road shoes a year. After reading about the durability of norda shoes, I purchased the 001s in an effort to curb spending. I plan to use the 001s for both trail running and hiking, so if they could last 1000+ miles like people claim then the cost per km would be quite efficient even if the upfront cost was high. Also, buy Canadian or something I guess.

I'm an US M8.5/W10 in running shoes, so I got my 001s in US9. The fit was perfect, even with thicker hiking socks. The heel seems to be an issue at the beginning for most people, but with the thicker socks it wasn't a problem at all. I've also seen people flip the heel tab down between heel and shoe which seemed to provide enough protection. The eTPU insole is a nice touch.

My initial run was 20km with 800m elevation gain/loss, total activity time 2.5hrs. I ran on asphalt, gravel, dirt, mud, and brush. It was mostly flat with two steep uphills and downhills. There were also a few moments of class 2 scrambling on wet/mossy rock.

I picked the harder route whenever I could on this run, and 001s handled everything I threw at it perfectly. The Litebase sole had excellent traction on all surfaces and I never felt even a hint of a slip; I zoomed through the downhills with full confidence. Mud and debris never really clung to the lugs either. Ankle lockdown was perfect with a runner's knot. I'm not sure how water resistant the Dyneema upper is supposed to be, but I sank the shoes deep into mud and puddles multiple times and my socks remained dry. My extremities run extremely cold during exercise so upper breathability/warmth is never an issue for me except during peak summertime. Although my legs were cooked after the run, my feet felt really good. Being a trail shoe the 001s aren't particularly plush or responsive, but nevertheless the running was stable and comfortable. I'd use them in all four seasons for anything less technical than class 3-4 scrambling.

In terms of durability, there was not a single nick or scratch on any part of the shoe after the run. The upper doesn't seem to wash easily; after 20 minutes of scrubbing with a brush and soap it seems that the toebox area will be permanently dirt dyed. Thankfully it matches the colorway, but if you're concerned about aesthetics I'd stay away from the lighter colors.",2025-02-27 05:19:57+00:00,24,17
1iz2lqv,RunningShoeGeeks,"First Day, First Run with AP4. Sending Them Back.","Based upon the rave reviews on here, I bought the AP4 from Adidas. I found them at Dick's in Euless, TX (DFW Metro) and tried them on. On me, they were TTS (12). The only color that they had at Dick's was white, which is a hard pass from me, so I ordered a pair of the yellow ones from [Adidas](http://Adidas.com) after reading about their return policy.

I've been having an issue on the ball of my left forefoot wherein my Saucony ES4s are causing pressure points and fore/aft callouses in the middle . I had assumed that the super squishy AP4 might help. I received my AP4 today and quickly took them for a four mile run. Initially, the ""wow"" factor was present. These shoes are fast and comfortable. At around the two-mile mark, the pressure issue on my left foot reared its ugly head yet again, right above the carbon rods. It was especially bad and I immediately realized that these shoes aren't for me. The next and similarly disappointing issue is the heel counter absolutely destroyed my achilles on both feet. I've got raw spots where they wore a holes in my epidermis. Continuing the run was incredibly painful.

I'm extremely disappointed with these shoes. They are crazy fast, but will not work for me. I have already ordered the yellow Evo SL to replace them. I have owned both the Saucony EP3 and EP4. The EP4 suits me better than the three, but they don't hold a candle to the AP4. These Adidas shoes are next-level. The foam is out of this world. The energy return and bounce were incredible. I sincerely hope that the Evo SL is the ticket to solving all of my issues.

Me: 6'2"" 201 lbs. I'm not fast but can move out when I need to. I'm also old at 47. The AP4 didn't seem to be phased by my weight, and was stable enough that I wasn't worried about injury. I can see why many love them, unfortunately I'm not able to partake in the festivities.",2025-02-27 00:16:32+00:00,0,23

1iz0hqr,RunningShoeGeeks,Nike Pegasus Trail 5 after 160km / 100 miles,"**Profile:** Late 30s, 193cm, 82kg (6'3"", 181lbs). Very wide forefoot, neutral mid-heel striker. Just run to keep fit, not race.

**Types of run in these shoes:** Mainly easy runs at around 6min/km (9:40min/mi), and sometimes push a bit faster in a Parkrun, but have other shoes for speedier road stuff (NB5, VF3). 

**Terrain:** 40% of the time on road only, 55% on mixed road/light trail, 5% on pure technical trails (e.g. in mountains). 

**Pros:**

* **Great fit:** Secure in the mid foot, wide enough toe box.
* **VERY comfortable ReactX midsole**: I feel like I can run forever at easy pace without my feet feeling fatigued. Soft and squishy feeling especially under the heel, but also stable enough.
* **Tread pattern fine for pure road running**: They can probably be used for 100% road no problem (although not ideal).
* **Outsole grip and durability:** Grip is much better than previous Nike trial grip, haven't slipped on damp rock/roots like I used to in previous Nike trail shoes (Kiger 8 was abysmal). Also seems very durable considering how much I've used this, still lots of rubber left. 
* **Multiple uses:** Great for general walking around/hiking too, i.e. a good vacation/holiday shoe. I've probably done tons of extra distance just walking around cities. The heel tread has worn down a lot probably due to walking a lot.
* **Price:** Can usually be found on sale for a very good price. I just picked up a second pair for £62.99 that I plan to use for my first marathon later this year that's road/trail mix and a lot of elevation.

**Cons:**

* **Energy return:** Not the best for running fast, as seems to take a bit more effort. I can comfortably run faster in Asics Novablast 5 for example. Probably due to the outsole rubber and foam softness in these.
* **Technical trails:** Midsole a bit too soft and not enough rubber coverage/protection for really rocky terrain. The midsole can twist a bit too much underfoot if there's uneven/spiky rocks
* **Break-in:** Took a couple of runs to break-in the upper and get the fit right. First run felt too tight along the mid foot and loose in the heal initially.

1iyo82u,RunningShoeGeeks,ON Cloudsufer 2 : from a Mach 56 and Novablast 5 owner's perspective,"I (M33) am training in the city during the week for two 50km trail races this spring/summer.

My shoe rotation consists of:

* A comfortable everyday shoe, previously the Mach 5 (920km, which I loved) and now a pair of Novablast 5 (190km), which is growing on me more and more.
* A light, low-to-the-ground, and dynamic race shoe for intensity and interval running: the Kiprun KD800 Light, recently replaced by the KD 900 LIGHT.

I had the opportunity to try the new CS 2 during a running event held by my training group. It was a 9km run at 5:00 to 5:15 min/km.

We tried the CS1 last year in the same setup and found it way too mushy. The ride of the CS2, however, couldn’t be more different!

It’s definitely firmer on impact, but it doesn’t give much energy back. It feels like an expensive damper setup with cheap springs: it absorbs pavement irregularities all at once, making your feet feel level at all times—but that’s about it. You’re shielded from the road, but you don’t get any feedback or road feel. It’s quite a weird sensation, honestly.

In the end, the ride is a bit uninspiring. The Novablast 5, by comparison, has a more springy feel, giving back some energy on each stride, with more road feel.

The CS2 is still a well-padded shoe like the previous version, and it feels light. I’d say the fit is similar to my Mach 5 (non-wide), true to size with enough space in the toe box. The lacing is great, and lockdown is easy.

But overall, this shoe is puzzling to me:

* We all agreed it lacks comfort and cushioning to be a true recovery or long-run shoe. I think it could get tiring at an easier pace beyond 1h15/1h30 of running.
* It’s not responsive enough for intervals, and I wouldn’t choose it for a half-marathon race (I’m an average 1h38–1h42 runner), whereas the Mach 5 was an ideal shoe for that distance and my level.

In conclusion, I think it’s an ideal walking/travel shoe—since you need support but not too much cushioning—but not a great running shoe. I definitely prefer the Mach 5 and the Novablast.",2025-02-26 14:03:33+00:00,27,21

1iy8nmb,RunningShoeGeeks,Alphafly 3 Shoe Review,"
Background: 35F, 120 lbs. Full marathon- 3:51, half 1:52. Long time runner, just starting to dip my toes into the shoe game. Brooks Adrenlines have always been my everyday trainers, and while I did try the Hyperion Max 2s last year, I just got the Alphafly 3s and it’s a game changer. So far I’ve just run a tempo 10k in them, but I’m looking forward to some 400s on the track soon.

They fit true to size, women’s 6. The upper is very comfortable, all mesh and also see through so you can play with the colorway depending on the socks. The toe box is roomy, plenty of space for the bunions, not too much pressure anywhere. Feels great overall, snug but not squeezing. I didn’t notice any slippage in the heel on this first run out. Laces felt nice and grippy. It’s tight getting them on, but there is a nice strap on the back heel that makes them super easy to slide on. 

This shoe is so light! Especially compared to my adrenalines. These are only 5.72 ounces. These little clouds are super springy and soft. There’s a bunch of foam, feels like a lot tbh. Walking around in them felt sort of like being on a boat. Don’t think I’d want to do much else in them other than run. The stack is high; I almost felt like I was in a platform shoe. The bounce though … amazinggggg. This carbon plate does not play around. I could definitely feel it working my calves more than normal, and the difference in my stride was remarkable. At 47:27, the 10k in the alphaflys was a full 4 minutes faster than my last 10k and only 2 minutes off my PR with a LOT less effort. The run felt so good, easy breezy, and I could really feel the spring in my stride. Although I can’t wait to try them on the road, the treadmill felt too short in these puppies. I was surprised how much bounce they gave considering how soft the foam feels. The arch felt pretty neutral. The heel stack seems so tall, it 38.1 mm, but it didn’t effect the run imo. The AirPods are great, felt like I was flying up with every step. 

These shoes feel so much more effective than the Hyperions which are the only race shoe I have to compare to so far. The spring action from the plate and the pods is noticeable but I still felt I was running my regular stride. Just faster, lighter, and longer. At $285, it’s somewhat difficult to rationalize them, but I’m definitely thinking they will help me reach another PR on my next marathon. Guess the value for me will depend on how many miles I am able to get out of them. Overall I’m hooked and think I’ve unfortunately found another money pit.

1ixwfo3,RunningShoeGeeks,Nike Vomero 18,"Sizing: TTS.

I think we all know Nike has mostly only been good with their race shoes the last few years. However, the Zoom Fly 6 being a banger has given me hope that things are turning around with their other offerings. I walked into my local store a couple days ago and was surprised to see they had these in stock about a week early. Trying them on, they really felt great so I was out $150(great job by Nike to lower the price from the 17).

Upper wise, these are very plush, and wider than usual for a typical Nike fit. I think it will be accommodating for more than the usual runners that pick Nike. It’s not the most breathable upper and could be quite hot in summer but that’s the tradeoff for all this padding.

Midsole is the star of the show. It’s 46mm of stack, and this feels like a max stack shoe for the first time. The Vomero 17 was a nice cruiser but feels almost minimalist compared to this. The midsole feels like it is about half ZoomX with a ReactX base for stability and durability. The ride is lovely, smooth, comfortable, and helps you to not notice the weight as much. There is a really nice rocker geometry up front that keeps it rolling along. Speaking of weight, it is competitive with the Glycerin Max and Bondi 9, both of which it is in a similar class to. These are cruisers, not meant for speed but comfort, and they deliver that in spades.

Outsole is very tacky, and actually has some nice flex grooves to give the midsole some flex despite such a high stack. I really think this is a great option for recovery days or long easy runs, especially undercutting Hoka by $20 on the Bondi 9 or Brooks by $50 on the Glycerin Max.

1ixqhc6,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Bondi 9 thoughts at 100km,"Hoka Bondi 9 thoughts at 100km

M 6ft2 85kg HM 1:27 Mar: 3:09 
Shoes in rotation, Adios Prob3, Hoka Cielo x1, Saucony speed 4, Hoka Mach 6, Puma Magmax 

As titled suggests just crossed over the 100km mark in the Bondi 9s. 
Reason I picked them up was I’ve had a lot of success with the Mach 6 and Cielo so thought would give these a go as a easy day/recovery shoe with the potential for an ultra shoe (definitely won’t be this though). 

Mainly used for recovery runs which are around 10-12km at 5:45 (min per km) pace. 

Fit: went true to size with no issues. If anything would say they maybe ever so slightly short but wasn’t an issue so would stick to your normal Hoka size. Very comfortable upper and very plush. One thing to note is I have a slightly flatter foot and can feel a bit of pressure on the side of my arch when I run. Hasn’t cause any issues but just putting it out there. 

Ride and review: so the ride is actually quite a bit firmer than I expected. I saw somewhere that they using a similar midsole compound to the Mach 6 (unsure if that is accurate) but would say they very different feelings. Where the Mach is soft with a bouncy feeling and energy return I find the Bondi just a little flat and doesn’t give you a whole lot back. 
This lack of bounce with a firmer feeling just leaves me a little unsure of what Hoka is trying to do with the shoe. From what I am looking for it just feels to firm for recovery but just not enough push/energy return for anything else. 
It’s almost like Hoka have tried to go one of two ways, they tried to make a big bouncy shoe and which rivals the superblast (but they have this in their rotation anyway so doubt it was this) which I would say have missed the mark or they have focused specifically on a good walking shoe, which I think it could work well for. 

In summary it’s fine, I personally wouldn’t pick it again. Even just looking in Hoka’s line up I think the Clifton would be a better option, and believe is both lighter and cheaper. I just struggle to see how and where the shoe fits into the Hoka line up. 

A side note not related to the performance. I first started to see Hoka when they became the like “fashion” running shoe. Specifically like bold, fun colours and really stood out. But recently it seems like they’ve left their creativity at home. All the colours just look bland and boring. Im sure there a lot of people who think the opposite to me but would be nice to see Hoka return to that fun side of the brand. 

I’ll continue to use them as a recovery shoe just to get some use out of them but won’t be used for much else. A pity as think it’s a miss from Hoka (for me personally). 
Happy to answer any questions.

1ixnibl,RunningShoeGeeks,Adidas Adizero EVO SL at 55 miles and post marathon,"58 year-old mid/forefoot striker at 5’8”, 150 lbs. I size up to 9 1/2 to save toenails lost wearing size 9 for many years, even thought they fit. Current shoe rotation: Asics Novablast 5 daily/long/recovery, Adidas EVO SL daily/long, EVO SL and Asics Magic Speed 4 intervals, EVO SL and Saucony Kinvara 14 speed/hills, EVO SL and Endorphin Pro 3 marathon. Asics Metaspeed Edge Paris: still trying to find out what this shoe is going to be good for. Apple Watch Ultra 2 with the Apple Fitness keep track of things. Easy 9-10/mi, 7-7:15 5K, 7:30 10K, 8:15-8:30 half, 10 marathons ranging from a 3:27:16 BQ to over 4:30.

This was my 10th marathon and first in the Adidas EVO SL's. I have raved about these shoes in my two previous posts before this run, and they did not disappoint going the distance. I'm really having a hard time finding anything negative to say about this shoe as it really checks all of the boxes:

* Lightstrike Pro foam felt as firmly soft crossing the finish line as it did at the start.
* Lightweight.
* Excellent energy return for a non-plated shoe.
* Responsive and wants to go fast.
* Great toe off/smooth transition due to the aggressive rocker. Late in the race when I was tiring and my form was breaking down, I leaned forward and the shoe helped push me along.
* Upper breathes extremely well, and I have changed my tune to consider it very supportive now that I've broken them in. The race temp at the start was around 41 degrees and 50ish at the end. With Feetures merino wool socks, my feet were cool and comfortable and did not break a sweat the whole race.
* Fit has become more adapted to my feet. Ok, well, how about not as loose after the break-in phase, which for me was around 20 miles.
* The toe box area is roomy and I never felt any pressure on the sides of my feet or toes, hence why I go up in size.
* They were the best looking shoes out there......with the exception of the Adios Pro 4 wearers sporting the same Lucid Lemon colorway!

Okay, I guess I have to have one non-positive thing to say and that is they don't have the over-the-top energy return/propulsion/spring of a plated shoe like the Endorphin 3's or Metaspeed Edge Paris, but they aren't supposed to! Oh, one more thing: due to the narrow heel, I still would not recommend these for heel strikers or someone looking for a stability shoe. Nothing negative, but this is not a max cushioned shoe. However, at my stature, I don't need it, so the Novablast 5's would be my recommendation for a more cushioned shoe with really good energy return. (Edit: the laces suck, so double knot them and you will be fine. Enough said.)

Bottom line is that this shoe is a do-it-all shoe for me. My revised shoe rotation has the EVO SL in all categories except for recovery as I feel it's that good of a shoe. My legs were toast after the race, (which I attribute mostly to age and lack of strength training on my part.....and running 26.2 miles!), but not my feet for the first time ever after a full distance.  I would highly recommend for someone that wants a great marathon shoe but doesn't like plated shoes.

1iwxncz,RunningShoeGeeks,Adidas Adizero Adios 8 Review,"mileage: 300km
purchased for 60USD (srp is 120USD)

Fit/upper: I usually wear an 8.5-9 US men’s and have a wide midfoot, standard heel, and slightly wide forefoot. I read that these had an accommodating fit especially in the midfoot, was able to fit in store an 8.5 US was perfect. Nice and wide both in the midfoot and forefoot. Like the rest of the Adizero shoes of this generation, it uses a plasticy mesh material for the upper which is a bit stiff but very breathable. It has some padding in the heal but minimal, which is fine for me. It also features a simple standard lacing setup, unlike the Adios Pro 3, which helps it be easy to lace and quite adjustable in terms of fit. As with most Adidas shoes the laces are pretty thin and can be a bit harsh especially since the tongue doesn’t have much padding either. Had a few runs where I had to stop and relace which is a bit annoying. I also found the seem at the back of the heel to be quite harsh and occasionally have issues on my left foot if I use thin socks and tie the laces a bit too tight. 

Midsole/Ride: I read a lot of good things about the shoe and the foams it uses, Lightstrike and Lightstrike Pro being bouncy, responsive, and durable. From the first run up to my recent runs it has lived up to those descriptions. Pleasantly surprised how versatile it is considering how low stack the shoe is and how it is marketed and how some people strongly dislike it. I started out using it only for tempo or faster interval sessions which it shines in, it feels fast and responsive but also flexible. I personally really like how you can feel how your feet interact with the ground and everything you put in you get out, never felt like it was too soft and dampening any force I put in especially on strides and short reps. 

I began using them on more runs, daily easier short runs and really like how they feel for all paces. I came from a football background and it felt like running on a well maintained artificial grass field, nice and direct with a bit of bounce. I’ve taken it up to 17km and it felt pretty good the whole time, legs were a bit sore the next day but nothing too drastic. It might help that I’m a small as well, around 60kg so maybe heavier runs might run into an issue of bottoming out the foam. I also have a midfoot strike so I’m mostly landing on the Lightstrike Pro foam but also on the plastic(?) torsion bar though I never felt it an issue. 🤷 I also find it nice to walk in because it isn’t too soft, doesn’t have an aggressive rocker, and is flexible. I’ve attended a work event in them where I was on my feet for 8 hours and had no issues at all. 

TLDR: In the age of stack heights getting higher and foams getting softer, the Adios 8 (and likely the 9) offer a breath of fresh air (or blast from the past) that goes beyond just very fast sessions and I think is a very valuable type of shoe to have for most runners. Even at SRP, I think it provides great value with how versatile and likely durable (foam and upper) it is. 

It also serves as a great vacation/holiday shoe since it is so versatile, light and easy to pack. It helps that it feels good to walk in too with how flexible it is and doesn’t really have a rocker geometry. 

Hope to hear others’ thoughts on the Adios 8 and 9, I know a lot of people aren’t a fan of it as well because it is so different from the rest of the shoes on the market. ",2025-02-24 08:51:35+00:00,120,57

1iweb20,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Cielo X1 2.0 (20 miles including Half Marathon) First Thoughts,"Background: M30 150 lbs, HM 1:35
Daily Trainers: Hoka Mach 6, Hoka Mach X



What I’ve done so far: 7 mile break-in run at 8:15 min/mile pace.  Half Marathon Race (PB).



Fit and Feel:  I’m wearing TTS and would say these are more spacious than typical super shoes.  The upper is very comfortable (material has a plastic-like texture).  The rocker is aggressive and foam has a fun bounce to it.  Forefoot platform is decent width, but heel is narrow and can be wobbly.  Stability feels fine while running for the most part.  I appreciated the heel collar being padded and structured rather than thin and wobbly like many other race day shoes.



Post-Race Thoughts: 

Positives: These are an absolute blast to run in.    They were very protective and I did not have any foot fatigue until the final two miles of the HM.  I cut 5 minutes off my PB so I am very pleased with their performance.  They kept me rolling along effortlessly.



Negatives: Disclaimer I do not strength train at all, they were beating up muscles that I would normally never feel during a run.  There was a little foot sliding going on, but after locking the laces down tighter it was resolved.  Running downhill felt uncontrollable.



I think the Cielo X1 2.0 is a super shoe for those prioritizing fun and comfort during races, rather than pure speed or stability.",2025-02-23 16:43:15+00:00,134,22

1ivmljb,RunningShoeGeeks,Craft CTM Ultra 3 - 10 mile first run,"I realize that the Craft CTM Ultra 3 is now an older shoe, but I don't see a ton of reviews for it on here, so I'll add my initial thoughts, especially with it being available at steep discounts (I picked it up for $60 and it is still available at that price). I had wanted to try Craft, was updating my rotation, and thought this sounded like an interesting proposition for longer, faster efforts. It's also the only shoe I have that is suitable for mixed road/light trail work.     

**The fit**
I found that it fit my foot quite well. I have rather high volume feet, so that's one of the things that made me want to try this shoe. I found it TTS (M11.5 for me), but very voluminous, especially in terms of height. I have tall insteps, so that worked well for me, but I found I still had to use a runner's knot and stopped at 3 miles to cinch the laces down for a better fit. Once that was dialed in, I had a mostly great ride, but towards the end of the run it felt like the laces had loosened a bit and I felt some of the sloppiness (esp in heel grip) that others have mentioned. 


**The feel**
At first, these felt remarkably stiff. I grew up wearing wood soled clogs. Between the firmness of the foam and the stiffness of the shoe, that was my first impression. They weren't uncomfortable at all. Just fully firm. I deliberately had my Garmin on a fave that just shows HR so I could take my first run by feel. For the first mile, they seemed a bit heavy and clunky and I figured I was kind of lumbering along. I was really surprised when I finished my first mile and got the announcement that I was pretty much bang-on the pace I normally carry in my Rebel v4 with that HR. Definitely a different ride, but apparently quite an efficient one. 

As I got to the 5ish mile mark, these switched from feeling like a wood board underfoot to a very, very, very firm memory foam mattress. That is, it felt like they sunk in ever so slightly at the contact points and barely rebounded. 

While stiff, they were never uncomfortable. Just very far from plush. 

**The run**
I took them on a 10 miler out of the box. I started with 4 miles at easy, zone 2 pace. It worked well. They were faster than I expected for the effort I felt I was putting in, which is the good news. On the other hand, I felt like I was running slower than I actually was. Not sure what to make of that. Needless to say (since it's not their intended use) I wouldn't use these for any kind of recovery or shorter, slow effort. They don't feel especially forgiving on your feet with that stiffness.   

I happened to pass by an asphalt track at mile 4, so hopped on and threw in 4x200 meter sprints. They picked up the pace really well. The foam doesn't have an energetic rebounding effect that feels like it's springing you forward with energy return. But the outsole makes great contact and grip that makes it feel like you're getting a lot of push off the ground. They turn over pretty well, and landing more on the forefoot during sprints also worked well. Again, not a shoe intended for Speedwork, but they held up well for it! 

After the track I did another 1-2 miles of easier effort to let my HR settle before finishing 2 miles of tempo running, getting up pretty much to HM pace. This was probably my favorite part of the run. They felt really great and surprisingly some of their weight/heft disappeared when picking up the pace. Again, the foam felt relatively flat in terms of rebound and all that, but the pace and effort kind of speaks for itself. 

**Conclusion**
Its only one run, but I took it through its paces in terms of efforts. It did its best, I think, at moderate to faster sustained pace efforts. It's probably best as a shoe for medium-to-long runs with some tempo work thrown in and one that can absolutely handle getting into some dirt/gravel. That also should help with the stiff feel underfoot. The ride doesn't seem as ""fun"" as other modern shoes, given all of that stiffness. But I was having a blast out there because I was able to pick up the pace and not struggle. I'm hoping the foam breaks in and soften more; if it does, this will be a joy. If it stays as stiff as it is now, I would probably top out training runs around HM (or slightly longer) distances. After my 10 miles, my feet had some soreness, which I would attribute to the shoes lacking some give. 

At $60, this is an easy shoe to recommend, especially if you're looking for something versatile with a bit more of an old school feel. I don't have specific models to compare to, so that ""old school"" feel in a pretty stable platformed, firm shoe is the best I've got.

1ivgwsy,RunningShoeGeeks,Nike Streakfly 2 First Run Impressions,"Having run in the streakfly 1, I was hooked on running with fast low stack shoes for shorter distance runs (\~5k or less). I was in Japan late last year when Adidas launched the Adios 9, but I decided to hold out and wait for the streakfly 2 after seeing rumoured pictures of it.

These were released silently online in Singapore a few days back. I was reminded of their release from a post on this sub and I went to check my Nike app. Most sizes (including mine) were sold out, but I continued to check on it and there was eventually stock for a US8 pair (more on sizing below).

[Side profile: note the drop](https://preview.redd.it/5ztmes32boke1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfb8a63fef1ab8bcd9162e8d864287cc3b5f054e)

**Sizing**

I usually wear a EUR42 for Nike running shoes, but I regularly find them slightly roomy (e.g., VF3). Due to the limited sizing available, I could only snag a EUR41. Fortunately, it fit well, albeit more like a glove. But given that I would probably use the SF2 for shorter, faster runs, it might be a good thing to have a racier fit. The toebox curves inwards quite sharply, so I think going TTS should be ok for most.

**Upper/Fit**

[Close up on the upper](https://preview.redd.it/fztv00uqboke1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a2ebaefa6c1f790eda692c82f82e98f1b751bff)

The upper is very breathable and lightweight. The fabric does not stretch. However, the laces are attached to the upper with a string-like thing (see picture 3 below), so there is some stretch overall. Again, I think it works well because you can cinch the laces down and give your feet some limited freedom in the upper. The laces are not the typical serrated ones seen on shoes like the VF3.

[Close-up on the lacing system](https://preview.redd.it/hwogdld9coke1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fa6eb490fedc0a8b94f22275f3885fd790294771)

**Midsole**

Make no mistake: Although the SF2 is marketed as having a 4mm drop, it does feel like a shoe with a negative drop when worn. At least on the insole for the proto colourway, there are two crosshairs. I suspect that they represent where the forefoot and heel are measured for stack height.

[\\""Crosshairs\\"" in the right shoe](https://preview.redd.it/xf3jp2pxcoke1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cac69b92da2c7e4d1edf2f53ae86c2d48caa1b9d)

As the forefoot crosshair is further forward of the shoe, it is ahead of the thickest part of the forefoot stack. I think this is why the shoe is measured to have a 4mm drop even though it looks to have a negative stack from the side profile (see picture 1).

Another interesting thing to note is that the midsole seems to not be fully ZoomX. The foam below the plate from the heel to behind the forefoot feels significantly firmer than the foam above. The way the ZoomX and the alternate foam are set up seems to mirror that from the Pegasus Premium, where all the foam under the forefoot is ZoomX and the outsole and the alternate foam only begin further back and continue to the heel.

**Outsole**

[Outsole of the SF2 after one run](https://preview.redd.it/yhohq825eoke1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=76739150ca08b529dac7a7298039333b116b143f)

Given that the shoe is designed purely for landing mid/forefoot, the outsole is only present primarily near the front of the shoe. The grip seems like the typical waffle-inspired pattern and works well, although I have not yet tried it on very wet pavement. As long as the footstrike is correct for the shoe, I don't think the exposed ZoomX would be at any significant risk of damage.

**Ride**

For my first run in the SF2, I did a few 1-minute interval reps. I immediately felt the ""negative"" drop and walking in it did feel weird. Once I started running, I could feel the shoe forcing me to strike towards the front of my feet. I think striking towards the back-mid or rear foot simply does not work with this shoe.

After I got up to pace for my intervals, these felt light, quick and nimble. Given the force applied to the forefoot during footstrike, the foam never felt too soft and provided great resilience together with the plate. I was near my top-end speed and never once felt that the shoe was limiting me.

**Conclusion**

I think the SF2 is perfect for shorter and faster-paced runs. It does a good job of keeping your footstrike towards the front as you will easily feel if you're not doing it. For well-trained runners, I think it can be used for 10k and up, but I will probably pick the VF for those distances. For someone who strikes mid-rear to rear but still looking for a quick race shoe, other shoes like the Adios 9 will probably serve you better. As for myself, I will use these for interval sessions for both road and track.

1iv1lal,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Cielo X1 2.0 - First Run,"Hoka Cielo X1 2.0 - First Run

I'm not really a fan of first run reviews, but thought this might be helpful for people with upcoming races or who loved the first version of this shoe.

My first run consisted of a quick warmup straight into 9 miles at marathon effort. The Cielo X1 2.0 met my sky high expectations and I wanted to offer some early feedback compared to the first version.

I'll start off by saying the Cielo X1 is my favorite shoe of all time. I ran my marathon PR (2:49) and posted a review about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/comments/1c1pqwu/hoka_cielo_x1_marathon_review/). Suffice to say, I was really looking forward to this update and so far, it has not disappointed. As other early reviews have said, they really did fix the biggest issues with the first version.

* The weight: it's almost 1.5oz lighter than the first version in my size (men's 10.5US), coming in at 8.1oz/229g. For reference, it's now basically the same weight as the Alphafly 3 in my size.
* The upper/fit: The upper material the biggest reason for the decrease in weight and much more in line with other racing shoes. It's still one of the most supportive uppers in a race shoe out there, but it's much more race-like than the original version. The fit is much more snug than the first version and fit my medium-narrow width foot perfectly. The lockdown is also now one of the best out there (up there with Puma for me). I had no issues and didn't have to retie my shoes after my warmup to get a better lockdown, which I pretty commonly have to do with other race shoes.
* The laces: I know the fixed this on later colorways of the first version, but just wanted to point out that it's also fixed in the new version. The laces good, but not anything to write home about.

Some other differences from the first version, good and bad:

* The rocker is even more aggressive, especially the heel bevel. It actually feels like it has a zero or even negative drop upon step in. However, on the run it feels completely natural and perfect for mid to forefoot striking, especially at faster paces. My hot take is that this is the shoe that the Mizuno Wave Rebellion Pro is trying to be.
* The foam feels even bouncier.
* It's a little less stable. Others have already mentioned this or guessed based on the pictures, but they moved the midsole cutout to the medial side and also decreased the width in the heel and midfoot. It's a little noticeable at slower paces, but goes away at faster paces. I still wouldn't call it *unstable* and would consider it as the average high stacked racing shoe, it's just that the first version was more stable than average IMO.

Overall, my first impressions are fantastic. I'm currently training for a marathon and this is easily my top choice. This is finally a racing shoe where I don't question if there are better options out there. However, like others out there, I will miss the first version as the ultimate marathon training shoe, but my hunch (or hope) is that they move the Mach X or Skyward X more in that direction.",2025-02-21 21:01:24+00:00,161,50

1iuom7p,RunningShoeGeeks,Asics Superblast Review (650km),"mileage: 650km
purchased them at 140USD second hand online, the seller said they were only used for 5km on a treadmill and looked and felt accurate. (Print on the insoles were intact and still had the brand new smell haha)

Fit: Some context, I usually wear an 8.5 or 9 US men’s and have slightly wide midfoot, some shoes that I’ve tried and can’t wear are the Adidas Boston 12 and various Puma nitro shoes. 
I got the Superblast in a size 9 US and around 1 cm space at the front and enough forefoot space that I can splay my toes. I could have gone with an 8.5 but wanted to play it safe especially since I was mainly looking to use these for longer runs. I use a runner’s loop for extra lock down but not really needed. I would recommend true to size for normal to wider feet, for narrow feet I can imagine going down have a size would work since they are a tad long anyway. A simple upper that provides great lockdown and just the right amount of padding in the heel. I tend to run hot so I would have liked the upper to be a bit more breathable, like the Metaspeed, and that would have brought the weight down further.

Ride/midsole: I have read that it takes around 50km for the midsole to break in and soften up and I did feel a bit of a difference around that mileage, I didn’t find them as firm as others have said when out of the box. The ride has a nice bounce and response, what you would expect from a supercritical race foam. I haven’t tried the Metaspeed series but I’d say comparable to Adidas’ Lightstrike pro that doesn’t really have a sinking feeling which I prefer. It did feel a bit awkward at the start considering how much stack there is but didn’t take long to get used to it, the wide base keeps it really stable at all paces. I found it really versatile and felt great from easy runs to speed sessions with the exception of really fast and short intervals but even then it’s usable. I’ve taken the shoes up to my longest ever runs (27km) and raced my first half marathon in them without any issues from the shoes; nice, fast, and stable. If I had to do a race tomorrow that’s 21k and could choose any shoe a new part of Superblast would be one of my top picks, might not be as fast and propulsive as dedicated race shoes but the stable base while being light is a good trade off for someone like me who isn’t looking to podium haha 🤷

Durability: Up until 500km or so I didn’t notice much change in the midsole, it got a bit softer over time but always had enough pop when pushing harder for longer sessions. I also really liked how I felt pretty fresh after long runs or workouts in them, making them hard not to choose for most runs. The outsole wasn’t great but it wasn’t that bad even when slighlty damp, didn’t show much wear. Currently some parts of the outsole and oddly enough parts of the exposed foam are shaken down. On one of my shoes, the inside corner of the exposed foam seems to have been shaven at an angle. Not so sure what that means about my running form 🤔

While I wouldn’t pick these at their current mileage for any new races I will still wear them for most of my runs including longer sessions. Sometimes I feel my legs a bit more beat up after long sessions in these compared to when they were newer but not too bad considering how many Ks they’ve done. I can expect to keep running in them until 800km or even more. The durability might be helped that I’m fairly small and weigh 60kg.

Value: In my country they cost ___USD from Asics and were very hard to come by. At that price I wouldn’t have bought them. But at their usual srp and lower they would be a great purchase especially for those who want to keep their shoe rotation minimal. The durability helps justify the price too. 

TLDR: The Superblast is a great shoe that’s able to just about any run really well. With how light, stable, and accommodating it is they also can serve as race shoes for most people especially those who don’t want to spend a huge amount for a pair they can only use occasionally. To me, they live up to the hype. 

Haven’t tried the Superblast 2 but if I see a really good deal in my size I wouldn’t hesitate to snag a pair. I would be happy to answer any questions about the shoe, interested to hear how the SB2 compares for those who’ve had both. Also wonder how they feel racing a full marathon especially since they do not have a carbon plate.

1iu207j,RunningShoeGeeks,Initial Impressions of the ON Cloudmonster 2 (as a heavier runner): the *OTHER* heir to the Boston 12,"### a brief preview of the substance of this review: an idea relating the boston 12, evo SL, and on cloudmonster 2 that will recur a couple of times here:

[can you tell what shoe colorways i usually like?](https://imgur.com/rNtQKLG)

### brief disclamatory paragraph

i’m going to mostly talk about the ON Cloudmonster 2 in this review, but i have this short introductory disclaimatory paragraph because: i often feel like shoe reviews are us randos trying our best to sound like shoetubers, and can easily become the same 3-5 stock phrases repeated over & over; “firm & responsive ride,” “soft & pillowy cushioning,” “a big slab of lightstrike pro” (anyone else sick of hearing about the Evo SL? too bad it shows up here too). 

*anyway* — if we’re going to do something besides that, it needs to feature some transferability, the pedagogical idea that when you learn it shouldn’t just be task-specific, but should teach you something about how to approach novel tasks in the future. so i’m going to lay out why i picked the On Cloudmonster 2 as a shoe, but even if you *wouldn’t* wear the OCM (as i’ll abbreviate it here), hopefully this review could still be a worthwhile read by modeling the thought process that goes into filling gaps in the shoe rotation.

### my specifics, & identifying the gaps in the shoe rotation

re: me: i’m 5’9 & ~200 lbs, dense as all get out, and all these PRs are from just before the birth of my now 8-mo baby: 5k 20:30–something, HM 1:38:08. i got an upper-leg/groin tendon injury ~6 months ago, and so while i feel like i’m finally “back,” i definitely am only just now starting to focus on speed like i used to. 

re: my current rotation: i’ve been running in almost exclusively adidas shoes for a second now; this is due to a bunch of reasons specific to me, i don’t think they’d be best for everyone. but i: midfoot strike, have a wide metatarsal “pad,” but a narrow midfoot & heel, need space for toe splay, don’t need any pronation support at all, supinate mildly (so don’t get on too well with carbon plates, which don’t have enough lateral flexibility for me), prefer firm foams to soft foams, and *love* a good sale. to date, adidas has been the best shoe company at meeting all those criteria.

the Boston 12 (capitalized outta respect) was the first “real” running shoe i got — i went from some off-the-rack adidas shoe from nordstrom that i’m *quite* confident was not for running, to the NB SC Trainer v1, and after those went flat around ~230 miles in, wanted something *real* to replace them with. got the boston 12 right after it came out and i, like many heavy/dense/muscular runners, fell in love immediately. Lightstrike Pro is famously adored by heavier runners for its resilience & energy return, and i fell in love immediately.

that was ~1.5 years ago, and my shoe rotation has settled into: Adidas SL2 for everyday training, Evo SL for tempo/intervals/easy runs where i’m willing to go faster than i should; AP3/PXS models for 10+ mi runs (AP3 for any pace, PXS for tempo miles in the LR). boston 12 when i want to. this is a fantastic rotation; it has no *real* holes, and a lot of flexibility, and keeping things fresh is important in training to avoid some of the mental burnout.

### BUT!

… you’ll notice this rotation doesn’t really have any shoes you *can’t* go fast in. not all the shoes want to be *equally* fast, but they all still basically *will* if you ask them to. and if you have ADHD — heck, if you really at all struggle with impulse control sometimes (not 100% causally un-connected from the 200lb thing imo), then you know how hard it can be to feel amazing on a run and not give in and kick your run up faster than it should get. that’s not a problem if you’re just maintaining base milage — and, sitting between 25 and 35 mpw for the last few months, that’s been good enough. but as i look toward NYCM training, i’ll need a shoe that can genuinely do, and **only** do, easy day miles.

### past attempts, and the most recent attempt

initial criteria: looking for a shoe that doesn’t let me go fast

in the past i’ve tried to put the NB More v4, and the SC Trainer v2 in this position in my rotation; but after ~25/50 miles respectively i quit due to multiple points of friction. in both, i just hate the foam; it’s too soft & compressive, which makes me feel like i’m actively getting my energy sapped as i run. it forces me to run slow, sure, but it also makes me feel like i want to drop down to a walk; a demoralizing and joyless feeling. additionally, the base on the more v4 is **far** too wide for my preference; i like a narrower heel & midfoot, even for recovery. **takeaway: foam can’t be too soft.** additionally, the plate in the SCv2 and i don’t get along; this is where i first learned that i don’t like carbon plates for anything but fast running, because they don’t offer enough flexibility laterally. (still enjoy the Endorphin Pro 3, though, that’s a great fast-day shoe). **takeaway: no carbon plates, even if they’re not “for speed.”**

in the Great ShopSimon Sale of Early 2025 (GSSS25), i made out like a bandit with new AP3 and PXS2 (the latter for $100! insanity), but also picked up the Supernova Rise after hearing youtuber Sagasu Running emphasize all the qualities i wanted in a shoe in it: a cushioned PEBA foam that **doesn’t** encourage speed, protects the legs, and lets you forget about them. so during that sale i also got the SR (for like $60, it was great), hoping they’d fill that spot in the rotation. unfortunately, after 16 miles, i could easily determine they weren’t; i was consistently getting soreness in my quads and hamstrings when i ran past 4 miles in them, which doesn’t happen in other shoes (including the quite low-stack-by-modern-standards SL2).

at the end of the day, i’m heavy, and have dense bones, and i just think the 25 (!!) mm of stack in the forefoot was simply not enough cushioning for a heavy guy who lands midfoot. maybe if i was a heel-striker! womp womp. 

### evaluative criteria

it’s worth here taking a brief 2-3 sentence detour to mention the EVO SL, and how its position in my rotation isn’t what i’d hoped it’d be. i love that shoe a lot; but what i’d hoped for when it was announced was a shoe that was more cushioned than the boston 12 (due to full LSP), but without rods — and thus, would still “bounce” in the way i like as a big runner, but also be able to go slow instead. but the opposite is true; as a midfoot striker, the altered rocker has a dramatically more pronounced impact than the removal of the rods — and i consider the Evo SL to be a faster shoe than the Boston 12 by a wide margin. **takeaway: if i want a shoe i’m able to go slow in, the rocker’s going to need to be as minimal as possible.**

so if we stack all these takeaways into a list of specific criteria, it looks like:

- firm foam
- 30+ mm stack height (adidas SL2 is ~27 of mostly LSP, and i assume i need a bit more of a non-LSP foam for equal cushioning as an afore-frequently-mentioned heavy runner)
- minimal rocker, as close to flat on bottom as possible
- no carbon plate
- not too wide a base

from there, i started researching (with a lot of background knowledge, obvs) the favorite shoes of heavier runners. here’s approximately where i ended up:

DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE:
- all New Balance (including both mainline v13 and v14 models of 1080 and 880): i’m 0/2, that’s just a bad sign so far

DISMISSED BASED ON INFORMATION
- Puma MagMax/Glycerin Max/Superblast 2: disqualified for versatility. i owned the initial superblast, and loved it for easy running; but its ability to *also* go fast is a disqualifier here. i’m not looking for a versatile shoe. based on metaanalytical reviews (reading lots) of the former 2, that’s an issue there too. they’re probably good shoes; but they’re bad for fitting into this slot of my rotation.
- Saucony Triumph/Ride: reviews suggest i mayn’t like the foam of the triumph, but might of the ride; but both shoes feature saucony’s pronounced rocker, which i know both from owning the ES3/EP3, as well as the Evo SL, that a rocker + my strike means picking up the pace, which i *don’t* want.
- Asics Cumulus/Nimbus: dismissed due to accused similarities to the More v4; i do not want a soft, or pillowy, or “cushioned,” ride as traditionally described, because when you’re heavy enough it generates this grating “quicksand” effect. 

guys as you can see i was desperate. genuinely wondering if i just needed to go out and buy a pair of the Boston 11s, easily the worst-reviewed shoe i’ve seen since i’ve started following shoe reviews in jan 23, and if you look above at my criteria you can see the boston 11s don’t technically violate any of them. oh god.

### saved from the boston 11 at the last moment (aka here is where the review of the OCM begins in earnest):

the Cloudmonster 2 came up repeatedly as a shoe favored by heavier runners, but featuring a firmer ride. i have a baseline prejudice against ON — i consider their shoes to be a bad value for what you get out of them, and you can find better value elsewhere. given that i have kids, that’s important to me — that’s actually part of why adidas is so appealing, absolutely bananas sales.

but as i looked more into it, the cloudmonster was described as:

- heavy
- slower than equivalently-priced supertrainers
- firm
- unrockered
- no plate (“speedboard” to stabilize, but it brings no speed)

and, like — that’s what i’m looking for. found it for ~$135, and given i was able to flip my supernova rises for ~$40 locally, that’s like sub-100 for the shoe.

and at under $100 net, the OCM is solid at being that one thing. tried them on in-store, felt the firmness & lack of rocker, and immediately knew that even if some problems came up while running in them, that at least these were the *kind* of shoe i was looking for. i just needed to see if they worked.

### initial 8mi run

[they’re great.](https://imgur.com/c4mDlxD) as in, they’re great *for recovery runs*. everything i’m about to say is “good” about them are reasons why reviewers didn’t like them v. much when they first came out — they’re heavy, it’s challenging to pick up the pace, they don’t have either plate/rods or a rocker, so there’s **zero** pace encouragement, etc. but those are all reasons why i wanted them — and they did great. my HR was even a little higher than it should’ve been for that pace (~9:30-10:00/mi, 140 bpm is what i’d expect, ~146 bpm is what i got), but like, again, who cares; the *point* is i want it to just let me log miles without encouraging me to work hard, because “hard” there almost always means that mushy-middle of a 6/10 effort that tires you out without really developing your capacity at all. 

### elephant in the room — sizing (aka: you could literally fit an elephant in these shoes)

i often consider myself above the “sizing fray”. TTS, 1/2 up, 1/2 down; *seek god*. i am a 12 in all adidas shoes (but the TS9 was too narrow, and the PXS1 is a little long; PXS2 is perf). i am a 12 in the new balance shoes i’ve tried. i’m a 12 in all saucony shoes i’ve tried + put 200+ miles in. i’m a 12.

**you must size down by at least 1/2 a size in the OCM**. [linked is a photo of the adidas Evo SL — a notoriously baggy shoe that many people advise to size down 1/2 a size in — next to the OCM.](https://imgur.com/yLwzHeD) the evo SL is a 12, the OCM is an 11.5, and the fit on the two is **nearly identical**. i’ll do this quick comparison to other shoes i own:

11.5 OCM has **more** space than the:
- sz12 Adidas SL2, Boston 12, PXS2, AP3

11.5 OCM has **about the same** amount of space as:
- sz12 Adidas PXS2
- sz12 Adidas Supernova Rise (in the length; SNR is narrower)
- sz12 NB Mv4, SCv2

so yeah. the question on the OCM2 is not **if** you need to go down a 1/2 size; it’s **whether** you need a 1/2 size down or a whole size down. you gotta try this one on in-store. 

### the graph of what i think

[at the beginning of this — what can we call it, diatribe? screed? — i linked a graph, where the OCM and Evo SL are both equidistant on a continuum from the Boston 12, but on opposite sides.](https://imgur.com/rNtQKLG) there’s multiple ways in which i think this way of representing these 3 shoes’ relationship to each other is useful. check it:

**VALUE**: this one is obvious. the OCM is a terrible value at $180, and the Evo SL is ridiculous value at $150. and the B12 is, like, medium value at full cost, and exceptional value on sale. pretty straightforward.

**SPEED**: the B12 could feel confused about what kind of speed it wanted you to hold — is this an interval shoe? tempo? some heavier runners report enjoying **all** paces in it. but if the Evo SL is a distillation of the speed the B12 was capable of, the OCM feels just like the B12 on those random days where it seemed perfectly content to let you run slow. my problem there was that it was inconsistent; whereas i’m confident the OCM will continue to run slow on **all** future runs. 

**ROCKER**: the B12 has a mildly pronounced rocker. if the Evo SL made that rocker *more* aggressive, the OCM is far *less* aggressive in its rocker (visible when you put the two shoes against each other).

you know that episode of rick & morty where their toxic elements of their personalities get separated out from themselves? that’s how i think of the OCM and Evo SL in relation to each other; both feel like credible “children” of the Boston 12, but based on **radically** different elements of the original Boston 12 — a shoe that, I guess, contained multitudes. 

so i’d **strongly** recommend the ON Cloudmonster 2, but only in the following conditions:

- you only intend to use it for slow running
- you’re heavy enough for the firmness to not be punishing
- you’re okay w/ a heavy shoe
- you don’t expect it to compete with **any** supertrainers
- you can get it for “reasonable value” (whatever that means for you; i likely wouldn’t spend above $120 net on them)

and under those conditions, the OCM (IMO) has a strong position as a recovery day shoe for any runner who’s waiting for Adidas to introduce **some** kind of max-stack firmer runners into their lineup. who knows if it’ll come later this year — but for right now, the cloudmonster 2 can cut it.

1itof1j,RunningShoeGeeks,Brooks Hyperion Elite 4 PB Review after 70km,"Background: 127lbs, 168cm tall

After skipping on getting the original Hyperion Elite 4, I decided to pick this one up seeing that it finally had a midsole on par with other brands. After 70km, I can confidently say that this is absolutely a viable race day option.

I've run in this shoe anywhere from 1500m pace (69s/400m) to easy pace (4:40/km-5:10/km). I have used it mainly for workouts, but I've done a couple long runs in them. At the slower paces, the squishy foam is definitely very unstable, and I've nearly rolled my ankle a couple of times during runs, but that's not what the shoe is meant for. At all of the faster paces, I've been absolutely loving the shoe. Extremely snappy and responsive, with a good amount of softness under foot. I would've preferred a more agressive rocker on the shoe, but it still feels great for any faster sessions.

The upper that they kept from the original is legitimately the best race day upper I've ever tried. Extremely soft, lightweight, and breatheable. Not much more you can ask for. The tongue is minimal as it should be, although I wish it was gusseted. Heel lockdown is perfect, and with heel lock lacing, my ankle does not move around at all. The laces used are the proper laces for any race product, and anything else would have been disappointing.

There's a good amount of rubber on the outsole for a super shoe, so I think it will be one of the more durable options on the market. I've run on wet asphalt and tartan, as well as ice and snow. For wet surfaces the grip is fine, but as expected, the grip isn't great on ice and snow, like most shoes.

Overall, the Brooks Hyperion Elite 4PB is a superb option for race day, and Brooks finally has both excellent training and racing options. I think they would be a great option for racing anything from a road mile to a marathon, and I think they're durable enough to be used as a workout shoe.

The regular Mafate Speed 4 is my workhorse long run shoe. Used it for OCC and Javelina (DNF at 80 miles) last year.

I might pick up a pair for Canyons 100k later this spring. I hope the lighter upper might help with drying faster after some creek crossings.

**Total distance ran:**

138.56 miles (223km)

**Type of runs:**

I basically started fresh with running last July and my pace was 7'48/km, but tried to grow consistency up until now. Mostly easy runs and nothing too serious, ranging from 5 - 12km. I purchased the Novablast 5 on Boxing Day 2024.

Current BPs with the NB5:

\- 5'03/km for 5km

\- 5'31/km for 10km

\- 2-day fresh 5'42/km for half-marathon

**Weather ran in:**

Considering how white the shoes are I definitely went for dry days ehe, road runner and to be honest always had good weather here.

**My profile:**

171 cm (5.6 ft)

81 kg (178.5 lbs)

As far as I know, Mid to forefoot striker

Slight overpronation, but found out I can wear neutral shoes (ie, the NB5 lol).

Usually 20 - 30km a week depending on training load

**Positives (as my first pair of running shoes):**

* Lightweight especially for the amount of foam.
* I found it to have good breathability.
* No issue with grip, but then I only ran on dry road.
* Good lacing - never had my laces undone while running.
* It looks cool (duh)
* Definitely felt the 'trampoline' effect out of the box.
* Plush, very comfortable, bouncy, and not mushy.
* I like the rocker, feels natural and helps you step forward smoothly.
* They seem to hold wear quite well (at least the upper).
* Never got a blister with it.

**Negatives (as my first pair of running shoes):**

* Had new shoe adaptation for first few weeks: mild sore shins, sore calves and sore ankles.
* Personally took me a while to get used to the tongue (it feels short, but locks well).
* Compared to my previous shoes, they felt less stable due to the stack height and soft foam - but i got used to it.
* After 223km, the outsole is starting to wear out especially the middle part (see photos)
* After 223km, the foam has bottomed out a bit in the mid/forefoot area - the 'trampoline' effect is definitely very subtle now.
* After 223km, they feel more grounded than bouncy, and while it's not a bad thing, they have less 'pop'  in favour of comfort.

**Overview:**

They are my very first pair of proper running shoes, so I don't have the extensive knowledge that others may have here. However, as a new runner owning his first pair of running shoes, I absolutely enjoy the Novablast 5! It was an exciting journey to learn about running shoes, and especially feeling the comfort and discomfort that comes with the Novablast 5.

My previous shoes for running had mild and stiffer support, so it took me a while to get used to how plush and 'wobbly' the Novablasts were - all for the better as it strengthened my ankles and important muscles for running.

Out of the box, the NB5 feel amazing with so much plushiness, so much bounciness and you can feel the trampoline effect after every step. It was jarring at first as to how you can't 'feel the ground' with them escpecially when walking, but you get used to it.

They've served me equally well for short 5km runs or longer 12km runs. I am not familiar with speed work, intervals or threshold runs so can't really comment on those. They felt amazing for my first half-marathon as well, with absolutely no discomfort by the end of it, nor felt like I was being pulled back.

I find the upper very nice - my previous shoes always had a knit upper so it was always toasty. To be honest these are my most breathable shoes I've ever owned for now lol.

The outsole is the interesting part, especially after my mileage - I am not familar with how fast outsoles bottom out or wear off for typical running shoes, but it is now present on my pair. The feel is now more grounded, not necessarily as bouncy, but it retains the comfort. You can also see the grip starting to smooth out for me, especially in the middle area, and the bare foam section is also starting show wear. It does worry me about the lifespan of these running shoes (or running shoes in general!). To be fair i am also not the lightest (used to be 72kg, now 80kg) so this may be a factor for foam/grip lifespan.

Long story short - I wouldn't have chosen any other pair of shoes other than the NB5 as my very first pair of running shoes to start my journey. Within the first few weeks of owning them, I felt the excitement of running, broke BPs every other runs, and improved my fitness! By the time i knew, I ran my very first half-marathon in them and got a 2:00:44 time which I'm so proud of for my first halfie.

I would definitely buy them again once my current pair wear out, but would also love another pair in my rotation for more serious runs (any recommendations welcomed lol). While I love the plush and comfort they give, I think I would love to also feel a more grounded and 'poppy' pair of shoes for race day (SB2? Magic Speed 4? not too sure).

1irkfw5,RunningShoeGeeks,Really disappointed in Zoom Fly 6,"I may be in the minority, but I really wanted to love the Zoom Fly 6, seeing as being exactly the type of training show I like and use. I'm 5'11 152 mid-forefoot striker running 50-60 mpw.  

The positives of the shoe for me are:

* Feels lightweight on the foot even though it's 9 ounces in size 9.5
* Super comfortable upper and tongue with good fit. You can make the shoe fit as loosely of tightly as you want with no issues
* Nice cushioning across the shoe
* Shoelaces that stay tied
* Seems super durable

Negatives:

* Whatever the material is used for the outer sole protection feels rock hard. To me it really detracts from the ride of the shoe. I have about 50 miles on my pair, and those outer treads show zero wear with running variety of paces on pavement. Those outsoles just ruin it for me. If the ZF6 had an outsole like AP3 it might be totally different
* The plate...I've run too many miles to count in plated shoes of all types, and the plate in the ZF6 feels like it's made from steel. It just seems overly stiff and unyielding, even at faster paces (6 min per mile) and being a forefoot striker, I get no pop off the front compared to most other plated shows

At this point I'm just hoping that maybe the shoes will break in the plate and that harsh outsole. ",2025-02-17 13:59:31+00:00,69,93

1irf2q4,RunningShoeGeeks,361 Furious ET - 150km/100mi update,"First impressions post [link here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/comments/1hwl82h/comment/md5e97p/).

Now that I've spent a decent amount of time in these shoes, I think I've formed a solid idea of my opinion of this shoe.

Use - speed trainer / long interval shoe / social run  
steady to 5K pace.  
up to 1hr runs.

Midsole - 8/10 softness, 5/10 energy return.  
Definitely the biggest change in this shoe, has really softened up.  
Don't expect this shoe to give huge amounts of energy return like FF Blast Turbo in Metaspeeds or Lightstrike Pro in AP3s.  
It does help with running light-footed, but I don't think it's the same foam as used in the rest of the Furious line up because of the lack of energy return.  
I say lack of energy return, but it's more than what you'd get from any everyday trainer, just less than a CieloX1, which I originally thought this could be the little brother of. That died about 40km in.  
These feel like zero drop shoes when standing on heels now, that's how soft the foam has gotten.  
So keep in mind that if you're a heel-striker, you might feel like you need to get up & over your feet in these shoes because there really isn't much of a rocker before you get up on your toes.

Stability - very average, despite lower stack height.  
The super soft foam means that there isn't really much natural stability in this shoe, so I wouldn't recommend it for anything slower than steady pace days especially if you're a heel-striker and need some neutral ankle stability.

Fit - narrow across the toes.  
The shoe slightly squeezes across my forefoot knuckles and doesn't feel like I can even out the pressure by securing the midfoot or ankle with lacing.  
I don't have a particularly wide foot, with the Metaspeed Sky/Edge Paris being the perfect fit for my feet.  
The upper material doesn't really stretch or give, same as the Adios Pro 3, so it either works for you or it's not going to be ideal.  
FWIW I'm of Chinese descent and have the typical 'oriental' slightly 'roman' foot shape.  
I'm quite tempted to see if I can relax the fit in this region with a hairdryer.

Comfort - quite alright.  
The heel collar is almost over-ly padded.  
The upper doesn't have any hotspots like the AP3.

Durability - ETA 300mi/500km.  
I don't expect these to last much longer than that.  
Outsole shows a bit of wear, but haven't worn off anything more than half the surface detail near the toe-off where I normally rip through the quickest.  
I don't see anything falling apart, though I do have a small rip on the tongue gusset because my feet are fat and one of my toes got caught trying to jam myself into the shoe without loosening the laces properly.  
I'd be surprised if the foam stays constant like this after breaking in quite drastically.  
Will have to update again when 300km in.

Overall - no regrets, but wouldn't buy a second pair.  
Not the democratic AP3 that I was hoping for, more of an alternative speed trainer.  
Definitely keen on what next iterations and versions might feel like.

Comparisons  
Boston 12 - are more stable due to less compression in the heel, but feel a little bit slower (granted my pair are now 500km in) and clunky in the transition from heel to toe.

AP3 - are definitely faster, more propulsive with the racing toe-off, with the comfort trade-off.

EVO SL - are punchier and will roll through smoother, with about the same stability.

Rebel V4 - more stable in the heel due to width, also able to do slower recovery runs.

Cielo X1 (1.0) - is literally double this shoe in every way.  
Double the toe box.  
Double the stretch in the upper.  
Double the energy return.  
Double the fun.  
Double the price.

1iq9ky8,RunningShoeGeeks,Saucony Endorphin Pro 4 review after 250 miles,"**Total distance ran:**

250 miles (402 km)

**Type of runs:**

* 7-8 mile easy runs
* 10-12 mile steady runs 
* Threshold repeats
* 20-mile long runs

**My profile:**

Height: 6’0”

Weight: 160lbs

Weekly mileage: 70 miles (\~112km) 1:24 HM and 2:57 FM

Strike Type: Midfoot

**Overview:**

When I first started running in 2020, the Endorphin Speed 1 and Pro 1 were the first super shoes I ever used, so I have a bit of a sentimental attachment to the Endorphin line. 

Late last year I purchased both the Endorphin Pro 4 and the Superblast 2 and have gone up to put twice as many miles in the EP4. I've found that they are what some shoetubers claim the SB2 is: comfortable, lightweight, versatile and durable. After 250 miles, there's minimal outsole wear, so I see myself easily getting these up to 400 miles.

The only knock I have is that their energy return feels a notch below some other carbon plated shoes I've run in (e.g., Alphafly 1 and 3). 

**Positives:**

* Fit is true to size
* Comfortable upper
* Lightweight
* Outsole durability

**Negatives:**

* Missing that top-tier energy return

**Worth buying?:**

I'm happy with my purchase, but I know the $225 price tag is steep. When they invariably go on clearance some time this year, it'd be a no brainer to have these in a marathon training rotation.

1ip01hr,RunningShoeGeeks,Nike Alphafly 3 review after 220 miles,"**Total distance ran:**

220 miles (350 km)

**Type of runs:** 

I'm nearing the end of a marathon training block and primarily used these for my tougher quality sessions:

* 4x1 mile repeats
* 5x1 km intervals
* 4x2 miles at threshold
* 20-mile long runs with 10-12 at MP
* 21-mile progression runs

**My profile:**

Height: 6’0”

Weight: 160lbs

Weekly mileage: 70 miles (\~112km). 1:24 HM and 2:57 FM

Strike Type: Midfoot

**Overview:**

While it took an initial run to get used to these, over the past 200 miles, I've come to really like these for a wide range of workouts and haven't had a bad run in them. And compared to some other carbon-plated shoes I've used in the past, the AF3 leave my legs feeling much fresher the day after a quality session. Last thing I'll note is I really haven't noticed any degradation in the energy return, so I expect to be able to get another 100-150 quality miles out of them. 

**Positives:**

* Stable platform
* Super comfortable upper. 
* Easy to get a solid lockdown. 
* Amazing energy return

**Negatives**

* Lack of outsole durability compared to some other shoes I've used during marathon training (e.g., Adios Pro 3, Prime X Strung v1, Endorphin Pro 4)
* The cutout in the outsole doubles as a rock catcher. There are a lot of sweetgum trees where I live, and by the end of a long run, I had four sweetgum balls lodged in the outsole cutout. 

**Worth buying?:**

Yes.

1iokx1a,RunningShoeGeeks,361 Degrees Flame 3.0,"361 Flame 3.0 review

Quick personal running background for context:  
average weekly mileage - 30-40km (running somewhat consistently for 2 years)  
easy pace - 6/6:30 min per km  
threshold pace - 4:45/5:15 min per km  
previous shoes tried: Adidas Adios Pro 3, New Balance SC Elite V3, Asics Novablast 3 TR, Puma Velocity Nitro 2, New Balance 880 V12, Adidas Ultraboost 21  
current shoe rotation: Adidas Adios 8, Asics Superblast, 361 Flame 3.0  
foot size: 8.5-9 US, somewhat wide midfoot and very low arch

Bought the 361 Flame 3.0 to use as a speed/session shoe and for races, I plan to do a few 5k and 10k races and once my time gets lower I might try another 21km. I was a bit hesitant buying a running shoe (especially a race shoe with supercritical foam, a carbon fiber plate etc.) from a brand I never heard of before. After reading and watching a lot of reviews I decided to pull the trigger and at a cost of half or a third of other race shoes from other brands it felt like a fun experiment especially as I haven't had good experiences with supershoes from other brands.

Fit: surprisingly wide and accommodating even for my somewhat wide feet, I went my usual size and length and width were perfect. Some reviews saw it fits a bit big and I'd say if you have narrow feet then you might want to go a half size down. The upper is very minimal and reminds me of the Nike Vaporfly 2/3 which I prefer because I tend to overheat in most shoes so the upper one these are super breathable and dry very fast. The foam in the heel area is the perfect amount to me, good lockdown without being chunky. I usually have bad blister issues with most race shoes due to my low arch but these didn't give me any issues. A small feature but I really like the shoe laces, also similar to the Vaporfly where they are ribbed/textured so they stay tied really well. 

Midsole/Run feel: I knew going into it, from reading reviews, that it would be on the firm side of foams and it does feel that way (which I prefer). It feels like a firmer version of Adidas' Lightstrike Pro. I like being able to feel the ground and what my feet are doing so this is a huge pro to me but I know most might prefer a softer feel especially for long races or long time on feet runs. The bounce and propulsion is direct and snappy but I also feel alright during warm up paces, didn't feel the need to switch shoes at all before/after the reps. I mainly do 500-1000m reps and I feel the propulsion more at the faster speeds where it feels like the more you put in in terms of force the more you get out. I haven't tried them in a race yet but will definitely use them in my next 5k and 10k races. 

Outsole: While the outsole is quite thin even after 80km they barely have any wear, tread nubs are all still intact and I can imagine would be good for at least 400km. The cut outs in the outsole/midsole were a bit concerning with collecting rocks but haven't had that issue so far. The exposed parts of the midsole show a bit of wear (a bit dark) but no tearing or pieces coming off. The nubs are really nice and provide a lot of grip in all surfaces even damp/wet sidewalk and track which most race shoes don't do well.

**TDLR: The Flame 3.0 is a great race shoe option that I think most people will enjoy more than the race shoes from bigger brands that cost 2-3x more. In terms of running performance and comfort, I find it to be at par or even better than the big brands and looking forward to trying more running shoes from this brand and other lesser known ones.** 

Would like to hear others' thoughts about the shoe and maybe other lesser known brands. I'll do my best to answer any questions in the comments. 

Note: I’m from Southeast Asia making this brand and other similar Chinese ones fairly cheap and accessible compared to the western counterparts. I’m also a recreational runner who runs for fun and don’t really race/am not fast haha

1iocbej,RunningShoeGeeks,Adidas Adizero EVO SL follow up at 29 miles,"58 year-old mid/forefoot striker coming in at 5’8” and 150 lbs. Size 9 1/2 slightly narrow foot. Easy 9-10/mi, 7-7:15 5K, 7:30 10K, 8:15-8:30 half, 9 marathons ranging from a 3:27:16 BQ to over 4:30. Current shoe rotation: Asics Novablast 5 daily/long/recovery and Magic Speed 4 intervals, Saucony Kinvara 14 speed/hills and Endorphin Pro 3 marathon. Apple Watch Ultra 2 with the Apple Fitness app are my choices to keep track of things.

Initial voyage with the Adidas Adizero EVO SL was an easy 8 mile with a few sprints mixed in to test their speed and they felt great. Next was a 14 mile easy, with a ""let's see how fast these things can go"" push at the end sub-7:00 minute 14th mile. The foam did get slightly softer on the second run, which made the shoe feel even better. However, the thing I noticed most after these runs was that my legs were fresh during and after the run, as well as the day after. I've never experienced this when running this type of milage with any other shoe as there has always been a tinge of something afterwards. The upper breathes very well and, paired with some Feetures Max Cushion merino wool socks, never had an issue with my feet getting sweaty. The toe box is roomy, both in width and height, so I've experience no rubbing on my pinky or big toes.

Today was the test of speed: 5X 1K at 10K pace (set the app for < 7:20) followed by 5X 200m at 5K pace (set for < 7:00). Even though I set the pace to a little faster than my average, NEVER was I close to not hitting my times today. As a matter of fact, I actually had to pull back some. The Lightstrike Pro foam has superb energy return, and the rocker placement provides such a great transition when the pace is picked up. I don't know what happened, but the upper felt better today than on the previous two runs. Didn't lace them any different or change the style of socks: it just felt more supportive. The heel collar is very comfortable, too. I tried a little unconventional for me heel strike stride during the cooldown mile and this is just not a stable shoe for me when doing such, so I would think it's just not going to work for the vast majority of those that have that running style.

I'm going to flat out say that this is the best shoe I have ever laced up. Is it an excellent daily trainer? 100% yes. Speed/hills/intervals? Absolutely! Lightweight, versatile, responsive, doesn't beat up your legs, and one of the best looking shoes out there. Also, after 29 miles, you can see in the pic that the Continental rubber is showing no wear, so add high durability for the outsole as an expectation as well.

As long as you are a mid/forefoot striker, I think you will absolutely love this shoe. Only thing this shoe probably would not be my first choice for would be a recovery day shoe as I would want max cushion. I have a marathon coming up on the 23rd and plan on wearing these. The Endorphin Pro 3 is a great shoe, but it's pretty stiff due to the carbon-fibre plate and kills my legs late in a marathon. I've run a few marathons with the Novablast 3's (BQ shoe) and New Balance 1080's and this shoe is far superior, so I'm confident from my longer run experiences so far that the EVO SL will perform admirably. I'll post a follow up to let y'all know!

1io443c,RunningShoeGeeks,Bondi 9 - First Impressions from a heavier runner (114 kg / 250 lbs) and comparison to Bondi 8,"I tested the new Bondi 9 on a 12km (7.5 mile) run with pace 6:00 min/km or 9:40 min/mile. From my perspective as a heavier tall runner (114 kg/250 lbs and 194 cm 6'4"") the shoe is great daily trainer. I wouldn't take them for a speed session and would rather use my Skyward X for a long and recovery runs.
Compared to the Bondi 8 they are much softer and springier, but they don't have half the energy return of the Skyward X. The Bondi 8 feels like a walking shoe compared to the Bondi 9. The Bondi 9 is also much softer than the Skyflow, which I was considering as an alternative. The foot roll is similar to the Skyward X but without the bounce. The upper is more roomy than the Bondi 8, I have a narrow foot and have to tie the laces tighter than the Bondi 8. The foam in the Bondi 9 midsole is stiff enough for my 1-1.5 hour runs between speed sessions and long runs and makes up for it with springiness and softness that Bondi 8 lacked. 
I am happy with the purchase and can finally consider my rotation complete, for which I thank everyone who helped me with advice here!

Hoka Bondi 9 - easy daily
Hoka Skyward X - long runs / recovery

Adidas Adios Pro 3 review after 425 miles

**Type of runs:**

Everything from short 400m repeats @ 5:30/mi pace to very easy Z1 runs at 8:45-9:15/min pace. Used mostly as a daily trainer, more to that below.

**My profile:**

Height: 5’10”

Weight: 169lb

Weekly mileage: 35-45 miles 

Current fitness: 20:20 5k / 1:34 HM

**Strike Type:**

Midfoot during Z2, tempo and threshold. More forefoot for intervals / repetitions. Sometimes switch to a very light heel strike on slower recovery runs ~ 9:15/mi pace and slower.

**Positives:**

* Amazing midsole, soft yet very responsive and very comfortable for longer runs. Doesn’t loose its pop on long runs! 
* Breathable upper sheds water extremely well if running in the rain. Helps keep feet cooler in heat & humidity. 
*Contiental rubber is best in class… as good as PumaGrip even in the wet.
*CF energy rods are definitely more comfortable than a full length CF plate, yet still provide propulsive toe off paired with the aggressive rocker.
*Midsole feels great out of the box, and gets even better after 30-40 miles!
*Very durable and stable for a race shoe. 
*Relatively quiet ride, not slappy at all! 

**Negatives:**

* Adidas laces are worst in class. Seriously, can’t they spend $0.25 more per shoe for better laces?
* Upper has 3 major flaws: laces are trash, the first two eyelets closest to the toe box can chafe / blister the metatarsals on the top of your foot, and the tongue is extremely thin enabling lace bite. This makes lockdown problematic. 
*Unlike a full CF plate, the energy rods are more fragile and can be fractured / break. 
*Slightly heavy for a super shoe… 243g per shoe vs 200g for my Nitro Elite 3’s and 187g for Sky Paris.

**Overview:**

Just started running again in June 2024 after almost a decade off. I’m down 17lb and getting fit again, but still a long way off from my former fitness (18 min 5k). The technology in shoes now vs 2014 is astonishing… 

I found this pair of AP3 on /therunningrack for only $125 nearly new. Plan was to compare to my Deviate Nitro Elite 3’s for a race shoe. Between the two, I feel the Puma is a slightly faster shoe and 80g lighter per pair as well, with a fantastic upper. The AP3 is slightly more comfortable (energy rods, Lightstrike Pro, large cut out mid foot) and stable than the Puma race shoe, and after making some modifications to the upper, I fell in love with the midsole and ended up using the AP3 as a daily trainer. 

Other shoes I have tried to rotate in as a DT: ES3, SB2, NB5, Evo SL… and prefer to use the AP3’s mostly instead. I do still use the Evo SL and NB5 on occasion, but got rid of SB2 and ES3. Using the AP3 for 80% or more of my mileage caused niggles in my lower legs early on, but they have since adapted to the stiffer shoes. 

Compared to the Evo SL, the AP3 has a much larger cut out mid foot. This makes the AP3 ride slightly softer, even though the foam is the same and energy rods also better stabilize the shoe directing energy towards the toe off. 

Pretty sure I can take these to 550 or even 600 miles before retirement. They are just now starting to noticeably loose their pop after 400+ miles, but are still extremely comfortable and preferable to my nearly new Evo SL and NB5 (40-50 miles on each of those shoes). This is also purely subjective, but I feel like my legs are less beat up when using AP3 as a DT vs say a NB5 or ES3. 

They run true to size and have a generous amount of room in the toe box. I use the AP3 in size 10, same as all my other shoes (except DNE3 runs long, so I use 9.5). 

**Modifications**

Replacing the laces with stretchy lock laces, and adding a 3mm felt stick on tongue pad transforms the upper for me by eliminating lace bit, making lock down easy, and the flimsy super thin tongue have more structure to it. Cost was $15 on Amazon. Some people have also removed the offending eyelet using a razor blade to eliminate the chafe, but I don’t have to do that. 

**Worth buying AP3 or Evo SL?**

I paid $125 for the pair in this review, $120 for a 2nd pair with 25 miles on it, and $112.50 NIB for a 3rd pair of AP3 vs $165 for my Evo SL. For the $$ at the $150 price point, the Evo SL is probably going to be shoe of the year for 2025. But personally I’d rather still use the AP3 as a DT for my quality runs and longer Z2 runs. I think a specific difference in the ride is due to the large cut out mid foot in the AP3 (see photo) which the Evo SL lacks. I think this makes the ride both softer and snappier with the AP3. 

I do have a lactate test meter and could do some N1 experiments, but my intuition is that the Evo SL probably sits between a high end trainer and super shoe. ie it may give 1.5% benefit to economy vs 2.5-3% from a full on super shoe. So for the money, someone could mostly have their cake and eat it too using 1 pair of shoes to train and race in. Put another way, if the AP3 is 10-11s per mile faster than my NB5, the Evo SL I would guess saves 3-5 seconds per mile, if that makes sense. Again, just my intuition and I bet at some point they will get tested by someone in the lab. 

In the end, I plan to keep using both shoes but definitely prefer how the AP3 rides and will keep using it for my quality runs and long runs (racing in Nitro Elite 3).",2025-02-12 19:24:27+00:00,144,35

1inrwg5,RunningShoeGeeks,Adidas Evo SL 100 Mile Review - Perfect Supertrainer Does Not Exist,"Total distance ran: 96 miles (154 km)

My profile: 

M32, 184 cm (6 ft), 79 kg (174 lbs)

Strong forefoot striker. I land and bounce off rather than roll through.

Currently running around 45--50 mpw

Type of runs:

Anything between 3 and 16 miles, paces between easy (5:45 - 6:16 min/km), slower jogs with my partner (6:30-7:00 min/km), MP (5:15-5:30 min/km), threshold (4:20-4:30 min/km), speed workouts (4:30-3:00 min/km)

It is fair to say that I took them through my complete pace range from slow jogs 7:00min/km down to sub-3:00min/km sprints.



Weather ran in:

Typical British winter – between -2 and 7°C. No snow, a bit of ice on some days and lots of rain.

 

Positives:


Good lacing system and lock down.

Perfect amount of padding around the heel and tongue.

Soft, fun and bouncy foam

Midsole is a nice size – not too wide or intrusive.

Geometry very similar to Adios Pro 4.

Stunning design.

Good grip on wet and loose surfaces.

Hands down the best value for money offering in the “premium trainer” category

Availability – nice range of colourways available, many retailers with loads of stock.

Limited pre-launch availability – yes, I am listing this as a positive. More on that later.

 

Negatives:

Fun ride, but not very directional. Lack of stiffening elements in the midsole makes the bounce a bit chaotic.

Waaay too much volume in the upper for my narrow feet. Major material bunching up issues.

Upper runs a bit hot, even in cold weather.

Tongue could be a bit longer and gusseted, but no major issues.

No stability features combined with a superfoam – stay away if you get stability issues.

Short break-in period.

 

My thoughts on pricing, launch and availability (skip this part if you’re just here for the shoe review):

When I first saw this shoe announced last year, I remember my first comment on this sub was “Full length Lightstrike Pro midsole for £130? Insta buy”. That was a few months ago, but I did just that – bought them as soon as they dropped with Start Fitness last month. It was a no-brainer for me at that price considering that similar shoes with similar pedigree are typically in the £160-200 range these days. I had the opportunity to buy them in the pre-release but I opted not to because I had other shoes to use back then and limited budget.

Now here is my personal opinion on the pre-release from Adidas. You might have noticed I listed this as one of the positives in the section above. I was also quite vocal about this in several comments on other posts. There was a lot of hate and frustration from this community on how Adidas is limiting supply to try and generate hype. I do not understand that point of view when Adidas always made it clear from day one that launch is early 2025 and the drops in 2024 were just pre-release. Adidas could have easily done what all brands do – only send these to YouTubers and press and ignore the customers. Instead they decided to share the shoes early with the public in a raffle. Nothing negative about it if you ask me. Apart from the bitter taste left in the mouth of those who couldn’t get a pair.

The availability now, post launch, is impressive. Quite a few colourways to choose from and stock available with most retailers from day one, with some (like Start Fitness) dropping stock weeks ahead of launch. If anything, other brands could learn from Adidas on how to properly launch a product. Rant over, moving on to the actual review.

 

Upper, fit and comfort:
 
The upper is a big let down for me personally. It started off well out of the box. The construction and materials looked great at first glance. Then I put the shoes on and realised that there is just far too much material in the mid to forefoot section for my normal width feet. It bunches up to the bottom of the laces, pressing the material against my toes, especially on my left foot which is slightly smaller. This is slightly uncomfortable and very unwelcome in what I thought was meant to be a race’ish fitting shoe. Luckily despite feeling that once I put the shoes one, that feeling disappears a few minutes into the run and (touch wood) had no chaffing or blisters so far as a result of that.

In terms of sizing, length wise they fit true to size. I went with my usual UK 9 and had no issues. Width wise as mentioned above the shoe is too wide for me and I might consider going for a women’s size next if I buy another pair.

Because there is too much volume, I tried to offset it with thicker socks, namely the Feetures Max Cushion and also some generic Nike Multiplier ones. That did not work out too well for me as I quickly found out the upper is not as breathable as it looks. Back to thin racing socks then – pictured Adidas x Adizero socks, but Feetures Elite Ultra Light Cushion seem to work ok as well in the current temperatures. I am dreading running in these in the summer to be honest.

Saying that, 10 minutes into the run with the right socks on, I experienced no issues and could comfortably do 16 miles in them. I can definitely see people taking them to marathon distance with no fuss.

No issues with lacing or the tongue. Although a longer, gusseted tongue would be very welcome in the next iteration. It’s awkward but does not cause any problems.

 

Midsole

This is where the magic starts. This is where everyone put their hopes in and claimed this is the shoe of 2025 before 2025 even started. Before Adidas announced the Evo SL, no one expected full superfoam midsoles at this price. I remember when the Rebel v4 launched and I criticised it for not having a full-PEBA midsole but a EVA/PEBA blend itself. All hell broke loose and I was heavily downvoted by the fan boys (and girls presumably) all saying sHoW mE AnOtHEr fUlL pEbA mIDsoLe fOR £140. Well, I would like to introduce you to the Evo SL, a £130 trainer featuring proper superfoam. Technically not PEBA, but we all know that long gone are the days of go PEBA or go home.

It had a very brief break in period. My first run was a 14 mile run with a bit of goal pace. By mile 10 I could already feel they softened up a lot. I have always been against shoes which need any sort of breaking-in, but I can forgive a 10 mile one. The shoes effectively broke in before I finished my first run.

Now I feel that what I am about to say next might cause a bit of controversy. The shoe that the Evo SL brought to my mind is the Nike ZoomX Invincible Run Flyknit (couldn’t help myself with the full name lol) – or as normal people called it the OG Nike Invincible. That shoe was fun as hell, bounced all over the place. I feel like today, years after Nike released the Invincible, someone from the Nike product design team was hired by Adidas and told to continue working on it.

Evo SL is exactly that – an incredibly fun and bouncy ride. The shoe compared to the Invincible shrunk in size (tick), weight (tick) and price (tick). This is everything that I wished the Invincible 3 would be. The Evo SL, as I said in one of my comments on the sub, feels like a happy little brother of the more grown-up Boston 12. The only problem with that is that the bounce lacks a bit of direction. Just like the Invincible, this shoe bounces well but is not quite sure which direction to go next. The rocker makes it a bit better compared to the Invincible, but it’s nothing like the forward-propulsion we see from stiffer supertrainers like the Boston, Superblast or Endorphin Speed.

For that reason alone, even thought I did some of my long runs in them and even though I did a couple of quality speed sessions in them, I will not continue to use them for either of those. They will be my happy daily trainers, for which I reach mid-week on easy/moderate runs where I want to have a bit of fun, listen to funky music and just bounce along to it. My workouts will be covered by my trusty Vaporflies and my long runs by my even trustier Superblasts. I don’t want excitement and fun during my long run or when I’m sprinting out of breath. I want a solid, performance-focused tool and Evo SL unfortunately fall slightly short of the expectations there. If I was to use them as most supertrainers (so multi-use), I would like to see some form of semi-stiff plate in there, or at least a stiffer carrier foam layer like in the Superblasts.

However, this is all driven by my personal preferences, not lack of performance. The Evo SL is still a great performer and very versatile. It just doesn’t feel right, not like something I would like to wear every day.

 

Outsole

I’ll keep this section brief – I experienced zero issues with grip. Concrete, road, dirt roads – dry and wet – all good.



Worth buying?

Overall it’s a great shoe and a welcome addition to my rotation. It replaced the Pegasus Plus which, even thought it served me well and which I enjoyed, wasn’t half as fun as the Evo SL.

Is it worth buying? Yes, yes and yes. For £130 to have a shoe bringing such enjoyment and style to running is unheard of. It is insane value for money and I hope that Adidas continue to prove other brands wrong in that regards.

 

Who should avoid?

DO NOT buy this if you have stability issues. It’s not the shoe for you and you’re likely going to hurt yourself.

1inka02,RunningShoeGeeks,Adidas Boston 13- First Run Impressions,"M31, 6ft, 105KG, Mostly up to half marathon distance,

I was lucky enough to grab a pair of the Boston 13's at that weird mini-release a few days ago and was able to get a run in today, only 8km. That being said as a Boston 12 owner and lover, I had high expectations. As a disclaimer, as is obvious, I am quite heavy and slow and very much a beginner runner, so my analysis is not in-depth or not made for more experienced runners, so I will very much be using beginner runner language. Also, 8km is not a lot, so this can of course change with the mileage, especially as Boston is known for a late break-in time.

Ride- The ride feels slightly more energetic, but more of less the same as the 12, which is a good thing for me. Why mess up something that isnt broken? That being said, if you found the ride firm before then this will not change your mind. I believe this has a touch bit more lightstrike pro? but in the end it's more of less the same. The traction grip from Adidas is very good compared to the full Continental rubber, but I still prefer Full Continental.

Fit- Holy moly this is narrow, I fit comfortably into the 12, a bit snug but not too bad, but as you can tell from the pics my feet are being squeezed. I have about a thumb gap from the big toe, so I know it isn't long, but I have to say that it was so narrow that I almost want to recommend a half-size up by default, that being said if you get to test in store, even better as it will save you time. Otherwise, the fit was good, not great.

Energy- I have no research to back this up but the energy and specifically the rods felt a bit more energetic than the 12, but not nearly enough to notice significantly or even say that this is worth the full $160, assuming it won't be on sale for a while, over a discounted 12.

Durability- 8km is nothing, so nothing to report on yet, that being said just feeling the shoe, I have no doubt this shoe will retain the insane levels of durability the Boston 12 did, I am hoping it has less of a break in time too

Value- If you get the fit correct, this is a great value just like the 12 and since there are minor upgrades all around, and the upper/heel counter is greatly approved, this is a good step up from the 12 and a legit all around/value super trainer. That being said if the 12 has worked well for you, then might as well stock up on that if you can find a discount

Overall- Very good, still very fun, still very firm, still a great value, but very narrow.

I will report back with more mileage, around 100km or so!

1in2iex,RunningShoeGeeks,361 Titan CQT,"Hi there,

I thought I’d post a quick first thought on these and will come back after a 100 miles or so. 

Historically I’ve worn stability shoes due to significant over pronation. Battled injuries and niggles, variety of PT etc and after a few years, switched to neutral shoes and generally this has proved so much better for me. However, from time to time I get some ankle pains / knee pains and even though I tend to run in “stable” neutral shoes, race shoes tend to give me a bit of grief as they are often a little less stable than I’d like. 

Anyway, I wanted to add a shoe to my rotation that was a little more stable than my neutral only ones.

Currently enjoying the Ride 17 for easy, Rebel 4 for tempo, rocket X for speed, and SC Trainer for longer stuff. have some others i mix in from time to time. 

So, for adding for easy I decided to add something aimed to be stable. I did not want to spend much as I was not sure if I would like it again or it might make some issues worse. So I decided to get something from 361. I have quite flat feet and find Chinese shoes very good for flat feet and wide feet. 

This lead me to the 361 Titan. I got it delivered to the UK, all in for £52 so excellent value. I know they have a UK / EU store, but the models always seem old and same prices as EU / US brands so never bother and always use Ali Express. 

Anyway, popped them on and they feel very light compared to the Ride’s and no arch bump, yay!

They are classed as stability shoes but I can’t really feel anything “hard” in the foot,  they just feel nicely stable and light. They are also quite light and bouncy with good energy return. Makes the Ride feel like a brick to be honest. The midsole is a supercritical ETPU and feels very good so far.

Went out for a 6 mile run and did 9. Obviously not magic shoes, but felt good cruising along about 8min mile pace.

Insole looks cheap, but works. Anyway, seem great value for the money. 

Sizing is odd. I’m normally UK 11 or UK 11.5. 361 have different conversions on different shoes, so 46/47 is sometimes 10 or could be 11 depending on the model. And I don’t mean fit that way, the labels might both stay 47, but on one 11 and the other 11.5 etc.

This model runs large. I bought largest they had. 46 which I thought was an 11 but arrived as 46/10. Should be way too small but fit great. 

Anyway, I recommend so far. Might not be good for those in the US with the new “china” tax though…",2025-02-11 16:25:16+00:00,30,4

1imqe5b,RunningShoeGeeks,Dynafish Danian 1.0 (Is this my Evo SL?),"Low price, check.
Supercritical midsole, check.
Minimal plate/shank, check.
Versatile, check.    

I was one of the hordes who were very excited when Adidas announced the Evo SL. What a great concept, essentially a stripped down marathon shoe that is more versatile and retains a supercritical midsole.     

I know they are becoming more available, but the marketing hype and drip feeding of stock to consumers, along with the crazy lotteries just left a foul taste in my mouth. Maybe I'll get one later on, but as of right now I'm not going to play your game Adidas.     

Enter the Dynafish/Danian 1.0.
My understanding is that the factory DMN that produces the midsole decided to release their own shoe, and that cutting of the middleman allows an insanely cheap price. I only paid $100 AUD inc delivery to get this shoe.    

The Dynafish is a big slab of PEBA midsole with a 4mm drop and a resin/carbon composite 3/4 length plate which is more like rods/forks. The plate looks to be more mid to forefoot. The package is very soft and the step in comfort as well as running is obvious. The midsole is the star here and honestly just a joy to run in. Very plush.   

The upper is a relatively soft and flexible mesh with a nice structured heel (similar to the Evo SL), and it comes with serrated laces that I love. The fit though is where many will come unstuck. This is a narrow shoe. Narrowness doesn't bother my foot generally and I get a really good fit and lock down with my heel, but the toebox tapers quickly and becomes quite pointed. According to the cm measurement I stuck with my standard 260mm length which is my normal US 8, but works out as a smaller than normal EU size. I'm able to get away with it, but in hindsight a half size larger would have been better. That is purely due to the toe box encroaching on the big toe. The length of shoe past the second toe is good.    

The outsole is CPU which would usually hold up well, but there are definitely some question marks regarding longevity due to how sparse the outsole is. There are large areas of the sole that is exposed peba foam. Time will tell.    

Did I say this was light? This is incredible. My US 8 weighs, feels like a feather on foot. I haven't weighed my pair but the the specs state a US9 is 157g.    

I've run 12 km in these, there is a late rocker but the geometry isn't super aggressive. The light weight and bounce of the peba just makes leg turnover so easy. I put this through 4:15 to 5:30 pace and it felt good at all paces easily picking up the pace while not feeling awkward running slower. It  feels quite stable too for such a lightweight shoe which I think is because of the plate but also a relatively flat base with no cut outs.    

For now this is my Evo SL.

1imh4nq,RunningShoeGeeks,Saucony Munchen 4S,"While looking for a new pair of shoes as my Saucony Ride 15's are ready to retire, I stumbled upon these Munchen 4S model. After some research, it seems these are sold overseas only and someone said they are popular in Germany. Walmart was also selling online. I paid about $55.00 USD. I also found that these are the ""stability"" model of the Munchen as they also have a plain 4, and have newer models 5 and 5S. 

It was only after I bought them that I realized they had some stability built in and say they are for minor to moderate over-pronators, so they're not a 1-for-1 replacement for my Rides (which are neutral). For the most recent model, the 5 and 5S, they have done away with the sewn-on toe cap and it is integrated onto the fabric. On the website I used for reference, they were priced a few dollars more than the Peregrine 12 and the Ride 15. I know these are probably pretty basic trainers and I'll give them I try-out tomorrow - I don't run long distances (more than 4 or 5 miles at a time) and I'm not a fast runner either, more of a jog probably. 

I searched Reddit and only saw a passing mention of them but was curious to find out which US model, if any, these may be based off of.  Neither the tread nor the uppers look like a twin for any other Saucony model but I would think it might be the ""European"" model of a US shoe. PWRRUN RS isn't even noted in the Glossary on the Saucony site. I've attached 2 photos and also have the description below as was written on the website startfitness.co.uk:

I've had these nearly a full year so they've seen summer runs on pavement, wet and rainy fall runs, icy or snowy or frigid winter runs. 90% of the miles were on asphalt and 10% on dirt trails and roads. Maybe a half dozen times I've used them with Yaktrax (velcro-on spikes), which I don't prefer as they're uncomfortable. But they've been ankle-deep in puddles on rainy days, out at -10F (-23C) in the winter, and tons of just regular use day after day.

**My profile:**  
5'9"", 155 lbs, 37M, 170-190 steps/min, midfoot or forefoot based on wear pattern.

**About me:**  
I bought these for all-around use on daily jogs. I had them fitted at my local running club store (Shoutout Mill City Running!), I was looking for something durable that fit my stride well and didn't look radioactive. 2022-2023 were slower running years for me with starting a family, and buying these shoes March 2024 coincided with a re-invigorated interest in training. I've been a regular runner for two decades now, but seldom above 20 miles per week, and only had one or two shoes that I've really clicked with like these.

These shoes took me from that 20 mpw to 40-45 mpw. My goal in 2024 was to train for a 10-mile race last fall. After that, it was to be ready for half marathons this year, but also I really needed to improve my speedwork, so both long runs and intervals.

**Positives:**  
These things have taken a lot of abuse and held up well. The laces are great, I can cinch them down pretty hard and not feel too tight- but still have good heel lock. They dry out great- Like I said, I've taken them ankle-deep in puddles, put them under an air vent, and been back out the next night to do it all over again. Plenty of other shoes have that squishy feeling, maybe water getting trapped in the insole, which was not my experience with the Ride 17s.

The toe box is still in decent shape for 1000 miles. My big toe always sticks up, and a hole in the toe is consistently the first thing to go on a lot of my pairs. You can see it's starting on these. Some reviews have mentioned breathability as a problem for these shoes, that has not been an issue for my experience, even on hot days.

For me, the fit is perfect. I've got a wider forefoot and don't like having my toes squished together. I've had ASICS Gel-DS trainers that have caused injuries from my pinky toenail digging in- it sounds minor but hurts a ton. Not an issue with these shoes.

**Negatives:**  
Traction is a bit of a problem. They're a little slick, especially downhill on icy/wet surfaces. Some of that I'm sure is due to wear of the treads, but there's one spot on my route that's a downhill turn where I always feel like I need to take it wide or I'll bang into a lightpost. Those first few winter runs of the year, you need to adjust your gait a little bit and honestly slow down to keep your balance. I've wiped out on the ice in these once, which might sound merely embarrassing but is actually kind of dangerous.

They're not a ""fast"" shoe, so speed training has always felt a little clunky.

**Other thoughts:**  
The heel fabric is starting to wear through, though it's definitely overdue.

These were ""True To Size"", I wear a 10.5 in just about everything and the fit for these has been right on.

I think the bounce started to fade around 400-500 miles. There's still some left, but it doesn't have that springy feeling like they did new. Which is honestly fine for me logging a ton of easy miles. I would have expected some kind of pain or fatigue as the foam flattens out, but nothing hurts yet.

What's next? Well, I've liked these so much I bought two additional pairs of Ride 17s on sale. I'm hoping to ride these out through the winter before switching to something else, and then these are getting retired to a lifetime of lawncare.

1ilhsdr,RunningShoeGeeks,"Nike Pegasus Premium first run - Honestly, kinda lives up to the hype","Let me Begin by saying that I am not a Nike person at all. I just have never been able to connect with their shoes. Of course I was incredibly doubtful about having an air unit across the entire midsole. But I tried these today during a run with a club that got them available for a demo, and man did they blow my mind.

Sizing is pretty true to size. I wear a 10 and a half and mostly everything and these where perfect. I would size up to an 11 if I wanted some more room but my usual size was just fine. As reference, I wear a 10.5 in Superblast 2, SL2, Glycerin Max; 11 in Magic Speed 3 and Noosa Tri 16. 

I had  a bit of heel slip so I had to tie them using a runner's knot and that fixed the issue. The air unit is incredibly bouncy and cushioned, I was honestly not expecting such a responsive run. I didn't have a single issue while running with them and they felt perfectly fine at slower and faster paces. I could feel the response every step I took and after the first mile I just stopped noticing, they just felt great. They still have enough firmness to not feel like you're sinking and enough to speed up. The upper fits great and is very breathable. The tongue is padded and stayed in place without issue throughout the run. 

Grip was fine, I ran on wet streets and had no issues. My feet fell fine and refreshed after the run. These feel to me like the type of shoe that you pick up when you are just trying to have fun and not concentrate on breaking any records or pushing it too much. I might just be a little bit excited about trying a new shoe but I honestly don't feel like these would bring any issues if I kept running in them. 

I am also recovering from a left hamstring injury and this was my first harder effort after a couple weeks without running, and I did not feel any kind of pain or discomfort while or before running, which is more than I can say about a run I attempted a week ago in my SL2s, so not sure if the actual shoe made a difference or if I was just better recovered, but regardless, they were a joy to run in. I'm sure I'm also overly excited about trying a new shoe, but despite trying other Nike shoes before, these feel refreshed and actually innovative.

I'm not sure if I would add one of these to my rotation, but all my skepticness about the air unit been a gimmick is honestly gone. It was fun to run in them and the bounce was honestly exciting. They also look really nice. Only reason I wouldn't buy a pair for myself is because I don't see a gap in my rotation that these would fit in, but whenever I can't sleep and I'm browsing shoes to buy this one would probably be a big contender.",2025-02-09 15:56:09+00:00,315,160

1ilcry0,RunningShoeGeeks,Adidas adizero Adios 9 ~250 km review: low stack super shoe.,"**About me:** Easy runs around 4:10/km, 74 kg. Predominantly a heel striker, but in low-drop shoes, it shifts more to the front. I run all kinds of distances up to marathons.

First of all, I don't use rotation because I don't like the choice, and I'm not convinced it matters when shoes are comfortable enough. Thus, Adios 9 is my daily trainer. Before them, I used SL2 and earlier various Novablasts 3 and 1, as well as the S/Lab Phantasm CF. The last time I had lower-stack shoes was around three years ago. I bought them because I have a pretty poor running technique which leads to a back pain and low stack shoes, from what I read, help in this matter.

**Positives:** The shoe utilises Adidas' latest technologies—an extremely comfortable upper, the newest Lightstrike Pro, and the latest outsole. Thanks to the new foam, the shoes are soft and bouncy with exceptionally good energy return. It may be that the foam gets softer with mileage, but I'm not sure, as I started running in these after a few weeks’ break due to injury, so I was slower, my legs hurt somewhat after each run, and my body had to adjust to the low-drop shoes. SL2 feels like clogs in comparison, especially during faster runs, and is significantly less fun. There's a ground feeling, but it's pretty nice.

The outsole is fantastic—grippy and extremely durable. By contrast, the outsole of SL2 wasn’t very durable and made it difficult to run on our perfect Dutch tarmac, especially when wet and uphill.

Adios 9 is more comfortable during faster runs than during easy ones, but it's so comfortable that I could probably run a marathon in them (that was actually my aim before writing this review, but because I’m slowly returning to my optimal form, I skipped it). I have done a few longer runs in them, though (slightly above half-marathon distance), and my legs felt fresh afterwards.

**Negatives:** I always use the same size in Adidas shoes (46 2/3). SL2 was slightly too small, whereas Adios 9 is slightly too wide and generally too big.

Yesterday, I noticed that one of the stripes had started to peel off—possibly due to winter conditions and salt on the streets. Furthermore, sometimes Adios 9 feels a bit unstable, especially during easy runs while heel striking. Also, I usually end up running faster in them than I intend.

**Conclusion**  
If you are a lighter and faster runner, I don’t see benefits of buying either Bostons or Evo SL. However, I can imagine that Pro 4 is an ultimate chef's kiss.

1iki8mp,RunningShoeGeeks,Brooks Hyperion Elite 4 PB First Run,"Background: 127lbs, 168cm and running for a little over 2 years.

After hearing about how disappointing the hyperion elite 4 was, I didn't pull the trigger on it. But the PB kept everything good about the regular elite 4, and gave it a midsole that was on par with it's competitors, so I was very eager to try it.

I took it out for 2×2km threshold @3:45/km + 10×200 @2:50/km and I have to say, it feels like how a super shoe should feel. The foam feels way better than brooks' outdated dna flash, but still very much a brooks shoe; so a little on the firm side, but that's how I prefer my speed and race day shoes. It has that traditional 'low' super shoe plate position, which gives me that rolling sensation I really enioy. 

The upper is the best upper I have ever had on any shoe. Extremely breatheable, snug, and lightweight. Brooks has done a really great job with their uppers on their 2024 shoes. I would've liked the tongue to be gusseted, but that's pretty minor. Had absolutely no issues with heel lockdown, even with the minimal padding in the heel.

Can't say much about the outsole as I've only done 1 run on a treadmill, but I expect it to be quite durable as there's a good amount of rubber coverage, especially for a race/speed day shoe.

Brooks finally has a legitimate race day option, and I can't wait to see their 2025 racing products with their new peba foam, specifically their spikes. I will be doing a follow up once I do a workout with them on the track, because for me, shoes never feel the same on the treadmill and outdoors.",2025-02-08 07:53:03+00:00,154,9
1ikgank,RunningShoeGeeks,Adidas Adizero EVO SL First Run,"5’8” mid/forefoot striker coming in at 150 lbs. Slightly narrow foot and used to wear a size 9, but now 9 1/2 is the norm to keep my toenails intact.

[Lucid Lemon is just....lucid!](https://preview.redd.it/k1ns0tu6xeie1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1bd279a6a53233c6d72038f216cefc863d40f67e)

My initial plan was to run a 5-mile easy jog to get a feel for the EVO's, but it turned into an over 8-mile run with a few fast 1/4-mile intervals mixed in.

Positives for the EVO SL:

* Lightstrike Pro foam. Firmly soft with excellent energy return and cushioning. Felt better after each mile.
* I felt I was squarely in a mid-foot strike position in these shoes. The advanced rocker position comes up quick, quicker than any other shoe I've worn. This makes for excellent toe off and transition.
* Great grip provided by the Continental rubber in the forefoot. Absolutely zero wear after 8+ miles.
* Lightweight. According to the Adidas website, they come in under 8 ounces in a size 9. This is surprising, seeing how they are so cushioned.
* Roomy toe box. I did not experience any rubbing at all, which I normally have a little on my outer pinky toes.
* Upper provides good, but not great, support. They breathe very well, which is going to be a huge positive in the Texas summer heat.
* No plate! Plated shoes kill my legs for the next day or two afterwards, so no issues here.
* Lucid lemon colorway is so cool that you just can't not see them coming your way!

Negatives (no shoe is perfect):

* Slightly unstable due to the narrow heel and would not recommend for heel strikers.
* The fit was slightly loose as the upper has a lot of height. However, I do go up 1/2 size over my ""normal"" for a reason already divulged, and I could not tie them down snugly without cinching the upper a just a bit, which is probably the cause. It really didn't bother me, though, as I wore highly cushioned merino socks (game changers), so this really may be a non-issue for most.
* Cheap shoe laces. Same as on the old Adizero SL's. Would have thought they would have improved by now. Double knot and you are fine.

My favorite daily/long run shoe has been the Novablast 5, and use the Endorphin Pro 3 for marathons. Not a popular choice for a lot of folks, but I frickin' love the Kinvara 14 for hills and speed work. I have tried a few Adidas shoes in the past and just found them to be clunky (Boston 12, Adios Pro 3) or the foam too hard (Adizero SL). However, the EVO SL appears to have changed everything and is going to be in the running for my favorite daily AND speed/hill shoe. These shoes really want to get up and go, and are good in zone 2 slow as well, stability concerns notwithstanding. Have a feeling that the EVO will excel at progression runs, too. Comparing the EVO to the NB 5's as they are both considered daily trainers, the Asics has the softer ride, is bouncier and has a wider heel for better stability during long runs. I just can't wait to put some more miles on these bad boys, though!",2025-02-08 05:44:00+00:00,101,94
1ik2773,RunningShoeGeeks,Brooks Hyperion Elite 4 PB,"So, I think we all know that Brooks hasn't really had a competitive race day option as they haven't used Peba...until now. I'm a running shoe junkie and when I saw that they were re-doing the Hyperion Elites with Peba, I was very curious to feel Brooks' interpretation of the foam. I did not come away disappointed!

Sizing: TTS.

Let's start with the upper...this is one of the best racing uppers out there. Incredibly breathable (you can feel the wind through the upper!), yet light and supportive. Highly comfortable as well. The sawtooth laces that Brooks uses should really be standard on any super shoe. Love them on the Alphafly/Vaporfly and love them here. There is a bit of a heel collar that is just enough to keep your Achilles from getting rubbed.

As far as the midsole and ride, this is fantastic. It is a little more gentle of a rocker than other super shoes I have recently tried (Adios Pro 4 is an aggressive one), but when you give this foam effort it MOVES. My workout was 6 miles with 4 at threshold and I had to hold myself in check to avoid encroaching on 5k paces. Snappy, propulsive, slightly denser than ZoomX but really feels good and quite stable for a super shoe. I'd compare this DNA Gold Peba similarly with Hoka's Peba in the Rocket X2/Cielo X1. 

This is a simple, no frills super shoe that in a way is refreshing as so many shoes have gotten crazy complex. I got vibes of the Vaporfly Next %2's in a great way, with a slightly more accommodating fit. A+ stuff, Brooks. Excited to see how they use this foam in other implementations in the Hyperion Max 3 and Elite 5. This shoe is also extremely light, I did not weigh it but it feels on par with the Vaporfly and Adios Pro 4 and maybe only a few grams heavier than the Metaspeed Edge Paris. Lighter than the Endorphin Pro 4 by a good bit and that is not a heavy shoe either.

Finally, the outsole...no qualms. I would highly recommend this for anyone looking for a super shoe with no fuss, that is accommodating for a variety of paces and footstrikes. You don't have to change your form or really adapt to a crazy rocker here, and in a way my feet are a lot happier with the slightly more natural feel here. Happy to answer questions.

1ijjmxn,RunningShoeGeeks,Qiaodan Feiying PB 5.0,"TLDR: Very nice marathon race day shoe. Super lightweight, stable (perhaps the 'lower' stack helps here), good traction, easy turnover, smooth ride. Fit and feel is awesome for me as well (offers some arch support). These are top quality racing shoes!

* Price: $104 (total - before all the recent tariff nonsense! Ordered from AliExpress on Jan 14; arrived at my door on Jan 22 (Southern California)).
* Size: US Mens 9 (EUR 42.5); seems to fit me TTS (I wear a 9 in the AP3, Superblast 2, Boston 12).
* Weight: \~197g (6.9 ounces) (used my coffee scale - there was a <1g difference between left and right)
* Drop: 7mm (34/27)
* Pics: [https://imgur.com/a/ZgbO4YT](https://imgur.com/a/ZgbO4YT)

My use case: The main thing that attracted me to these were the mentions of arch support in the marketing and the 'lower' stack height. One review I found on YouTube mentioned they were on the firmer side as well (reading the reviews of the AP4 have scared me away from them as I don't like 'soft'). I am in search of a race day shoe (I am NOT fast by any means) - I quite loved my AP3s, but they did give me a small blister issue. So I bought these and the Saucony EP4s to see which I like best. (Inspired to try these after reading this recent post: https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/comments/1i0b365/comment/m74nzqj/?context=3&rdt=47278)

* Unboxing impressions: These come in a fancy, heavyweight box. The details and design in just the box are very nice, so I was super excited for the shoes right away given the quality of packaging. (Yes, I know it's just a box, but it's a \*really\* nice box!) The color is listed as Flaming Red/Jordan White (translated); they're more orange/red or flamin' hot red than deep red (the online pictures made them look a bit deeper red to me).
* The upper: A knit mesh. Looks like lots of air flow. It's a bit 'plasticy' like the AP3. Gives off racing shoe vibes for sure. The heel counter is a rigid piece on the back (it's the area with the 42.195km mark). The rest of the back is lightly cushioned, with a bit more padding around the collar. The laces have the 'caterpillar' on the ends (basically just the part you would tie) but the rest of the laces are flat. A nice detail. The laces are a touch stretchy. The tongue is secured only on the inside (medial) side of the shoe by a few stitches (if you look at the pics you can see the stitches just under the eyelets). It's a minimal tongue - feels a lot like the AP3 to me.
* The midsole: Dual density layered midsole. The gold shimmery layer is softer, and the bottom red layer is stiffer. So it looks like the forefoot is going to have some bounce (this maybe isn't for heel strikers?).

First run(s) impressions:

* First run was 3 miles on a treadmill - various paces, but mostly just to get a feel for them and work out lacing, etc. - just wanted to make sure they felt good before taking them outside. Fit is very nice 'race day' type feel.
* Second run was 18 miles long run - these felt really good! No blisters or hot spots, adequate arch support. I'd say these were pretty stable, better than the AP3 for me. Bounce was good (although I am wondering if they'll loosen up a touch with a few more miles in them). Traction was really good too (it was lightly raining or wet pavement for much of the run). Overall very solid shoe that could definitely be a great marathon racer. It's so lightweight, turnover just kept me going along - just did what they needed too and it was one of those shoes I didn't really notice which is always good.
* Third run was 6 miles with some sprints - Again these felt great. Easily can pick up the pace in these - definitely felt a bit bouncier, so very good energy return.",2025-02-07 01:44:14+00:00,23,7

1ij7ezr,RunningShoeGeeks,Mizuno Neo Zen 25 mile thoughts,"
Me: male, age 47, 156 pounds, 5K pace 6:45, 40-50mpw, unrepentant heel striker, currently in the Mach 6 and Skyflow.

I was a huge fan of Mizuno shoes from around the Wave Rider 9 to 13, but after the disastrous WR 14 and the rise of the minimalism insanity around that time their shoes were left to be boring, conservative, and archaic. The Neo Vista changed all of that in an instant and the Zen feels like the next step in what hopfully is Mizuno's return to relevance.

Initial runs were 5-8 easy miles on pavement, around an 8:30-9:00 pace.

Fit: Tried my normal 9.5 D, shoe runs TTS. The upper does look a little weird, and it's a bit more difficult than some shoes to get on, but once on the foot it really does disappear. No rubbing or hotspots or weird bunching up. I could potentially see some people finding the fit a little loose but after a few months of running in the Skyflow I really don't mind it. At any rate, it's light and comfortable.

Ride: It's bouncy and fun without being unstable or mushy. I love it. I don't think I would race in this, but for daily miles I am expecting this to be an incredible shoe. It truly feels like a modern running experince and not just another slab of ""meh"" foam. I am sensitive to shoes that have inadequate forefoot cushioning, and this shoe has plenty. Not the snappiest toe-off, and I hate to use a cliched word like ""smooth"" but that's what it is.

Preliminary Conclusion: The best shoe Mizuno has put out in 15 years, and one of the best I have run in recently. If you are looking for an unplated daily trainer to eat up miles and add some fun to the process give it a look.

Comparisons:

Mach 6: The Mach is the faster and more responsive shoe but not as comfortable for longer daily miles, I will be using it in rotation with the Zen for now.

Novablast 5: The NB is more narrow, heavier, and firmer. Honestly it's a boring lump of a shoe and I don't understand its appeal.

Rebel v4: The Rebel is wider, firmer and probably more stable but has neither the bounce and comfort of the Zen nor the response of the Mach.

Dn2 - mid (250km)



This is an initial review, just ran 5km, easy with this. 

Upper - feels like Novablast 3. Stretchy and a bit thicker that I like. Noticed that is gets warm. Though I usually run in 27c+ temps. I’m a size 9 and was worried sizing will be off as I read that you need to size down but this is TTS for me. The laces are not the best and the lacing is weird so just change it. You can also do a runners knot

Midsole – feels like novablast 3. Squishy with a bit of responsiveness. Not too mushy like the freshfoam where it absorbs everything and doesn’t respond. This for me cushions your feed and gives a bit of feedback. Will probably use this for long runs. Have yet to try faster paces and will update this thread.

Outsole – no comments, didn’t feel anything out of the ordinary. 
Price – purchased for around 65USD shipped from China to PH. Given the price performance ratio, I’m eager to test out other shoes from China and this brand.",2025-02-06 02:05:51+00:00,18,16

Upon quick browse I saw a size 8, 8.5, 10, and 10.5 available as of time of posting this; nothing for the ladies unfortunately.  Also check your local Winners/Marshalls as they could also have them (College Park Winners/Aura Marshalls did not have them however).  Do note Pwrrun Bio + foam is said to feel and perform differently from the regular Pwrrun+, and upon quick try on, they do feel differently from the standard… I did feel slightly less dense feeling and less bounce on these vs my Runshield pair, though this is of course only from walking around.  They also fit super wide, definitely wider than the standard (even though the sizing tag did not denote Wide) and the upper is a knit with a lot of stretch, so could be great for wider footed folks.  If anything I think it could make for a great casual/running mix shoe, the white upper and midsole with gum outsole looks super nice!  ",2025-02-05 18:50:26+00:00,43,8
1iigjxe,RunningShoeGeeks,Mizuno Neo Zen initial thoughts (50km),"About me: 143lbs (64kg), 5ft6 (167cm), size 9.5 US m in 90% of brands

I’ve ran in this shoe for about 50km now and sharing my initial thoughts with it. 

Upper:
- Knit material feels very premium and stretchy. It’s weird because it definitely fits long but after sizing down by .5, the fit became perfect. Normal width is very accommodating to my semi-wide feet. I was initially skeptical about how uncomfortable the high-ish cut of this sock-bootie upper will be, but it remained comfortable throughout my runs. I don’t care about breathability cause my feet don’t sweat (lol) but this is a very breathable shoe for anyone interested that

 Midsole:
- this is one of the softest midsoles I have ever tried. I’m not even exaggerating. It is in the same ballpark as the New Balance Rebel v2 midsole. The rebel v2 midsole leaned more on the very bouncy and responsive end, which made it a very energetic but unstable shoe. The Neo Zen is a propulsive ride, but leans more towards the sink-in/shock absorbing kind of soft. I don’t consider this mushy as I still get a ton of propulsion from the midsole. The midsole is a lot more stable compared to the rebel v2. I like to attribute it to the fact that the base is noticeably wide. 

Outsole:
- virtually the same as the Mizuno Neo Vista. Gripped well on cement/pavement, and even though it’s still early, I think this will be very durable. As mentioned previously, the Neo Zen has a wide base that greatly adds to the stability of this very soft shoe.

Other comments:
- it’s funny cause I think Mizuno was spot on in saying in their website that this shoe is not a speed shoe but also not an easy day shoe. It lands somewhere in between. The Neo Zen doesn’t have an aggressive rocker, but the midsole is very soft and propulsive that it makes you want to go faster when running. However, when you get past Threshold pace and approach repeats pace/5km pace, the lack of stability and snappiness that is usually provided by plates now becomes apparent. Running at a comfortably fast pace in this shoe does seem like the sweet spot.

Moving forward, I would be using this shoe for longer training runs that are faster than easy pace. So basically marathon paced runs. It lacks the responsiveness I need for runs faster than Threshold pace and too energetic for runs on easy pace. Hopefully this feeling lasts until 500km+ because running in this shoe has been a very enjoyable experience so far",2025-02-05 18:11:37+00:00,201,82
1iif27a,RunningShoeGeeks,Reebok FloatZig 1,"I randomly saw some threads here before recommending these shoes and I found out they are cheaper compared to other daily trainers on the market. I found a pair at €70 and decided to give them a try because their retro look fits perfectly as walking sneakers in case they didn’t amaze me. Unfortunately I am wrong because they’re going to be both daily trainers and fashion sneakers after my first run!

https://preview.redd.it/fbgjutp4sche1.png?width=2602&format=png&auto=webp&s=a34fc7fc41abc1fd626123c8c257a0de3db8e68c

# Fast facts

* User profile: M, 180cm, 70kg
* Shoe size: 28.5cm in all brands; EU44 in Reebok
* Average weekly mileage: 60-80km
* Running style: neutral; fore and mid-foot striker
* Run used: 11-mile daily run (\~5:40-6:00/km)
* Terrain ran: dry road (concrete, asphalt, cobblestone)

# Thoughts

The first thing I noticed was the thick plastic-y upper that felt less premium than other daily trainers on the market with their full felt and mesh materials but this is to be expected from a shoe of this price point. It doesn’t bother me at all but it is one of the most prominent features of the shoes.

# Size and fit

As in all running shoes I choose 28.5cm inclusive of the one thumb forefoot space to account for foot swelling. The FloatZig 1’s forefoot width is neither roomy nor narrow - it is just perfect for my foot shape and the same goes for the middle.

The shoe runs a bit long but it didn’t bother me during the run. The extra heel space was noticeable but I think a runner’s knot will remedy this. Unfortunately I was wearing heel patches because they’re both raw from Doc Martens the other day hence the loose heel I chose to run in. Overall the heel did not slip at one point so that wasn’t a problem for me.

# Ride

I tried these for an 11-mile daily run on concrete, cobblestones and dry forest paths.

At around 280g, I was expecting these to feel like flat bricks like the Brooks Ghosts and Nike Pegasus lines but no! These are comparable to Asics Novablasts in my opinion in terms of comfort in spite of their weight.

These doesn’t have a rocker shape but I didn’t experience any difficulty moving to my natural fore/mid-foot striking.

I really like the midsole - it wasn’t responsive and not that bouncy (which I usually prefer i.e. Asics Novablast 3) but it wasn’t lifeless like Puma Velocity Nitro 2 and Adidas Adizero SL. I prefer this shoe over the last two over any day! It is also wide and chunky that I found a bit supportive but I wouldn’t call it neutral-stable because I still felt some imbalances while running on cobblestone paths. This might be a deal break for others who need more stability in their shoes.

# Performance

I only used them up to my Zone 3 today and I can say that they didn’t feel heavy. It was easy to change paces between recovery to aerobic without any trouble.

I usually average at around 175 cadence in my other lighter shoes and I found out that I did it with these shoes as well. I believe it was the lightness and comfort I felt from them that didn’t hinder my natural running.

Unfortunately I wasn’t able to sped up below 5:00/km but I suspect these can handle those paces with some effort.

# Durability

The outsole is definitely above average. It is not the famed Puma Grip but it is better and thicker than Asics’ for sure.

After 11 miles the shoes still look brand new and I will continue to observe for the next 100 miles or so.

# Overall

I was truly impressed at what they were able to provide in terms of cushioning at their price point. Initially I wanted them because of the wide range of attractive colourways and now they found a slot as a recovery and daily trainers in my rotation. The reviews from redditors didn’t let me down this time compared to Adidas Adizero SL which I regret purchasing.

If these were a bit responsive, more bouncy and had a slight rocker shape, then these would replace my Asics Novablast 3s!

# Next steps

I will continue using them for recovery and daily runs to test that comfortable midsole and the long-term durability of the outsole. I might do long runs (more than 10 miles) with them that I think they will be able to handle.",2025-02-05 17:11:02+00:00,35,21

1ii5fau,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Cielo X1 2.0 First Run,"About me:
Male - 5'11 - 81kg - 100km per week
5km: 19:59
10km: 42:30
HM: 1:35
Max HR: 196
Training for first marathon. 
Heel/mid-foot striker - cadence runner ~160spm @easy and ~180spm @HM pace

Preamble: This was my most anticipated shoe release of the year. The Cielo X1 is my favourite shoe ever. It's a brilliant stable trainer, but it is too heavy for raceday imo. A local sports store had the 2.0 in early and I had to pull the trigger. I'd watched Mike from The Run Testers' first run review, which made me temper my expectations. 

Fit: I sized up a half. Normally I wear 9, but for both the Cielo X1 and 2.0, I wear a 9.5. that's the size I use for my race shoes (AF3, AP3, SC Elite V3). The toe box is wide enough, but a bit shallower than the X1. 

Upper: Completely redesigned. It's a very thin, transparent plasticy material with some fabric. Really breathable and I had absolutely no issues getting a good lockdown, and experienced no discomfort from the upper. I never had any issues.with the original upper or laces either. 

Outsole: Reduction in rubber coverage in the mid-foot, leaving exposed foam. Noticeably reduced and narrowed heel bevel. This shoe is not heel striker friendly like the first. The forefoot is basically unchanged. It's quite thick rubber where it is placed and the traction was perfect, except on the wet cobbles, where I spun my wheels. I've not found that many shoes that do slick cobbles well though. The cutout has changed side, and I hate it. The first caused no issues and felt really stable. The cutout moving to the inside of the foot makes the shoe really unstable. There is significant inward collapse due to the position of that cutout. The little knob of foam that is left there is like a loose tooth. It freely wiggles when pinched.

Midsole: This foam is really soft. It's less dense than the original with noticable squish. You still have that really crazy pogo feeling right in the middle region, but it does press into the arch of my foot significantly. If you have flat feet, I can see this being a big issue. I have very high arches, luckily, so it wasn't a problem. The rocker is aggressive. Almost unnatural in the way it goes from pogo stick midfoot to toe off. It feels very awkward to walk in. 

The ride: So I had a 30km long run today with some pace variations. I did 6km WU in the Superblast 2 and a 4km Cool down in them. The remaining 20km, I wore the 2.0. I started the 2.0 with 6km @4:50/km. And I didn't love it. It felt wobbly and I was really having to work to hit that pace. The X1 felt effortless to cruise in here. Following the 6km @4:50, I had 5km steady @5:15. The shoe felt fine floating here, but I always felt like I was running on a bouncy handball because it literally feels like a handball is directly under your arch, and the rest of the shoe is just balancing on that (think circus elephant balancing on ball). After the 5km steady, I had 6km @4:30/km. The shoe felt better here. That aggressive geometry really kept my feet rolling through nicely. At times I did notice my pace slackening though, so I obviously wasn't locking it in as easily as it felt. But my max HR is 196, and I never went above 176 in this run, so the shoe was clearly quite efficient. Because of the rain, my feet were wet and they slipped on the insoles of these shoes excessively. Despite a good lock down, my toes did blister up, I suspect because I was sliding into the front of the shoe so often. The shoes are also the loudest, squeakiest shoe I've ever worn. They are LOUD. 

Shoe weight: 215 grams in a US 9.5

Verdict: I need to give them another run when it's dry. I think they are okay, but they don't wow me like the original. They feel like they might be great aggressive Half Marathon shoes, but I doubt I'd want to take them to a full. YMMV",2025-02-05 08:19:16+00:00,114,46

1ihw1pm,RunningShoeGeeks,Adidas Evo SL,"Got an alert these dropped in the adidas app and I’ve heard so much about them I wanted to test them out. First off the color is better in person. Love ‘em. A few weeks ago I got the zoom fly 6 and heard these are similar so wanted to try them. Here are my few thoughts on them after my first run in them. It was a 3x9 min threshold session so I put them through their paces. 

Fit: true to size but maybe a tad long (?). Roomy toe box which is nice in the winter so I can wear warmer socks without worrying about them being too tight. 

First step: nice and soft. Really nice feel. Good upper and padding. 

First run: similar to adios pro 3 they aren’t super soft initially and really hope they soften up the the ap3. The shoe is fun to run in. Decent snap and light weight so make for a great tempo shoe. If the light strike softens like the ap3 these will be a great long run/workout/easy run shoe. If it doesn’t soften up it’ll still be a good workout shoe but don’t think I’d take them on easy runs but might test them on some long runs. 

Comparison to ZF6: right now ZF6 would be a better long run shoe but for me I have gotten some discomfort with them on runs over an hour but haven’t done too many miles in them so still can turn around. But if I had to choose after one run I think I’d pick these but can’t go wrong. 

Other shoes in rotation: Alphafly 1/3, vaporfly 2, invincible 3, ap3, primex strung, sc elite 3, and velocity nitro. ",2025-02-04 23:36:40+00:00,492,130

1ihmi7w,RunningShoeGeeks,Mizuno Neo Zen first run impressions,"So... These are absolutely amazing. I don't remember having this much fun while running. 

GOOD FOR HEAVY RUNNERS: 
Due to my height I'm on more heavy side 83kg (182lbs) and was afraid if these could be too squishy, but once I started run it was all great. 

FIT: 
I've heard many people recommend to go half size down, but I got mine TTS and they fit great. I always go for size 44 (10.5 US) with Mizuno shoes and I'm glad I did this time as well. I like pretty loose fit and I barely tighten my shoe laces on ""normal"" shoes. That sock type upper is pretty loose in the fingers part of the shoe but it snags the rest quite well. On the tong and close to ankle parts outsole is very stretchy so for someone that like it loose I still liked it. 

STABILITY: 
They're absolutely not recommended for someone that needs stability shoes as foam is very, very squishy. I also wouldn't recommend them to someone, who just started running, as you need some strength in the ankles and lower parts of your legs, due to lack of stability. 

RUNNING EXPERIENCE: 
I've heard these can be great for easy and even slower paced runs, but boy, once you make first steps, you just want to go faster and faster. At one point I realized that I didn't check my watch a single time to check the pace as I was having this much fun that I didn't care. I didn't have this much fun running in a long time. I even tried some strides at the end and went crazy and they did a great job holding up to the pace. I'm not sure if the experience will be the same for lighter runners when it comes to faster paces.

PRICE: In my country I got those for something a little bit over 140USD and it's just a bargain.",2025-02-04 17:03:11+00:00,180,75

1ighw3f,RunningShoeGeeks,Torin 8 First Run and Comparison to 7,"TLDR: Compared to 7, 8 is more stable, slightly firmer, slightly more rockered, does not have ankle rubbing, but still has a low height toebox.

The Torin 7 was a shoe that seemed fine on paper but ultimately did not work out for me due to an accumulation of small issues.  The Torin 8 is what seems at first to be only an iterative update on the 7 but all together feels like a much more refined experience.

A huge issue that quite a many Torin 7 owners have complained about was the ankle rubbing due to the extremely stiff heel collar.  I had some (albeit only minor) heel rubbing on the 7, and I'm happy to report that I don't have that sensation at all on the 8.

The other big issue I had on the 7 was the extremely low height toebox (this has been corroborated objectively by RunRepeat), also accompanied by a very stiff upper that does not stretch.  Unfortunately, the upper is only a bit more accommodating (still relatively stiff) and the height in the toebox is still quite low in the Torin 8.  This time around, I decided to go a half size up on the 8, which has helped with this somewhat and made it bearable at least for me (the part of the upper near the rigid toe guard is much less stretchy, so sitting further for the toe guard helps).  The downside to this is the shoe now being long (I'm a thumb and a half from the end now, though only one thumb width from the rigid toe guard).

A major change the 8 has made is prioritizing stability.  They added a notable medial sidewall and also filled in the midfoot a bit more (can see in pictures).  The sidewall is not intrusive even to someone like myself with extremely flat feet (and is often bothered by sidewalls as a result), probably in large part because of the wide fit throughout the shoe.  In another nod to stability, the Torin 8 has brought a full rigid heel counter, in comparison to the 7's heel counter that was only rigid in a small central part.  Nonetheless, I still consider the Achilles area of the Torin 8 to be far more comfortable than the Torin 7 because the upper is no longer extremely stiff in this area (which also caused Achilles discomfort in addition to ankle rubbing).

The ride of the Torin 8 has had several tweaks from the 7 that are all only slight on their own but add up to a noticably new experience.  A change I really like is adding a bit more of a rocker (but still only slightly).  Altra added a small heel sole flare and heel bevel, adding just a bit of a rockered feeling (the picture I used is kind of a bad angle and makes it look like the 8 has less of a toe spring than the 7, which is not actually true: both have the same amount of toe spring).  The lack of a noticable rocker made the Torin 7 a ""harsher"" experience of zero drop to me (i.e. requiring *lots* of effort from the intrinsic foot muscles), so I'm glad for this change.  The Torin 7 I found to have an very high level of bending stiffness (not sure how this was the case with a relatively lower stack and tons of flex grooves).  The Torin 8 is still rigid, but I think it's a bit less so (the new flex groove design could be playing a part here).  Finally, I was surprised (with the whole industry going the other way) to perceive a firmer midsole on the Torin 8 than 7.  I could be speaking too soon here because the Torin 7 did have a break-in period for me, but a denser foam is supported by a slight increase in weight on the 8.  I generally prefer slightly firm shoes but I think the Ego Max on the 7 achieved a very nice balance between cushioning and firmness.  Still though, the 8 is definitely not extremely firm and is in the acceptable range for foams I'm comfortable with.

The outsole has changed (see picture) and I can't comment on its performance as I've only taken in on the treadmill.  I will say though I'm bit concerned by the decision to replace some of the rubber coverage with rubberized foam (?) especially given Altra's questionable track record in stability as of late.

Overall, the Torin 8 doesn't seem that different than the 7 at first glance, but a large collection of positive small tweaks has me very hopeful that this version will work better for me than the 8.  The one potential improvement Altra missed out on though is increasing the toebox height.",2025-02-03 05:25:24+00:00,85,28
1igcnpo,RunningShoeGeeks,An analysis of Pareto-optimal running shoes,"tldr: I created a list of Pareto-optimal running shoes using 3 criteria (weight, stack height, and MSRP). Skip down to the bottom for the lists.

Long version: The concept of ""[Pareto efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency)"" comes from economics but has been applied to other fields.  For example, a few years ago 538 wrote [a very popular article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/explaining-james-hardens-monster-game-with-a-century-old-economic-theory/) about Pareto optimal basketball games.  The basic concept is that something is Pareto optimal if there is no better alternative without some sort of trade-off. 

For running shoes, the 3 most obvious criteria are weight, stack height, and price.  Obviously there are other factors (stability, springiness, durability, etc.) but these are more difficult to quantify objectively.

Some details on methodology:

* For weight, we use measurements of a men's size 9 based on the ""cut in half"" analysis from [RunRepeat](https://runrepeat.com/).  I think this is more consistent than using manufacturer specs.
* For stack height we again use the RunRepeat database. We use heel stack height as a simplification but since most shoes on the list tend to have similar drops (6-10mm) I doubt it would have changed much to use some average of heel & forefoot.
* For price I used MSRP. Of course some brands tend to inflate MSRP and offer frequent discounts but factoring this in gets too complicated.
* I separated out plated/rodded and non-plated/rodded shoes into two different lists. I think we all know that plated shoes tend to have a very different feel so I think this makes sense.
* I tried to include most current models from the popular brands. I excluded stability shoes but I doubt they would look good with this sort of analysis. I excluded most budget trainers, which nobody should be buying anyway. 
* The Evo One is a special case.  RunRepeat has not done a ""cut-in-half"" analysis of this shoe but it's too big of an elephant in the room to leave off entirely. As a compromise I decided to include it. Analysis of other Adidas racing shoes indicates that the manufacturer spec for weight tends to be quite accurate but heel stack is over-estimated by a few mm.  So I decided to use the quoted weight for the Evo One (138 g) but penalize it 2 mm for stack height (37 mm instead of 39 mm).

Without further ado, there are the lists (sorted by heel stack):

**Pareto-Optimal Non-Plated Running Shoes**

|Shoe|Heel stack|Weight|MSRP|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Superblast 2|42.8 mm|252 g|$200|
|Fresh Foam X More v5|42.1 mm|308 g|$155|
|Novablast 5|40.9 mm|254 g|$140|
|Fresh Foam X Balos|37.8 mm|247 g|$200|
|EVO SL|36.1 mm|223 g|$150|
|SL2|34.9 mm|245 g|$130|
|Noosa Tri 16|32.8 mm|217 g|$135|
|Kinvara 15|27.9 mm|194 g|$120|

Many of the shoes you would expect are on this list, like the Superblast 2, Novablast 5, EVO SL, and SL2, since these are probably the most frequently recommended on /r/runningshoegeeks. I was somewhat surprised to also see two entries from New Balance on the list but I can understand why they are not more popular. The FF X More v5 is $45 cheaper than the Superblast 2 for nearly the same stack height, but substantially heavier.  The FF X Balos is slightly lighter than the Novablast 5, but $50 more expensive and 3 mm lower stack height. The Noosa Tri 16 also barely makes it on the list by being slightly lighter & cheaper than the EVO SL, but with significantly reduced stack height.  The final 2 entries trade off stack height for low weight; not great for road running but good if you do lots of track work. 

On to the plated shoes:

**Pareto-Optimal Plated Running Shoes**

|Shoe|Heel stack|Weight|MSRP|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Skyward X|46.3 mm|315 g|$225|
|Prime X 2 Strung|45.7 mm|305 g|$300|
|Mach X 2|44.6 mm|247 g|$190|
|Magic Speed 4|42.5 mm|237 g|$170|
|Endorphin Elite|39.9 mm|203 g|$275|
|Metaspeed Sky Paris|39.1 mm|183 g|$250|
|Deviate Nitro 3|37.4 mm|268 g|$160|
|Evo One|37 mm|138 g|$500|
|ZoomX Streakfly|31.7 mm|171 g|$160|

There's actually 4 different ""chonky boiz"" (>40 mm stack height) that make the list, all of which are different trade-offs between stack height, weight & cost. The Mach X 2 seems like the best balance of the 3 personally but I've never run in any of them. In the legal racing shoe category, the Metaspeed Sky Paris absolutely crushes the competition, except for (a) the Endorphin Elite with a slightly higher stack and (b) the Evo One. I was pretty surprised to find the Alphafly 3 missing from the list but the Metaspeed Sky Paris higher stack, lighter, and cheaper.  If the MSP didn't exist, the AP3 would be Pareto-optimal, but just barely, by being 2 g lighter than the Endorphin Elite. For budget racers, Deviate Nitro 3 is your best option for high stack height and ZoomX Streakfly for being lightweight.

**What about shoe deals?**

Price is a tricky thing.  In theory this analysis needs to be repeated given the current lowest sale price of every shoe.  As a simple rule of thumb, you can use the data above to check whether a particular shoe deal makes sense from a Pareto optimization standpoint.  Simply reference the charts linked below. For example, the Novablast 4 (39.2 mm, 259 g) can currently be found widely for $110. Assuming every other shoe on the list can only be found at MSRP, this puts into into Pareto-optimum territory.

1ifkhsw,RunningShoeGeeks,Li-Ning Feidian Elite 4,"The new series 5 is available in the Li-ning Feidian series (challenger, elite, ultra), so I was able to purchase this series 4 feidian elite at a deep discount. I managed to get the shoe delivered to Aus for a total of $143 AUD ($89 USD) so I decided it was worth a shot.    

Firstly, I love this banana yellow colour. Not enough running shoes are yellow in my opinion. I think it looks great and it really pops!   

I'm usually a US8 but as long as I stick the 260mm im usually OK. 260mm was a US8.5 in Li-ning which fits perfectly.    

The upper is a mesh which feels similar to the Adios Pro 3 but without the harsh fit. The tongue is a stretchy knitted mesh sock which is very comfortable and provided a snug fit. I was surprised to see that there is no additional top lace hole for a runners loop, but the fit was good and I didn't have any issues with slippage.    

The midsole which is supposedly PEBA is very firm to the touch but while still firm it is forgiving once on the foot.
When running, the midsole is still firm and reminds me of the slight sink and fast rebound of the current Puma ATPU soles but slightly firmer. This provides great energy return and fantastic stability in what is a light shoe at 210g for my US 8.5.   

I took these for a 10km run at easy pace (5.30km) and they felt great. Responsive and stable. I could feel that they would pick up the pace well when i pushed a bit but was reluctant to do too much due to some ongoing calf niggles.
There is a prominent drop that pushes you forward once you go past 45 degrees on the forefoot. It's visibly almost like a lump you can see on the outsole.    

The firmness did start to impact comfort toward the end of the run and I wouldn't want to take this to marathon distance. Hopefully the midsole breaks in a bit and I think it's a very capable 5km to half marathon shoe which will also happily be a training workhorse. The CPU outsole and firm midsole combination should ensure you get plenty of miles out of the shoe. Not sure that I'd pay full price for this model which is over $300 AUD, but for the price I paid, this shoe is a bargain.    

This is my first Li-ning shoe and it has definitely piqued my interest. The Feidian 5 has a lower density midsole which should make it softer so I'm really looking forward to trying the series down the track.

1if4act,RunningShoeGeeks,Xtep 260x a Hobby Joggers Review,"
Disclaimer: I acknowledge that this is an international subreddit and I made this post for the Philippine audience, so some statements may not hold true especially in countries where there is a strong running culture. I would still however like to share my thoughts despite knowing that situation. 


TLDR: Very bad for 8:00/km+, good for 7:00/km, amazing for sub 5:00/km

Testing Methodology

It has almost been 3 months since my last post and received Xtep260x as my race day/speed workout shoes. Since then I ran all my speed workouts, and race pace efforts in these shoes. I also added a few, easy long 90min runs just to know what it feels like at my Z2 pace of 7:00-7:30/km. I have run an accumulated 80kms in this pair and it’s still performing the same as Day 1.

Personal Background

I am not a professional runner or reviewer by any means much like many of us in the sub. However, I am a connoisseur of Chinese branded products for my hobbies. So when Xtep 260x was in my radar, I bought it at its cheapest historical price. I was initially debating whether to get the 360x, 260x or the 361 Flame series, but after seeing this [video and so much time spent translatin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOQBGRXZ11U)g, I got the 260x.

Sizing and On Feet Feel

I got size 41 which is my TTS based on my previous Nike Pegasus 39 and 40 shoes. The first thing that I noticed was a VERY generous toe box, its feels quite loose but in a good way as I can actually wiggle my toes around. The upper is also a breathable mesh that provides a good airflow during the steamy fast sessions. During my first run I could definitely feel the carbon plate beneath my feet and its curved nature. The increased height from the ground contact point was also an interesting feeling to say the least.

Performance

I could really only compare 260x to my previous daily trainers of Nike Pegasus 39, 40 and my Deviate Nitro v1 which was the first iteration of Puma’s race shoe with Nitro technology. Needless to say, this is miles better than my daily trainers for fast sessions. Using my Pegasi, I develop hotspots at sub 5:00/km pace especially during repeated efforts. I did not feel any of these using 260x. Compared to the DNv1, the generous toebox gave enough room for my feet to expand and breathable upper keeps my feet cool which are problems that I encountered with the Puma. I honestly couldn’t remember more of how the Puma feels like because all the time I was wearing that, it felt tight. And no, sizing up wouldn’t be of help either since it would already be too long. Another thing that I noticed using 260x is lower sustained heart rate during my Z2 runs. At 7:00km/pace my sustained heart rate is usually sits around 150-160bpm, (I know it seems a bit high, but as a 50kg, mid 20s male, trust me, that’s my z2 pace). With these I don’t hit above 150 before 1hr mark with cardiac rift involved which was very surprising. At race pace however is where this really shines. I managed to hit a sub 25k PB back in a December race during my first use (previously it was at 25:01) and just a few hours ago (attached photo), during a fast community fun run (with a possible 23min goal in sight). The coaches and the pack even told me that I was quite relaxed while we were running with my heart rate was sitting at an average of 189bpm for the entire 5k. I could even manage to talk in a somewhat conversational pace. I guess I wasn’t expanding much energy during that effort. After all that praise, let me tell you that this is horrible during recovery efforts where you are essentially speed walking. It doesn’t even feel good while walking because you can feel the carbon plate pushing you forward. Some people may like that sensation but not me. if you’re running races at 8:00/km, get a daily trainer like the Adizero SL2 or Anta PG 7 instead. Or something else nonplated. This will give you a hard time.

Conclusion

Many of the people here in the sub me included are hobby joggers and not race runners. And that is perfectly okay, people run for various reasons, may it be of health, community, or pure fun alone. This is an obvious elitist take but IN MY OPINION, until you can hit a sustained Sub30-5km in your daily trainers, you do NOT need a carbon plated race day shoe. You are nowhere near competitive with a 5k slower than 30minutes anyway. Your Downshifter, Revolution, Duramo Speed, or even ukay shoes that you’re currently running in is more than enough to get you started and carry you far in your running journey. If you are currently run-walking and want to have better comfort, you can invest in shoes with better midsole technology like Cliftons, Novablasts or even the new Pegasus 41, but you don’t need a carbon plated shoe. Sure, if you have the money to burn, for Php3000 you can buy this to try it out since its cheaper than mainstream brands. But you really won’t be able to make the most out of the performance that this shoe provides.

PS: I believe that the 260x line up is best for 5k up to the sub2hr half marathon distance. I think it will fall short for a sub4 or feel worse for a slower marathon pace. But that’s the next review in a few more months’ time.

1if0r13,RunningShoeGeeks,Takumi Sen 10 review,"US Size 9.5 men’s — 5’7(.5) (174 cm) and 125 lbs (57 kg)

For context I am a high school junior competing in the United States. I run cross country in the fall and track in the spring. I wore these shoes in my state championship where I placed in the top 25. I got these shoes because I enjoy a low drop experience and wanted a modernized version of a racing flat. 

The upper/sizing: The upper is very light weight and comfortable. Where I live it is very hot and humid, so how breathable the upper is made a really big impression on me. The shoe definitely runs a little small, as I am between a 9 and 9.5 U.S men’s, and this 9.5 still had a really snug race day feel. The heel offers little to no structure, and for me a runners loop is completely necessary for this shoe to function at its peak. Without one, my ankles felt loose in the shoe when going around tight corners. Adidas sent another huge swing and a miss the the laces, which I ended up replacing. I had no complaints about the tongue


Midsole: The midsole on this shoe is substantially lower than you see in a lot of shoes now, with only about 33 mm of foam in the heel. The foam felt significantly more firm than other super foams, like Zoomx, to me. In my opinion this really benefited the shoe because it keeps it snappy and turnover high. The energy rods in the Takumi are bouncy and give a lot of spring. It felt like when I was on concrete or asphalt, a midfoot strike would hit all of the rods and provide excellent energy return. This shoe is NOT for heel strikers. The transition from heel to forefoot is clunky, and the energy rods don’t really provide much off of a heel strike. 

Outsole: I have put almost 60 miles on these and the outsole shoes little wear and tear. The continental rubber patch provides really good traction, even in the rain for me, while the heel shows minor signs of use. From what I can tell it’s all cosmetic. 

Summary: the Takumi Sen 10 is a really fast shoe that works for almost everything I’ve thrown at it. It handles races, thresholds, and track workouts really well and provides excellent spring and speed at a super light weight. These shoes feel feather light but offer good ground feel and solid energy return.

1iek1uc,RunningShoeGeeks,Adidas Adios Pro 4 review and some Y3 AP4 pics,"Had my standard pair of Adios Pro 4 for about 2 weeks now. I am 42M 83kg 173cm 5K 21:58 HM1:43 Done 3 runs - 50k together and really like them so far. Run my 4 hm races in AP3 and like the shoe but that was my only super shoe really as only running for about a year. AP4 much softer and completely different under foot and drive. 

1st run 8km 1k intervals z2 at 5:45 and every other run progressively faster from my MP/HM/10k/5K pace  5:15/4:50/4:35/4:20. Really surprised by how soft the shoe was comparing to AP3, but fit and feel is absolutely miles away from AP3 - so much more comfortable- that upper is just perfect. Soft from beginning but did get better with pace. Really great energy return. 

2nd warm up / cool down and then run 8x1minute at 3:45 in the middle. Done in cold with bit of icing on the road - shoe felt very good. Bit firmer at that speed - was thinking it could be cold at 1-2degrees affecting the foam but not sure right now.

3rd run 24km long run at 5:45. Good even at the slower paces and very comfortable. Run east morning around 1-2 degrees in mixed conditions - road/some frost/grass/gravel and even ice- grip was absolutely brilliant. Ride very good and best of all my legs felt very fresh after the run. 

So as You can say I really like the shoe. Will run half marathon race end of march so-cannot wait. Comparing to AP3 it is a different shoe all together. I have run around 1500km between multiple pairs of AP3 last year - used mainly for races and faster pace runs, but also some Z2 longer runs as shoe feel stable. But it is very hard to go to that AP3 upper now. Does always bother me after wearing AP4 (or any other shoe to be honest. AP4 feels like luxurious daily compared to AP3. I was bit worried that I will have stability issues with AP4 (done few runs in Ap2 and PrimeX which I did not really enjoy) but AP4 it’s pretty stable for me.

Received Y3 version today as there is good deal at the moment at Cettire website - cost me just over £200 shipped with all the taxes to UK so cheaper than standard pair available here. For those who always questioning if Y3 is any different I would say No, although both in same size UK10/US10.5 Y-3 weight slightly more. But not quite sure where the weight is.(could be gram here ther eon paint/label or just manufacturers difference) Y-3 version looks beautiful though. That color combo is so nice and luxurious. Highly recommended. Would make great summer shoe once it does retire from running (and If my ankles can handle it) Also Y3  comes with extra pair of laces - light beige. Took pictures with both of them.

1id7pz4,RunningShoeGeeks,Adidas EVO SL Review From Something With Wide Feet,"https://preview.redd.it/c7qi37icn0ge1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=699c13bd320e4261e62cdda89eba4e0598e333f5

A bit about me: 5'7"" (170 cm), 150 lbs (68 kg). My marathon pace is around 6:33/mi (4:04/km), and my easy pace is 8:30-9:30/mi (5:20-5:50/km). I have low arches, and my right foot is about 2E wide, while my left foot is more normal in width.

I was lucky to get a pair of these shoes when they were briefly available online in the US around December 1st. I’ve run 50 miles in them so far, including easy runs, threshold mile repeats at the track, and half marathon pace tempos. I haven’t taken them on a long run yet, with the longest run being 10 miles.

**FIT**  
Mine are size US 9.5. I wear the same size in most other shoes: AP3, Endorphin Pro 3, Rebels, Triumph 20, and Endorphin Speed 2. Compared to the AP3, the EVO SLs are much wider in the forefoot and midfoot, providing plenty of room for my wider right foot. I don’t have to resort to the hack I use with the AP3, which involves keeping the midfoot laces loose and then using a tight runner’s knot to prevent my foot from sliding forward. If you have very narrow feet, you might not like these.

I’ve also tried the AP4s, and the left arch area of the shoe is high enough to cause significant discomfort (I didn’t have this issue at all with the AP3). I liked everything else about the AP4 except for that. I couldn’t imagine running for 5 minutes with that pain, let alone an entire marathon. Luckily, the EVO SL doesn’t have this problem for me.

**UPPER**  
The upper is fantastic. I can tighten the laces without it feeling constricting. Compared to the terrible plastic-like upper of the AP3, the EVO SL’s upper conforms to my feet much better. There’s no heel slippage at all, and I don’t have to fiddle with the shoes during runs to make them comfortable/bearable.

The laces are ok. While I wish they were wider and more elastic, they are better than the AP3 ones and don't cause any issues.

The weak point is the tongue. It tends to fold up on the sides when you put on the shoe so you might have to spend a bit of time sorting it out. It does stay in place during runs. They are on the short side but still long enough to cover the knot even when using runners knot.

**MIDSOLE**  
The midsole is exactly how I hoped it would be when I first heard about these shoes. I love the AP3’s midsole, and it’s my race day shoe despite its terrible upper. The EVO SL’s ride and feel are similar. The heel area feels the same, while the forefoot area is probably a little softer (maybe due to the lack of a plate) and slightly bouncier. However, the rocker feels less aggressive. With the AP3, I feel like I’m running slightly downhill, but I don’t get that sensation with the EVO SL. You still get that dense yet soft (but not too soft) feeling of Lightstrike Pro when you land, followed by great energy return. The less aggressive rocker also makes the shoe suitable for easy paces, whereas the AP3 felt awkward at slower speeds. The EVO SL feels great at faster paces, and I found it stable enough for track workouts.

Some other runners have felt that the foam was too firm, but that hasn’t been my experience.

**FINAL THOUGHTS**  
I think I’ve found my workout shoes for the next couple of years. They’re light, have a simple and comfortable upper that works well for my wide feet, perform great at different paces, and are very reasonably priced at USD 150. Based on the durability of the AP3, I expect these to hold up well too. I’ll definitely be buying more pairs when they become available again.

1ict6y4,RunningShoeGeeks,Superblast 2 First Run Impressions,"About me: 
30yo Male
177cm
81kg
Heel/mid-foot striker 
100 KMs per week
Cadence ~165-175
US9
Max HR: 197

Easy pace: 5:25-6:25/km
Marathon pace: 4:45/km
HMP: 4:30/km
10km: 4:22/km
5km: 3:59/km

First Run: I'm in a deload week right now. Took these for a 12km long run, and did a 5km progression to see if these will be suitable for long runs with MP blocks. I was running on a dead straight path, with some very minor inclines and a mostly downhill return. The shoes, while huge and obvious on foot, move through the paces very comfortable. While my HR was creeping into tempo and thresh ranges, it still felt sustainable and efficient.

Sizing: These fit true to size. They are more narrow than the Novablast 5, but still plenty of room in the toebox. They feel slightly more dialled in than the original SB. 

Upper: Didn't have any issues with breathability. It was 31°c where I'm from in Aus today. The ventilation in the mesh is welcome, and overall the structure feels more natural than the plqsticy upper of the first SB. 

Outsole: I really like that they have indented the exposed foam sections on the outsole, because on the SB1, I tore that up. Now it seems like the rubber outsole is the only part contacting the ground, which should be even better for durability. I ran on a fully paved path so there was no test for the grip. 

Midsole: Genuinely surprised here. I fully expected a near identical feeling to the original. BUT, there is a very obvious plushness and bounce that wasn't present in the first. I put that down to the superior foam. The heel toe transition feels smoother and the midsole is bouncy and responsive straight out of the box. Otherwise, it is a very, very similar ride to the original. I don't think you need to upgrade from the first, but it definitely feels better at my faster paces.

1ic97h9,RunningShoeGeeks,Topo Athletic Trail and Road Shoes,"Hope this is the proper place to post this review(and minor question). Be great if anyone else with experiences of Topo Athletic shoes(particularly road models) could mention how fit/sizing was for them.

# TLDR

Topo Athletic sizing consistent among trail runners(for fitting length/width), nuances in actual width along entire shoe. Road shoe sizing seems a bit narrower(ST-5 SIZE UP), and drastically different from trail runners. Trail runners using Vibram Megagrip outsoles have fanastic grip/traction. Uppers/midsoles/outsole pretty good overall.

**Does anyone have Topo Athletic Magnifly 5/Fly-Lyte 5(or previous versions), should I size up half a size? And people who own ST-5, did any of you size up half or full size?**

# INTRO

Currently I own several models of Topo Athletic trail runners and road shoes.

What I have(**THIS IS ALSO IN ORDER OF WIDEST FIT TO NARROWEST**) : 

1. MTN Racer 3 (TRAIL)
2. Terraventure 4 (TRAIL)
3. Traverse(Wide size) (TRAIL)
4. Cyclone (ROAD)
5. ST-5 (ROAD)

I came from running in mainly Saucony, Hoka, Salomon. I eventually moved towards lower drop and wide shoes such as Altra and some other brands. I found Topo Athletic as a solution for running shoes that offer some lower/mid cushioned models with low drop(0mm, 3mm, 5mm).

My main goal is finding wide toebox shoes. Perferably firmer cushion with a lower stack. Drop doesn't matter as much, but preferably zero to low.

# SIZING

I sized US 12 Men's for all models. Traverse I got in a wide version as reviews said they run narrow.

# USE/MILAGE

I have used the MTN Racer 3 for over 320km+ of running/hiking, Cyclone for 100km+ of running, Terraventure 4(Trail/Hike) for 36km trail runing, and Traverse(Trail/hike) and ST-5(Daily/Run) for less than 10km each at this time. Most of my shoes I run distances of \~1km-26km, majority of runs between 2km - 10km.

# FIT

Amongst all shoes, volume was good. Would say it is average volume, and my foot has a low-medium instep and low arch. Compared to something like a Lone Peak 9(tested fit in store), they have more volume in the toebox.

TRAIL : Between the three trail runners, there is a noticeable difference in fit. Mainly with the heel lockdown. I would recommend staying true to size, sizing up half size may be viable if you have wide heel, otherwise you risk improving toebox/midfoot and/or width/length but having heel lift. All trail runners have basically same length internally, and it is plenty(0.5-1cm extra TTS).

* **MTN Racer 3**
   * Widest Toebox, Slightly narrower midfoot, and narrow heel.
   * Very secure fit, no issues with pressure.
   * Inner heel fabric tore, perhaps due to my own wear. Repaired with Tenacious Tape.
* **Terraventure 4**
   * Wide Toebox, narrower midfoot, wide heel.
   * Heel lift would occur even with thick socks and lock lacing techniques.
   * Harder to find good lacing that doesn't pinch my instep but also doesn't have heel lift.
* **Traverse**
   * Wide Toebox(Narrowest out of all trail shoes), in a wide size. Slightly narrower midfoot, slightly narrower heel.
      * Width is approximately same/slighly narrower than normal width Terraventure 4.

**ROAD :** Road shoes seem to be really different in fit. Problem is that most stores do not carry the models I want to try on(if any), and there is limited reviews for me to properly gauge which size I should order.

* Cyclone
   * Wide toebox, slightly narrower midfoot, slightly narrower heel.
   * Width is between MTN Racer 3 and Terraventure 4, probably closer to latter.
* ST-5
   * Narrow toebox, same width midfoot, slightly narrower heel.
   * Fit would probably be same as trail shoes if sized up half or full size.
   * Significantly shorter internal length/width, at size 12 the inside of toebox has slight taper which bothers my big toe.

# UPPERS

**TRAIL :** All uppers are practically the same. Very nice flexible mesh that is tight and kind of breathable. I haven't tested the drainage/drying of Traverse and Terraventure. But the MTN Racer 3 faired well in drying/drainage during a long run I did where my feet got soaked several times. Traverse does come with a water resistant/quick drying insole, but I have to see how that compares to the normal insole later on.

Tounges on MTN Racer 3 and Terraventure 4 are nice and padded. Traverse is also padded but a bit shorter. All pretty comfortable.

**ROAD :** Cyclone had a very breathable yet tight upper with not much stretch, but due to its shape and sizing it doesn't cause discomfort. Heel is not padded and thin, but has a more grippy material. ST-5 Upper is nice, not as breathable but stretchier on the main part. Has a stiffer mesh on the lower upper around the toebox. Cyclone tounge thin, but comfortable. ST-5 is lightly padded tounge and comfortable.

# MIDSOLE

**TRAIL :** All midsoles are pretty similar, moderate firmness. MTN Racer 3 was pretty good responsiveness for a shoe that is 28/33 stack and no rock plate. When moving to Terraventure, it has a rock plate and 22/25 stack. It is a bit more rigid but still pretty nice for running. Traverse is 25/30 stack and has a rock plate as well, but also includes stability features which make it noticeably more rigid than the MTN Racer 3 and Terraventure 4. I'd keep the Traverse mainly for hiking use, rather than trail running.

**ROAD :** The Cyclone midsole(23/28) is pretty firm, which I like and find it very responsive. For the short time I have used the ST-5(14/14) I find the midsole is firm, but not as firm as the Cyclone. Both I would probably reserve more for short/faster runs, but the Cyclone I would use for racing(as I only have those two Topos in my road shoe rotation right now). I have used the Cyclone for a half marathon and it was great.

# OUTSOLE

**TRAIL :** All outsoles for these trail runners are the same. Same tread and same vibram megagrip. Super stuff, really good traction and grip on dirt, snow, rocks, asphalt. I am bit more confident on wet rock, but still cautious. I aimed to get only trail runners with the vibram megagrip as it seems pretty reliable in reviews compared to the Vibram XS Trek EVO offered on some less aggressive trail runners.

Additionally as I have worn the MTN Racer 3 for over 320km, It barely has worn down on the lugs and still provides more or less the same amount of grip from the rubber.

**ROAD :** Cyclone and ST-5 both have decent outsoles that grip pretty well on the road. I have ran in dry/wet/snowy conditions and I didn't have any issues with grip. For 100km it seems the Cyclone is barely worn and seem promising for many more hundreds of kilometers.

# WEIGHT

**TRAIL :** All shoes are pretty decent weight all in the 300-400g range. Terraventure 4 and Traverse are only slightly heavier but feel a bit more bottom heavy probably with the added rock plate.

**ROAD :** Cyclone is pretty light, ST-5 is super light.

Weight of one shoe(left) :

* MTN Racer 3 : \~327g
* Terraventure 4 : \~335g
* Traverse : \~350g
* Cyclone : \~262g
* ST-5 : \~221g

1ibbk2v,RunningShoeGeeks,Nike Pegasus Premium first runs,"It’s Pegasus Premium release week and I was able to get these in early thanks to this community and Fleet Feet

Came in Friday, did 4.5 miles easy pace on Saturday then a 12 miler on Sunday, half easy and half at marathon pace 

Profile:
6’ 150lbs Midfoot striker
5k pace: 6:45
10k pace: 7:05
HM Pace: 7:40
Marathon pace: 8:30
Easy pace 9:30


Fit/Upper: 
Fits like a typical Nike. TTS and slightly narrow. If Nikes are typically too narrow for you, you’ll probably have a similar experience in these. 

Feels like a typical training upper with racing ventilation holes. Laces are short, so might need to get longer ones for anyone that uses the runners knots

Ride/Midsole:
If you ever had experience with full length zoom before, you’ll know the deal. There’s nothing else in the market I’ve experience that feels like Zoom. When walking, it’s soft and extra bouncy. When running, it firms up and extra bouncy. The more force you up into the zoom bag, the bouncier it feels. Most of the weight is from the midsole, but I think the amount of bounce makes up for it.

Runs like a neutral shoe and I think it works very well for heel strikers. Feels really smooth transitioning from heel to toe. Doesn’t feel clunky to me at all and doesn’t feel as max stack compared to the Puma MagMax. My last pic compared my long run shoes, SB2s midsole is longer, and MagMax midsole is much wider.

Outsole only has 16 miles in them. Mostly on road, some snow and ice. No wear at all, and based on how the lugs are, going to be hard to tell. Feels like it’ll be pretty durable.

Overall:
Real fun and bouncy. I thought the Puma MagMax was bouncy, these take it a notch higher. Some might find the weight a problem, but if you have ran in other heavy trainers, these won’t feel any heavier. Works great for Easy/Marathon/Half Marathon paces, will probably reach for my Zoom Fly 6 for any faster paces. I’ve really enjoyed the shoe so far, looking forward to putting more miles. 

Going to grab a 2nd pair for casual use and keep these exclusively for running. Probably grab the pink pair for my gf because they are so comfortable",2025-01-27 15:22:23+00:00,587,169

1iawcjg,RunningShoeGeeks,Asics Novablast 5 - first run review,"
First of all, this color is 🔥🔥🔥


This is only my 4th pair of proper running shoes - previously I had the NB 880s, Saucony Triumph 20s and the NB Rebel V3’s. I found the 880s pretty boring to run in and the Triumphs absolutely trashed my legs every run. I think the drop was too much for me. But the rebel V3’s were my favorite shoes and I logged 750kms in them. They just fit me so well and worked so good.

Now the Novablast 5s after a quick 6km run. I’m I usually a wide 9.5 in new balance, but I had to size down 1/2 size and go regular width. A size 9 regular fit my feet like a glove. These are some comfy shoes! I find the toe box to be wide and the upper to be super comfy. They had some nice energy return during the run but didn’t feel unstable at all.

I was concerned about the grip but I had no issues on wet pavement at all. They felt solid and I didn’t lose my grip. Some parts of the road this morning even had some frost in sections and my grip felt secure. 

I did have some arch pain in my right foot, so next run I’ll loosen my laces a bit and see if that helps. It might just be my adjusting from the flat NB rebels.

Overall I’m really looking forward to these shoes and can’t wait for more runs 🏃🏻‍➡️",2025-01-27 01:32:40+00:00,154,84

1ia4235,RunningShoeGeeks,361 Miro Nude first run,"Context: I weigh 65kg, 170cm. Race marathons almost exclusively with my most recent ones averaging about 2 hours 52-55 minutes. 

I have trained and raced in the Adios Pro Evo 1, Adios Pro 3, Alphafly 1s, Metaspeed sky/+/Paris edge, vaporfly 1/2/3. I’m lucky to have experience in many of the top carbons but decided to try out some Chinese ones after seeing a few reviews here and curiosity got the best of me.

The midsole: This thing weighs 105g in a men’s size 9. Fits true to size. I confirmed with their customer service and also measured my pair at 40mm heel and 38mm forefoot at the thickest portions of the foam (I would subtract maybe 1mm on each end for the outsole for a 39r/37f mm stack height measurement). The best comparable I have is a hybrid between a vaporfly 3 and the Adios Pro Evo 1. Better bounce than VF3, but not as dense as APE1. I do not expect these to last more than 50km before the foam performance degrades, but I’ll keep training in these and see if they feel any different.

The outsole and upper: outsoles are super thin like the APE1s so not sure how long these will last. The upper is almost a replica of the APE1 with super thin and annoying to flatten tongue, but once is place, feels invisible. The upper has a shimmer to it in certain angles which is a pretty cool effect. One thing that kept this shoes weight down is that it does not have a footbed insert - at first I thought the factory had somehow forgotten to include them on my pair, but after running in them I think it makes no difference and is likely how it’s supposed to be.

First run: I was flying in them on my 10 mile tempo run just due to the fast turnover and incredible bounce. I had to intentionally slow my turnover to keep from going into 10k pace. Not sure if this is PEBA or TPE.

I paid $160 for them on sale on Ali which makes it all the more amazing. Will be trying them out as a potential race choice for my next marathon.",2025-01-26 02:46:36+00:00,282,44
1i9z9z1,RunningShoeGeeks,Brooks Glycerin 22 - first run,"Stalled a bit this morning to wait for FedEx and am so glad I did. I've had several pairs of Glycerin 21 and was looking forward to this release.

Shoe fit perfectly in my usual women's 9.5. I have a wider side of normal width foot, which makes shoes like the Hyperion 2/Hyperion Max 2 too narrow for me in the midfoot but am happy to report I did not experience that with the Glycerin 22.

Heel cushion feels weirdly puffy when you first put it on but I stopped noticing it quickly. Lockdown was fine though laces seem a bit short. It feels lighter underfoot than it's predecessor, and is firm and more responsive than the glycerin 21 as well. Definitely feels like a shoe that's geared toward long and slow for someone who doesn't like a lot of squish underfoot. Kind of reminds me of the Novablast 4 but without the rocker. I think if you like the Glycerin 21, you'll love the 22. It's not a massive upgrade, but a nice subtle pivot toward modern premium materials and aesthetics.

I'm returning from injury so my workout was nothing to write home about: 5 min easy x 1 minute walking, repeat 4x. The shoe felt comfortable and light at my ultra easy paces (11:30-12 min/mi), suggesting it's probably best suited for long and/or easy days.

TL;DR: This not a fancy shoe ($160 price point might suggest otherwise), but a subtle upgrade for a well loved Brooks model that can handle your everyday running.",2025-01-25 22:47:02+00:00,136,54

1i9o8o1,RunningShoeGeeks,Novablast 4 60km review- tldr bad,"Recently bought a pair of NB4. Rationale was that i had some knee issues so i wanted a unplated stable daily trainer to do lower intensity long duration runs.

In store fit was great and they felt good on the treadmill. Had a 50% off voucher so used it on these. Got a half size larger as the 12.5 was a fraction snug.

Im 97kg, generally run somewhere around a 25m 5km and my lower intensity stuff is around 6 min/km. Generally been told im a midfoot striker by experts.

Upper

Nice and comfy fit but hottest shoe ive owned, i dont know what material they used but its winter here and my feet feel like they are in a oven.

Foam

Firm but feels light and nice at first. Base is quite wide so good stability with these two elements. Im not sure if im alone however but my right foot gets numb around the forefoot after 5km odd. I spoke to some on here who said it may break in. Hit the 50km mark and had the sensation but not too bad so was hoping my run today would be the end of it. I could not have been more wrong as it felt like a large rock was lodged underneath my forefoot at 6km, had to stop running due to the pain and numbness, i can live with alot but this has made the shoe unusable for me.

Grip

A note on the grip, it is the worst ive seen in a running shoe. Slightest bit of wet or mud and it loses all traction.

Overall

I really wanted to love these shoes but man, they are awful. Im really confounded by positive reviews as i think even without numb element, these shoes are not great imo.

Other shoes:

Endorphin pro 3 - great 10km race shoe
Endorphin pro 4 - not as fast feeling but better version imo
Altra escalante racer - great minimalist shoe that i retired and miss
Endorphin speed 3 - probably the closest thing to best daily trainer ive used
Takumi sen 8 - mysteriously fast but uncomfortable
Hyperion tempo - fantastic shoe for shorter distances, retired.
More v4 - good recovery shoe but too slow for anything else",2025-01-25 14:36:42+00:00,55,179

1i90yek,RunningShoeGeeks,Nike Pegasus Plus - Follow Up Review after 500km,"I have now covered over 300 miles (500km) in my Pegasus Plus. See my initial 100km review here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/comments/1eyuiy5/nike_pegasus_plus_100km_review_best_uptempo_daily

As I haven’t seen many reviews since the launch, I thought I will give you fellow geeks an update on this model.

Just to repeat from my last review for those of you too lazy to click on the link:

My profile: 
32 m, 184cm (6 ft), 79kg (174 lbs), forefoot striker, currently in marathon training doing 40-50mpw.

Distance covered: 498km (309 miles)

What I used it for: Easy to recovery mid-week run (5:40 – 6:30 min/km) up to 10 km; Mid-week club track workouts – variety of 400s, 800s, 1k, 1 mile workouts typically up to 12 km (paces anything between 3:30 min/km  to 4:30 min/km)

In my initial review I said this was the best up-tempo trainer since Speed 2. I still stand by that statement, although I found some gaps where the Speed 2 was more suitable, and Peg Plus is less so. There is a good reason for that. What are the gaps? Well, the Peg Plus has a very traditional feeling to it. This is not a pro or con, but rather a characteristic. This is the no-nonsense feeling I described in my first review. They don’t have an aggressive rocker, bouncy platform, or stability features. They are therefore a bit too “basic” for a run where you would like to see the roll/bounce, eg. longer tempo/threshold segments. Even though it was not unpleasant, I can honestly admit that for those type of workouts, I was reaching for other more suitable shoes like the Superblast 2 or more recently the Evo SL.

One thing I did not mention in the first review is that when I first got these shoes I was nursing a mild case of plantar fasciitis. It was something that I picked up during my house move last summer and continued all the way until recently, but never stopped me from running. Why do I mention this? Because I honestly believe that running in the Peg Plus benefited my recovery. I do not often say things like this, as I firmly believe that physiotherapy is always the solution, but in this case I could feel relief in that area from my feet working a bit harder than other stiffer shoes I own. This is to do with the flexibility and geometry they offer – a rare thing in the world of modern heavily rockered, max stack and plated trainers, where your feet experience a limited range of movement. This, in addition to the rehab work, allowed me to fully resolve the PF issues in a few months which I am well chuffed with.

I am not going to repeat myself on the feeling of midsole, outsole or upper. They all performed the same (brilliantly) from day one throughout the 500 km of running. I go back to my original review and I can confirm that I still stand by everything I wrote there. It was only in the last 50km where I started noticing that they were going a bit flat and bottoming out. This is not unusual for my shoes though and you can read more on that here, where I explain why I retire most of my shoes between around 500-600km mark:
https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/comments/1fdcwkj/why_we_change_shoes_when_they_still_have_plenty/

In terms of durability the Peg Plus held up brilliantly. The outsole is like new, so is the upper. The midsole shows creasing which is typical for all ZoomX shoes, but this is only visual. I plan on putting them in the washing machine soon and continue using them for casual wear and other sports/gym.

I know the most controversial thing about this model is the price, especially on the US market where if I understand correctly, they only cost $20 less than the Superblasts 2. I can’t comment on other markets but from my perspective in the UK where I live these shoes have been readily available since launch for about £120 with different retailers, which is similar to what you can get the Rebel v4, Novablast 4/5 and the Evo SL for. I paid peanuts for my pair due to being given some Nike gift cards, but I wouldn’t be disappointed if I paid the full £120. Perhaps a bit underwhelmed if I paid the RRP of £165, but at £120 they are well worth it. I suspect we will see them sub-£100 in sales later this year as all retailers seem to hold an abundance of inventory in the typical Nike fashion.

As a conclusion, I am going to say that I was happy to use these in my off-season months, where I did less long distance running and more speed work and shorter races. Now that I am back to marathon training, I will be using them a lot less and replacing them with the Evo SL which are better suited for the types of workouts I have planned. I will be glad to go back to the trustworthy Peg Plus when the HMs/marathons are out of the way and I get a bit of a break from longer distances.

It is a great choice if: a) you’re not running longer than 8-10 miles and want a versatile neutral trainer; b) you run long distances but have a dedicated shoe for those; c) don’t like stiff midsoles and prefer a traditional feeling shoe",2025-01-24 17:33:30+00:00,115,27

1i8uyss,RunningShoeGeeks,Metaspeed Sky + / Paris Comparison,"Taller/heavier runner (180lbs) - average 70mpw with marathon pace around 6:10 min/mi, workouts at 5:20-45, and easy days round 7:45-8:00+

Metaspeed Sky + @200mi - raced 10mi + training
Metaspeed Sky Paris @100mi - raced 10k & marathon + training 

TLDR: Sky Paris is a more dynamic, exciting shoe underfoot, but if I had to race in one of the two at any distance I would choose the Sky + as it is more aggressive and encourages a faster turnover to lock into paces.

Recently got my Sky Paris over 100 miles and figured I write a review on how they compare to the Sky +.

Upper/fit: 
TTS in both and wouldn’t go up or down in either. Unless an upper is causing me to bleed, is way too loose, or making a shoe excessively heavy, I really don’t care to much about an upper if I’m being honest. Here the Sky + wins as while made of a softer material the Sky Paris certainly has extra material and is much more baggy in the forefoot when you tighten down the laces. Laces are ace on both of them.

Weight:
The Sky Paris wins here, coming in at 198.5g in my size 11.5us with the Sky + a whole 21.3g heavy at 219.8g.

Midsole: 
The big change is from the in-house nylon-based FFturbo of the Sky + to the new peba of the FFturbo+ in the Sky Paris (not confusing naming convention there at all). Theses two shoes have a drastically different underfoot feel - the Sky+ (while still really light) has the firmer, denser FFturbo that has a more slappy rebound and takes more force to compress as much as the Sky Paris. The Sky Paris on the other hand feels much more airy and is able to compress further and with less force giving it a softer ride. While the foam is an improvement for shorter, tempo efforts I found if I wanted to really go fast as well as during the late stage of a marathon that the Sky Paris was too soft to encourage me to hold pace and I ended up having to somewhat fight the shoe which was encouraging me to relax.

Durability:
Both are holding up great besides some cosmetic wear. The Sky + did have a change at around 150 which is when the first clear wear on the outsole rubber showed up as well as it started to feel flat/dead under foot in the last 20mi or so, but that may have been due to single digit temps this winter. The Sky Paris on the other hand has softened up with the plate becoming less rigid and while I’m not concerned the new outsole rubber shows a lot more wear at this point than the Sky + did.

I think ASICS did an outstanding job on both of these shoes, especially in terms of build quality and design. I am honestly surprised I ultimately prefer the Sky + to the Paris as it is certainly the “less-lively” of the two, but personally the faster pick.

1i8d1ga,RunningShoeGeeks,Saucony ride 18 : initial thoughts,"Looking for a pair of running shoes that do everything, I recently bought the latest Ride and after two first outings and 10 miles covered, here is my first opinion:

  
First of all I have to say that the upper is a delight in terms of comfort and fit, the padding on the heel and tongue are excellent and very pleasant to the touch (very soft material like silk), you really feel like you're putting on slippers. The pwwrn+ insole adds an extra touch of comfort, you really have a premium feeling.

The fit is also very good, the lacing system is effective and the foot is well supported, the only downside is that the laces are a bit long, I have to tie a double knot to prevent them from touching the ground. The heel is very well supported, no problem with slipping like my narrow feet can have in many other models.

I took my usual size 9.5 and it's perfect, enough room at the front and the toe box is neither too big nor too narrow.

After these first very good impressions when putting them on, it's time to run with them, the midsole (pwwrn+) is very protective, neither too firm nor too soft, which offers great versatility, you can feel a little touch of bounce.

The stability is also good for a neutral shoe, I usually use stability shoes (tempus, Guide, GT2000...) but for now I have had no problems with them, my stride is freer, less constrained than with my previous pairs but my stride remains well centered and I do not feel my ankles collapsing.

Last point but perhaps the least positive, the outsole. I ran on wet roads and I did not feel very much traction, it slides a little, nothing catastrophic. On the other hand, the rubber cover of the sole is very good, which should guarantee good durability.

To sum up, if you are looking for a versatile, durable and comfortable shoe with excellent value for money, the Ride 18 is definitely worth a try!",2025-01-23 20:25:02+00:00,40,41

1i7z1fd,RunningShoeGeeks,Saucony Guide 17 has impressed! (Not exactly a review),"I'm a beginner runner doing a very long and drawn out couch to 5k program. Heavier runner with overpronation, wide flat feet and a history of regular foot niggles through my younger years. 

Am privileged to be in a position to slowly test out multiple different running shoes in the quest for the most comfortable ones. (Vinted has been my playground, lots of my shoes have been second hand in good/great condition.) Started out with the likes of the Nimbus and Kayano series and gradually expanded my collection of mostly stable neutral type shoes.

Bought the Guide 17 for under £50 second hand with reportedly minimal mileage from a non-pro seller. Fit well on trying (UK men's size 8) and outsole had minimal visible wear.

First run in them today (W6R2) after a break of 5 days since my previous run. And wow. 

I had come out thinking I would have a slow day by my already slow standards, as I had just finished a couple of night shifts and had only just returned to my normal sleep routine.

But to my surprise, right from the start the run felt great! Superbly comfortable underfoot with hardly any issues even in the initial stages of my run, and found myself in a rhythm faster than my previous runs yet comfortable. Feet and ankles felt secure and worry free the entire time, and damp road and tile were no problem either.

Another small bonus was that I ran my fastest 1k/1mile so far! I know I've been improving steadily on the program but that was a lovely little boost. 

In conclusion, I can whole heartedly recommend the Guide 17 as an option to look at for other beginner runners who may be in a similar position. This one is a keeper!",2025-01-23 08:40:02+00:00,24,31
1i7lrwe,RunningShoeGeeks,Adios Pro 4 First Run - average runner perspective.,"Male 41y/o 6’2 175lbs. 21:30 5k, 45:00 10k, 1:52:XX 1/2 (my 1/2 is much slower because of any injury I was dealing with last year). 
 
Size 11. Same size I wear in Nike Vapor/alphafly 3’s, Evo Sl, Hyperion Max 2, Speed 4, but I was an 11.5 in endorphin speed 3 and pro 3’s. 

I never wore the Adios pro 3, so I can’t comment on that, but when I first put this on I was amazed at how soft it seemed comparable to all the above mentioned shoes. Maybe a little comparable to the Alphafly in that regard, but it’s not really the same type of sensation. That being said, even aside from the fact that it  blistered my feet something terrible, I really disliked the alphafly 3. Something just felt weird about it to me on my foot. Like I was running on top of the ground in a “device” or something. Just not for me I guess.  

The endorphin pro 3 has been my favorite race shoe for anything above a 5k…I like the Vaporfly for 5k and shorter. I need to go run with the EP3 one foot and the AP4 on the other to really feel a side by side, but I think this one may have jumped into my first place. 

Today my plan was a mile warmup followed by 10k at my hopeful spring half marathon pace of around 7:40/mi. On my warmup mile, the shoe didn’t feel out of place running around 8-9 minute mile pace. First mile of the 10k I hit 7:19, and was feeling really good so I decided to keep that pace up for the next two miles. Slowed down a little for the last three, and ended up running it at an average of 7:22, and my third fastest 10k. Anecdotally, this pace is almost exact to a 10k race I did on New Year’s day, and my heart rate was a lot better today. That could simply be that I was wearing my chest strap today and not during that race, so the data was more accurate, but I was sitting around 175bpm today and the race was in the mid 180s. 

I was really surprised that the shoe, at least to me, didn’t really feel that soft once I got up around my race paces. It reminded me a lot of the EP3, but maybe just slightly more bounce. Additionally, I don’t know the specs to regurgitate, but I feel like the rocker on this (and the evo Sl) is much more pronounced than any other shoe I have, and I REALLY like that tipping forward sensation. I feel like I’m a mid foot striker, but every video I see in slow mo looks like heel, but in this shoe I feel like I’m really on my toes without having to force it. I purposely tried to land on just the heel a few times, and I could see what some reviewers have said about it compressing and feeling a little harsh….but, that was trying really hard. End of the day I’m likely a heel striker and they felt fantastic to me. I’ve also heard some reviews talking about the suction sensation or sound. I think that’s the foam squishing to the sides when loaded and then when releasing the sticky tread knobs are like scraping the pavement and making a noise. 

I didn’t feel it during the run, but once I stopped I realized that I had a little rubbing on my heel. I thought I was going to take off my sock and see a blister, but to my surprise it was just a little red. I think once my feet get used to them it’ll be a non issue. 

All in all, big fan. Primarily because it feels like a shoe as obvious as that sounds. A really fast shoe. I feel connected to the ground with tactile feedback. Wasn’t unstable to me in the least, and much more so than Evo Sl that I can get a little wobbly in on corners. Also the only shoe that I’ve ever had the sensation of being able to tell that it’s probably meant for people way faster than me. But, I didn’t feel like I wasn’t utilizing it at my pace (unlike the Alphafly). So yeah…good stuff. Hopefully something in this ramble is valuable to someone. I’m not a shoe reviewer, but happy to answer any questions. ",2025-01-22 20:57:38+00:00,78,55

1i6l5ft,RunningShoeGeeks,Reebok Floatride 6 -- First impressions.,"Male

Short distance runner, US9 size, mid foot striker, 172cm 65kg

\-

I used to have the Floatride Energy 3 in my rotation not long ago and that shoe surprised me in terms of durability and versatility and it even outlasted my most reliable shoe at that time (Vomero 16).

Fast forward to 2025, I bought version 6 this time and I think I can make direct comparisons with Boston 12 which I have more than 200K on it.

My first run in Floatride Energy 6 was 10K run with a wide range of paces ( 4:40km to 4:10km)

My second run was 5K with a more stable pace (4:00km to 3:50km)

I will start with the best part of the shoe which is the outsole: I ran on smooth concrete and then less stable surfaces like gravel road. I took fast sharp turns on my 5K run to test their grip and they performed well above their price range. Almost no difference between the continental rubber that I got on my Boston 12 in terms of road grip.

The second best part was the upper which has more padding than I would need. It is no problem during winter but in the summer it may cause problems. I usually prefer a slim tongue, just enough padding to prevent lace pressure. The toe box is snug and gives a little less room than Boston 12 but overall quality and comfort are slightly better.

The midsole is less impressive than other parts of the shoe. Step in feeling similar to Boston 12 but when in faster paces Floatride 6 falls short which is kind of expected. It gives more sidewall support than it used to (compared to version 3) but it is not faster.

Overall, Floatride Energy 6 is perfect for a variety of terrains and slow to steady runs. It has more than enough stack for short distance runs. Probably the best value shoe in my rotation right now.

1i5va2j,RunningShoeGeeks,Inov8 Roadfly,"US M9, 265 g/9.3 oz. 
27mm heel, 21mm forefoot 

Have gotten so me decent mileage on these over the last month, or so, and thought I would share my experience with them.

I’ve used these for several runs, totaling ~ 60 miles/100k. This includes a number of daily runs, as well as a long-ish run, and some tempo work on a variety of asphalt and concrete roads and running paths.

I purchased mine in a US M9, and they fit true to size. They did send me the Wide version, and despite my very average width feet, it turned out to be a decent fit when laced properly, but it is definitely right on the edge. So, be aware that those with truly wide feet may need something wider, and those with narrower feet will want to be sure they get the standard width.

Fit: TTS. Average width foot fits well in wide version with good lace adjustment. But may fit well in standard, also. Upper is comfortable, relatively lightweight, with flared heel collar and secure fit. No issues with slippage or sloppy fit. Confidence inspiring lockdown. The midfoot is perfectly snug, while the wider “anatomical” toe box allows some additional toe splay and movement.

Ride: Refreshing. In a world of ever-increasing stack heights, where even my “mid-stack” daily trainers are approaching 40mm, the relatively low profile of this shoe is a nice break. At 27/21, which includes the proper Powerflow Pro midsole, the Boomerang TPU insole, and the rubber outsole, there is a welcomed sense of road feel, nimbleness and sure-footedness underfoot. The midsole offers great protection, dampening the impact at landings, while allowing quick turnover and good mechanics. Also important to this shoe’s design is the full rubber outsole. It is a fairly grippy compound, with a series of flex grooves, making for great traction and agility on the road. Grip has been outstanding in both dry and wet conditions. This all comes together to make this an exceptionally versatile shoe, which I have taken on comfortable slower runs, faster paced workouts, and longer runs up to 16 miles. Running in this shoe left me feeling great, including the noticeable engagement of muscles that have been vacationing a bit through the use of taller, bouncier shoes.


Final Thoughts: 

Overall, a really enjoyable shoe, which I will be making a core part of a pared down rotation as I prepare for a PR in Boston this April. Versatile, fun, and really adding something important in terms of strength and form development. Would like to see maybe a bit of weight come off in the next version, with perhaps slightly thinner rubber on the outsole, and a bit more beveling and sculpting around the heel. But that’s if I’m nitpicking. The road feel, inherent stability, nimble sure-footedness, all make these an excellent choice. In these, I feel like I can tackle a long run, sprint away from loose dogs, or scale a building, if necessary. These are the shoes I would want if I were Batman. I am happy that I picked these up, and think they’re definitely worth trying on if you have the opportunity.",2025-01-20 17:14:25+00:00,30,34

1i5g9vu,RunningShoeGeeks,"Warning About ON Shoes: Defects, Customer Support, and Warranty Issues","I wanted to share my recent experience with ON Shoes to warn others about their customer support, warranty policies, and overall quality. ON markets itself as a premium brand that brings “On Happiness” and promises shoes that make you feel like you’re walking on clouds. But the reality, especially when dealing with defective products, is far less magical.

Here’s what happened:  
I purchased a pair of ON shoes, and from the start, the foam in the arch on the right shoe felt off. It wasn’t about fit or breaking the shoes in—it was clearly a manufacturing defect in the foam support. To make matters worse, the right shoe also developed a squeak. I tried to resolve this directly with ON support, thinking a premium brand would stand behind its product.

Instead, after weeks of back-and-forth, they denied my warranty claim, saying they couldn’t identify a defect through the photos I provided. Of course, the issue is inside the foam arch, so it’s not something you can show in a picture. They also dismissed the squeak as irrelevant, even though it’s another symptom of the defect.

When I pushed back, they told me their warranty doesn’t cover “fit, feel, or squeaking” and said the decision was final. Basically, unless you can perfectly photograph the defect, you’re out of luck. Even if it’s a clear manufacturing issue, their policy doesn’t seem to account for anything they can’t see in a picture.

By the way, squeaking seems to be a known issue with their shoes. [Why do Oncloud shoes always end up squeaking : r/ONrunning](https://www.reddit.com/r/ONrunning/comments/1b7sxkg/why_do_oncloud_shoes_always_end_up_squeaking/), [How to Get Rid of On Running Shoe Squeak : r/RunningShoeGeeks](https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/comments/18nz5bg/how_to_get_rid_of_on_running_shoe_squeak/), etc. To be clear, my issue is not the squeak it's the actual structural issues in my shoe, the squeak is a side-effect.

To add insult to injury, I’d been trying to resolve this before their 30-day return window closed. Because I took time to give the shoes a chance to wear in and waited for support to respond, the return window was almost gone by the time I got my answer. They weren’t interested in accommodating the delay or acknowledging the time spent communicating with them.

Now, I have a defective pair of shoes from a brand that acts like they’re redefining quality, but their support and warranty process couldn’t be further from that image. I’ve had better experiences with much less expensive brands.

**What you should know before buying ON shoes:**

* If you receive a defective pair, especially for something inside the shoe (like foam in the arch or heel), you might not be able to get an exchange or refund unless it’s visible in a photo.
* Squeaking shoes? They won’t help you—it’s “not covered.”
* Their 30-day return policy isn’t flexible, even if delays are on their end.
* They don’t seem to stand behind their product in the way you’d expect from a “premium” brand.

I’ve never seen such poor customer support from an athleisure brand that positions itself as high-end. It’s shocking, honestly. If you’re considering ON Shoes, be warned: they’re amazing at marketing, but when it comes to quality and customer care, you’re better off with another brand.

**Curious if others have had similar issues when they had a need to contact ON customer support? Either way, it's icky all around**

1i50qsy,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Bondi 9 first impressions ,"M. 6ft2. 85kg. Mar 2:57. HM 1:26  
Other shoes I use/d (some have been retired/sold on) . Hoka Mach 6, Puma Deviate nitro, Puma Magmax, Hoka Cielo x1, Saucony Triumph 20, NB SC trainer v2, On cloudsurfer

First thought on the Bondi 9. 
Took the Bondis out for an easy 6km recovery run at 5:30 (min/km) pace today.  

Fit: went normal Hoka size and fits fine (I find Hoka is a half size small though compared to other brands so I go half a size up if you’ve never tried Hoka on before). I would say it’s maybe ever so slightly shorter than my other Hoka’s but not an issue. 

Ride: I read somewhere that the midsole now uses the same/similar midsole to the Mach 6 and to be fair I actually thought it had a bit of similar feel under foot to the Mach. Now obviously it’s a lot bigger and heavier so won’t be the same use case for the shoes but the softness/compression/bounce is similar between the shoes. Best way I would describe them between the 2 is if you’ve ever bounced in a trampoline - if you bounce in the centre you’ll notice it’s a bit smoother and “longer” of a bounce and less of a instant reaction (that’s the Bondi). Whereas if you go slightly towards the outside of the trampoline it’s a “quicker”/shaper reaction and bounce (that’s the Mach), it’s a similar feeling but slightly different. An imperfect analogy but sure you get the idea. 

Upper: very plush. Has a lovely step in comfort feel but does have a lot of padding so think could be a warm shoe in hotter climates. Very comfortable though. 

Weight: I don’t know what the exact weight is but in the hand does feel heavy, but on the run actually didn’t seem too bad. I am running on very tired legs after a lot of mileage recently so that’s definitely effecting it but overall I actually didn’t find it to bad in terms of feel on foot. 

Expected use case for it: I got the shoe mainly as an easy day/recovery day shoe and think will probably slip in there perfectly (suspect will also use it for my easy long runs as well). I do also have a 100km road ultra coming up so starting to figure out which shoes I will be using for that (also a reason I picked these up to both baby the legs and see if these could work for it). 
Off first impression not sure if these will be for that. Will see how they break in but would probably like to go for something a little lighter on the foot (both in terms of actual weight and general padding to let my foot breath a bit more). 

Most similar to in terms of competition: from what I have tried I think they very similar to the Puma Magmax. I think the Puma would be a bit better at picking up the pace while the Bondi will probably be a bit better as cruising speeds but that’s just off my initial impressions. 

Will revert once have done more distance in them to see how they hold up. 

Happy to answer any questions. ",2025-01-19 15:19:29+00:00,98,73
1i50ov7,RunningShoeGeeks,First two runs on the Triumph 20,"

About Me: M45, 5'9' (1,79 mts) and 180 pounds (82 kg), been runing for 4 years consistently, and currently training for a half marathon on march.

The Run: did one run yesterday, 5 miles (8km) and today was 7 miles, both easy run with a pace around (:40 - 9:27 miles per minute (5:40 - 6 minutes per KM).

Upper: Felt super conformtable! Simple, nothing too crazy, but fits great! I am an 12.5 but went with a 13 in these, after readeing some sizins sugestions in here. Toes have plenty of room to move and feels super confortable.

Midsole:I got these to replace my Asics Gel Nimbus 26. I got 500 miles on them (around 800 km) and I was starting to feel they got a little flat. I live in Argentina, and in my country we don't get the latest models righ away, and when the arrive, it's very hard to find my size. After looking for a replacement, came across a post on reddit, that someone did as a review for the Triumph 20 after using it for 1000 km. Everyone was leaving very positives experiences, and since they are not a bran new shoe, I found them on the Saucony official store for my country on sale, and they had my size! Paid arounf 100 dollars for them, and when taking in consideration the price we pay in here for shoes it's a very good deal. Two runs I did felt great! Cushioned enough to get the easy runs done, but firm in a way that you can pick up the pace for some strides or shorts tempo no problem.

Outsole: Amazing grip, yesterday was raining and they didn't feel slippery at all. From what I've read these are very durable shoes, and it sure looks like they can take a beating. I hope haha.

Comparisons: First, i had the New Balance 1080 V12 for my easy and daily training, but I never got used to them. Felt to firm, flat, and neither very cushioned or soft. Sold them and got the Asics Gel Nimbus 26 and they were gret for me, but it's definitively a shoe for easy and recovery runs. With these, as I said before, they look like I can speed up and they feel very responsive.

Overall: Pretty happy with the purchase. After one month of looking for a replacement, and not able to find one, I thank that i come across the post that recommended them, and lucky that they were avaialble and on sale. Guess it's not necesary to buy the latest and greatest all the time, specially for a daily trainer that need to take the miles and last a long time.

I know these may no te a very exciting review, since they are not a new shoe, but wanted to share in case someones is looking for a cheap alternative that can do easy runs and also pick up the pace when needed.

Loookimf fowar to hearing the experiences of other fellow runners that used these ones!! :D",2025-01-19 15:17:07+00:00,34,17

1i3taxb,RunningShoeGeeks,"Supershoes: Actual, real weights ","Having been in running retail for over 20 years, and having done some product consultation as well for a few brands, I've always had think for wanting to know the actual data, and most, if not all catalogs are produced in advance with non-production shoes. So, here is my running list of supershoes in a US men's size 10, euro 44.

All shoes have been weighed out of the box using the same digital scale. All weights are in grams.

Deviate Elite 1 - 216  
Deviate Elite 2 - 238  
Deviate Elite 3 - 212  
Adios Pro 3 - 228  
Adios Pro 4 - 209  
EVO 1 - 143  
AlphaFly 3 - 228  
Vaporfly 2 - 215  
Vaporfly 3 - 195  
Metaspeed Sky Paris - 202  
Takumi 9 - 197

And as a control, two fairly normal trainers using new foams, but not generally considered supershoes:  
Deviate 1 - 258  
Deviate 2 - 287  
Deviate 3 - 293

I'm an older runner, so I would have killed to have had Vaporflys when I was in my prime and running 2:40 for the marathon. But now, almost 60 years old, and with a surgically repaired back, I'm using these more to reduce pounding on my body after 45 years of running. These shoe reflect my journey into finding the shoes that I can use as trainers to keep myself as injury free as possible.

Sharing some more data for all us shoe geeks out there.

1i3mhtc,RunningShoeGeeks,361 Furious 2 - First Run Review,"So a bit about me before we get into it - I'm 6'1 68kg, HM is 1:35 10k is 45:19 and 5k 21:00. I'm going to compare it mostly to the Vaporfly 2 because that's the only other racing shoe I've ran in. I usually take a size 10.5/11 UK but sized down to a 10 for this shoe, which was the right call. If you're looking to buy I'd definitely size down a half to be safe.

So after running in my VF2s until they were basically nothing more than a carbon plate I decided to have a look at the newer racing shoes on the market. They were all extremely expensive though, even with discounts you would be lucky to find any of them for 200 quid. So naturally I looked for alternatives and a big thank you to the members of this subreddit for making the Chinese brands more accessible to a western audience! After seeing Kassie Derseh Kindie ran 2:05:54 in this shoe in Berlin last year I decided to pick them up

So I did 4x1k at 3:50-4:00 minute pace, with warmups and cool downs it ended up around 6.5k in total. The shoe is very very good, it's well cushioned but without feeling like a brick on your feet and extremely bouncy. I wouldn't like to run anything slower than like 5:00 per km in these simply because I would have to consciously slow down, during my warmup I felt like I was jumping up and down to stop myself from speeding up. While I loved the VF2 I did have problems with it's support, in tight corners I was less confident but that isn't an issue with this. The VF2 does feel much lighter on foot though, despite them being very similar in weight. 

The upper is nothing to write home about, which is what I want in a shoe. It's a very light material but still comfortable and the laces lock down very well. There's enough support that you're not uncomfortable but not too much to weigh it down.

The midsole is really fun, as I said earlier I would describe it as bouncy, if you buy into the Stride vs Cadence runner thing this is definitely a Stride running shoe. I felt like the Vaporfly was better for cadence but obviously it is still a great shoe either way. The plate is unobtrusive, while I knew it was there I didn't feel it in the same way I do in the VF2.

Outsole was good, there doesn't look like much there to be honest and it was a dry day today so I can't say what the wet weather grip is like, but I was confident around corners and could stop very quickly quite easily

It cost me 131 euro for this on the 361 page on Aliexpress, which in my opinion makes it incredible value for the shoe you get. If money is no object I can see something like the Alphafly 3 or the Deviate Nitro Elite 3 being a safer bet but to be honest I'm extremely pleased with it and I hope I can dispel some apprehension about non western brands by posting this review. 361 also have a European store but it's 180 euro for the shoe there, and considering it only took 9 days for it to arrive to Ireland it makes sense to get it from China instead.",2025-01-17 18:02:08+00:00,123,48

My initial thoughts are that I love them and they are a brilliant running shoe, but definitely have some points to be considered before making the purchase. 

For reference I’m 39(m), 5’7, 66kg. Running 4 to 5 times a week and currently training for a marathon. I’m aiming for a marathon time of between 3hrs and 3hrs 15mins. 

I’ve been doing most of my running in the Superblast 2 and actually enjoy running in them so much I considered using them for the marathon, but listened to advice and decided to get a race day shoe. 

I watched about 100 YouTube videos on various shoes, but if I’m honest I got caught up in a bit of the recency hype around this shoe and all the positive reviews so decided to jump in. 

My initial thoughts. 

Fit - I wear a 7.5uk in all my shoes but there is a lot of variance in that size depending on the shoe. My Superblast 2 are way longer than this shoe and the Pro4 is definitely a small 7.5. However saying that, it actually fits my better than the SB2. It just feels snug, but not tight at all. This is a very narrow shoe, if you like a bit of room or don’t like a really fitted feel, I think you’ll struggle with this. 

The laces are fairly short too, I almost always use a runners loop, but the laces came out because the knot was too small. I changed out of the loop and then it was fine, because of the snug fit I didn’t need the loop anyway. 

Upper - The upper is amazing on this shoe. It has a strong but soft feeling. It’s pretty cold where I am now so can’t comment on how breathable it is, but overall it feels great, and between this and the fit I got an amazing lock down. 

Midsole - This is where things get really exciting. The new light strike pro is both cushioned and super responsive. I felt like I was being propelled along by the shoe, and the just make you want to run fast. The carbon rods and position of the rocker just seem to turn your feet over so quickly, and when I started to speed up I felt like I was gliding along. The front foot midsole has a good width to it considering how narrow the upper is and this helped the shoe to feel stable. 

 Outsole - You can barely see the grip on these shoes, but it’s honestly great. I felt like I had a lot of traction throughout the run, even when running on slightly wet ground. I had a couple of situations where I had to quickly slow down on the run (a dog ran out in front of me) and the grip really helped here too. 

Some other points to mention.

This is a really light shoe, but it feels really stable under foot. You can feel the thickness of the midsole and the cushion. But you bounce out of it even quicker than you sink in. 

This seems to be a show for pushing the pace, I’ll give it a go at slower paces, but I feel than this will be one kept for best efforts and races. 

I picked them up for £198, it’s not cheap but seems reasonable for how much you are getting with this show. 

Overall a brilliant new shoe from Adidas, as long as you can get the size to fit you correctly. ",2025-01-16 20:05:01+00:00,179,52

I think the mileage speaks for itself. I am really enjoying these shoes.

Total covered distance: >1000 miles / >1600km

Terrain covered: Asphalt, light gravel, track's synthetic rubber.

Weather: Mostly sunny but with some rainy days.

Me:

* Weight: \~63kg
* Height: 181cm
* Avg. Cadence: 175 - 180
* Strike Type: Forefoot/Midfoot

(EDITED): Additional photos: [https://imgur.com/a/Tnk7Wuq](https://imgur.com/a/Tnk7Wuq)

As an easy-day trainer and partner in some steady long runs, this shoe never let me down. I always enjoyed how the Saucony shoes rolled under my feet and this was no exception. In the first batch of kilometres (for me, about \~400km) the foam felt quite firm, which even though was a positive experience, was not what I was initially expected from a max-cushion daily/recovery trainer. But then the foam started to soften up. Is quite difficult to describe the foam evolution, but I would say that there is a very sharp diffrence at the \~400km mark, almost like if the foam reached a yield stress point and started to behave differently (perhaps due to material deformation, though I’m not an expert on how polymers like these respond to stress). After that mark the shoe soften up dramatically, but still retained my favourite detail about them, **how they rolled**. They started to feel much more forgiving to my feet and knees, retaining a confident stability at slower paces, and still offering spectacular rolling feedback.

Yes, when you pick up the pace (<4:30km/min) they are clunky and unstable, but I would never expect this shoe to perform like that in such conditions. Just for comparison, previously, I owned a pair of Nike Invincible 3, which besides the great foam (a good chunk of ZoomX), I never liked the way they fitted (too wide) and how they rolled. They felt too flat under my foot and did not have the same formula of stability and softness the Triumph 20 offer after that important yield point.

The upper is quite breathable but is not on par with the Flyknit Nike offers in their top end shoes. It is quite elastic and adapts well to the feet, but does not offer much more beyond that. I have noticed reports of quality issues where the upper meets the big toe area, sometimes leading to holes forming, but thankfully, I haven’t experienced this problem myself.

Talking about durability, oh well, 1000miles and I am not looking to stop stacking them miles... The durability is phenomenal. Besides some problems with the upper, the shoes has hold exceptionally well. The outer rubber traction still inspires some confidence in the turns (except when it rains), the inner foam still soft but supportive and the upper still holding up, just wow. Note that I am quite skinny runner at \~63kg and 181cm, which might influence how some of these components age.

I purchased them for around 100€ which offers the most cost per kilometre of any shoe I ever owned. I’m considering getting another pair, perhaps the Triumph 21 if they still are around, to replace this set when they eventually wear out.

TLDR: Good shoes, quite durable and cheap.",2025-01-15 23:07:36+00:00,93,51

1i1z4l7,RunningShoeGeeks,Adidas Adios 9 - First Impressions,"TL:DR - fantastic workout shoes and a potential fast daily trainer for folks who don't mind ground feel.

About me: 46M, 5'10, 84kg, prefers 5k and half-Marathon to 10k & full-Marathon, but have done a few of all in the last couple years. Recently switched focus to Hyrox, and have been looking for a shoe that works well for that specifically.

I've been wanting a low-stack fast shoe for workouts for a long time. I tried the Kinvara 14, and they were too flat and stiff for me to enjoy them. I tried the Takumi Sen 8; even stiffer, and the upper was horrific. I've narrow feet, but they were taking narrow to the extreme. It was a horrible scratchy material, and I dreaded shoving my feet into them. I'd considered the Adios8; they got a good rating, but I'd heard the 9 would have full Lightstrike Pro, so held off.  I think I've made the right decision. They retail for £120 in UK, and I think that's really good for what they are.

Out of the box, the first impression was WOW - they are super light. They look great too - these are a very good looking shoe. I really like Adidas styling anyway, I wear their casual shoes all the time. On the feet, they are very comfortable, the upper is excellent. I particularly like the tongue. It has just enough padding that laces don't feel constricting and bitey, as Adidas laces are prone to do. The laces are the only negative about the upper; Adidas insist in using sh\*t laces. Midsole is full Lightstrike Pro. This is the dream. They feel amazing from toe to heel. Sole is the new Lighttraxxion, which looks cool, and bonus, covers the entire midsole, so won't see parts of it crumbling. Size-wise, Adidas are renowned for running small (sic), so I went up to UK12 (EU47.2), as I did for SL2. Perfect fit. 

First time I used them was a HIIT session which involved a lot of burpees and sandbag lunges. They felt really stable. I was really pleased with them. I usually wear a pair of Mizuno Riders in the gym for these purposes (stable, higher heel drop, secure around the feet), and these just worked better for HIIT, and I feel like they'll be a perfect Hyrox shoe. But I needed to validate them with a run...

First run - the important part. First impression on the road is there's a nice bit of ground feel with a very mild bounce. At cruising speed (approx 5:15km pace) they felt nice; I noticed that my pace was faster than normal Z2 pace for similar effort, which I'll attribute to Lightstrike Pro; it really does propel you. I did 3k easy, then went into an interval session of 6\*400m, aiming for <3:45k pace. The minute I turned on the speed, these shoes came ALIVE. They tore through the 400m intervals with no mercy - gripping the ground for dear life and pushing me forward every step. They felt incredibly fun, and each interval was much faster than target. The only comparison I can think of is they're like driving an M-Class BMW; instant response, super-quick, and on-rails handling. The rest portions of the interval, they were happy cruising along, feeling very pleasant. I honestly was looking forward to the next interval though - the reaction is just incredible. I've not felt that in a pair of shoes in a long time.

I feel Adidas have completely NAILED these shoes. They are fantastic. I'm going to look forward to putting more KMs into them this year, as they are super-fun to run in. I can't wait to compete in them too, I think they'll be perfect Hyrox shoes, and i'll be looking forward to a few 5ks as well. I don't think I'd want to run much further than 10k in them, but that's fine, I've other shoes for that. I'm a big fan of things that do one thing well, and these really do speed well.

1i1db67,RunningShoeGeeks,"Novablast 4, 400 km and heavy guy","I'm 189 cm, 115-120 kg (variable), 1000 km per year, slow (5 km - 26 min, 10 km - 56 min), most runs are between 7 and 12 km.

Novablast 4 after 400 km, 115-120 kg weight

So, my Novablast 4s just hit 400 km mark.

The good: 
- Durability - WAY better than Nimbus 25, Glideride 3 or Trabuco Max 2, can be compared to NB Foam More v3. Rubber and foam looks very good, upper like a new (when it is clean). The heel counter in these shoes doesn't wear out at all (unlike in Nimbus and Glideride).
- They look good, not bulky and heavy l hit it's matter of taste.
- Aren't too soft, even for heavy guys like. Bit firmer than Nimbus. Both aren't especially fun (Puma Magnify Nitro 2 is ideal, a lot bouncier) but ok.
- No heel slippage at all, easy to have secure fit.
- Stable (for this stack height).
- Feeling not too hot (laser cut holes are helping a lot).
- No issues at all since first run (blisters, etc.) - it is not common in my case. 

Tha bad:
- They're slipping like a crazy when there's a little bit of mud, wet dirt, wet stones. Pumagrip is from another world or Continental from Adidas. Now, during the winter it is almost impossible to run in them if there's a bit of snow or ice.
- I'm not sure but they feel a little bit flat now, especially midfoot. Heel is still ok.

Overall
They are kind of workhorse - not best in separate categories but very good overall. My first choice when returned Magnify Nitro 2 under warranty (padding wear-through in heel counter after about 200 km).

1i0ghyb,RunningShoeGeeks,New pickup: Merrell Nova 3 GTX,"Posting in case someone else is also considering this for a casual running/all-day walking shoes. 

Got the Merrell Nova 3 GTX mainly as my office shoes for when it’s raining but I was also curious as to how it performs as a running shoe.

Initial impression is that it could be a great daily trainer for me, for when it just rained or there’s an impending rain. 

Its midsole is soft enough but not squishy, a tad firmer maybe, compared to my New Balance 1080v13’s Fresh Foam X, but definitely softer than my previous daily trainer which was Brooks Adrenaline GTS 22. 

At TTS of US 9.5/27.5 cm, the forefoot feels comfortably snug, hugging the arch of my foot up to lower heel. However, I do feel some heel slippage despite going with a runner’s loop. I tried going half a size down in the store but then the forefoot/toe box felt too snug. Tried with a different pair of socks (lifestyle rather than running socks), and the heel slippage is somewhat mitigated to almost absent. 

For reference, my longer foot measures 27.2 cm long. So, going with US 9/27 cm was definitely not in the cards. 

So far, with my initial 8km run, it’s a great pair. ",2025-01-13 15:29:41+00:00,26,7

1i0b365,RunningShoeGeeks,Chinese Shoes,"After some good conversation on my last 2 posts regarding Chinese shoes, I thought I might make a post to list some of the offerings from the bigger brands. 

I am by no means an expert in this field as I only own 2 pairs of Chinese shoes so far. There are a couple of redditors around that have been extremely helpful. But I did spent a decent amount of time attempting to understand the Chinese running shoe market and what they offer. 

So this post is essentially me trying to demystify the Chinese market so you don't have to, and to additionally create some conversation and gain more information that we can all share.    

Where to purchase Chinese shoes? This can vary depending on location, but generally speaking the official stores for these brands can be found on Aliexpress and or Taobao (google translate will be your friend) .     

DISCLAIMER - A certain redditor has taken offence at this post, so I just wanted to clearly state again, that I am not an expert in Chinese shoes and I never claimed to be. This thread is many hours of my time spent collating information from web reviews, reddit reviews & comments, translated Chinese product pages & translated bili bili videos. Due to that, there are probably inaccuracies in this post. This is simply intended to be a reference for what is available in China and to create discussion. If anything here is known to be incorrect, please say so, then the whole community can be wiser.    

Brands below in no particular order - 

**Anta** - c202 series (202 being the former marathon record time). Nitrogen infused midsole and geared toward half to full  marathon. 6 is the current in the series. Series 5 still readily available.   


PG7 - Easy/recovery shoe.   
Mach 4 - Speed/intensity nylon plated trainer. 24mm, 30mm for a 6mm drop. 230g US8. Mach 5 releases in Spring 2025 as a slightly lighter shoe (225g)   
Mach 4 Pro - Speed/intensity nylon plated trainer. 22mm, 28mm for a 6mm drop. 204g US8. Lighter weight and increased midsole rebound compared to non pro.   
C202 6 - versatile entry carbon plated shoe for over 4 hour marathon or training. 27mm, 33mm for a 6mm drop.   
C202 5 GT - Dropped from series 6, but still available. Equivalent to Endorphin Pro 4. A more accessible high level shoe. 25mm, 33mm for an 8mm drop. 200g US8.    
C202 G9 - Ultra lightweight carbon plated racer. 29mm, 33mm for a 4mm drop. 165g US8.    
C202 6 Pro - flagship marathon racer. 29mm, 33mm for a 4mm drop.   
C202 C10 - Super elite offering (think Adidas Pro Evo 1). 


**Xtep** - x series half to full marathon range shoe.   

2000km 3.0 - Daily non plated trainer with stability & CPU outsole reportedly rated to last 2000km. 19.5mm, 27mm for a 7.5mm drop. 232g US8.   
Onepiece 2.0 - Daily/tempo trainer with 3D printed one piece midsole. Nylon plate. 22.5mm, 29.5mm for a 7mm drop.   
360x - Plated trainer.   
260x (2.0 now out) - Carbon plated racing shoe that is probably a better speed or 5-10km racer up to half marathon. Asics Magic Speed 3 vibes. Version 1.0 is 22mm, 30mm for an 8mm drop. Version 2.0 is 26.7mm, 34.5mm for a 7.8mm drop so seems to have gone the route of magic speed 4 with increased stack and is now probably a good half marathon shoe.   
160x - This is a marathon shoe aimed at up to 4hr time. Version 3.0, 5.0 & 6.0 are more than capable at both racing and training.   (6.0 weight of 178.8g for size Eu40).        
160x Pro - this is their flagship marathon racer. 160x 3.0 Pro is almost legendary and is still used by many today in races. Version 5.0 Pro went probably too aggressive and asks alot of the runners ability. Version 6.0 Pro looks to have dialled things down from 5.0 Pro. (6.0 pro weight of 179g for size Eu40).    
160x 6.0 Monxter - Super elite offering. Similar geometry to the Mizuno wave rebellion pro 3 with a narrow heel and a big heel cutout. Definitely not for heel strikers. 16mm drop.

Jingtan 3.0 Turbo - Flagship racer with PEBA midsole. 29.5mm, 34mm for a 4.5mm drop. 165g US8.

Feiying Plaid 1.5 - Flagship marathon racer. Upgraded upper from 1.0 but otherwise almost the same. TPEE midsole which is probably the softest midsole for a Chinese marathon racer. 30mm, 37mm for a 7mm drop. 218g US9.5.   
Feiying Plaid 2.0 - Flagship marathon racer. New version just released. Firmer PEBA based midsole with a reported 95% energy return. 30mm, 37.5mm for a 7.5mm drop. 198g for a US8.

Feidian Challenger - Plated trainer or +4hr racer. 31mm, 38mm for 7mm drop. 200g US8.5.   
Feidian Elite - Agressive racer suited to 3-4 hrs and can shine at 5km- half marathon. Thermoplastic elastomer midsole. Carbon plate. GCU outsole.

1i071v2,RunningShoeGeeks,Adidas Adizero SL2,"34M, 5'8"", 190lbs, heel striker. I'm a size 10 or 10.5 in most shoes depending on how they run. Putting about 80km/55 miles a week training for London at the moment.

So I'm obsessed with great shoe deals, especially supershoe deals (My $100 CAD \[$70 USD\] brand new in box Endorphin Elites being my best deal), but I end up having too many supershoes and not enough daily trainers.

I nabbed these for $60 CAD ($42 USD for you Yanks). I initially bought the Supernova Rise for easy miles but I just hated running in them, so I went to return them and was about to fork over some extra cash for the SL2s and was pleasantly surprised to be handed a $60 gift card because the SL2 had been marked down by 60%.

15km on a treadmill, all easy pace (6:35-7:12/km).

Upper: Unremarkable, but in a good way. No issues. I got these in 10.5 and had just under a thumb's width from my big toe, so I would say they run small. I was scared that the Adizero would make it more of a race-like upper, but this is a solid daily trainer type. It's on the narrow side, but not like the Takumi Sen. Felt fine in the toe box.

Midsole: Ahhhh yes, a lovely Lightstrike Pro midsole in between the regular Lightstrike. Dense, but not stiff, energetic, not mushy. For me, just right. It was enjoyable to run in. Combined with the regular Lightstrike, I felt good about using to eat up some daily miles.

Outsole: No Continental. Can't say much as I ran on a treadmill, but if this is the worst part of the shoe, I'm not too worried. It feels like a much thicker layer of rubber and so I think it'll last.

1i0264a,RunningShoeGeeks,ASICS Nimbus 25 ,"Time to start off the new year with a fresh pair of shoes. Previously I had the Novablast 3 during a 16 week training block for an ultra. I loved them, super light and great for both long/easy runs and speed work. With them now pretty worn I decided to go for the Nimbus 25. 

Initially impressions after 100km:
- heavier than what I expected, certainly heavier than the Novablast 3 and Hoka Mach 5 I’ve used. 
- comfortable, a touch on the narrow side but not so much I needed to size up. 
- struggle to do speed work in them. They feel a bit too squidgy (if that’s a word) for any sort of tempo work. I find them a bit energy zapping when I try pick up the pace (anything faster than 5:00min/km) 
- On Easy runs where I’m purely focused on zone 2 or recovery they feel really nice and plush. 

I’m usually not one to rotate my running shoes for easy/long to speed work. I like to try grab an all rounder if possible but I think I may need to do that with these. On race day I wear a pair of Nike Vaporfly 2’s. 

So the jury is still out on the Nimbus, a nice shoe no doubt but as an all rounder I still prefer the Novablast 3. ",2025-01-13 01:03:58+00:00,132,73
1i0249o,RunningShoeGeeks,Initial Impression: Superblast 2 (compared to Nimbus 25),"https://preview.redd.it/rvxj5qbpqnce1.jpg?width=1728&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=70404bb1661d6fc129f89bdca2367965168ab578

Just received my Superblast 2 today and wore it for 1-mile treadmill run. Just want to share my first impression compared to my Nimbus 25 (age:  almost 2 years with about 400 miles (mostly treadmill))

**The Fit:** I wear 8-2E on Nimbus (also New Balance) and fit like a glove. Since Superblast doesn't come in wide, so I went up half size to 8.5. The width is comparable but obviously the length is a bit too long, but not to much to cause heel-slip.

**The Upper:** The Superblast so far seems to provide better air circulation, but I prefer the Nimbus softer materials. The Superblast tongue material appears to have some kind of rubber/plastic mixture which I don't really like. 

**The Sole (Cushion):** This is what I think Superblast hit the sweet spot. The cushion soft enough to make runs feel comfortable, but not too squishy like the Nimbus. It is in between Nimbus and Magic Speed (I tried my son's shoes).

**The Weight/Dimension:** Superblast is a big shoe, but amazingly light for their size. As you can see from the picture, the 8.5 is noticeably larger than my Nimbus 8-2E, but they don't feel heavier. The sole at inner-part of the hill kind of stick out more than I like, and depending on your gait, they might rub each other a little.

Initial verdict: I see why people like these all-around shoes. I'm not sure the $200 price tag is justified, but considering they are supposed to last longer than other shoes and other comparable shoes cost around $160, they are probably worth the pennies. If they indeed last as long as what I read/heard, I don't mind spending $200 every year in addition to another smaller/faster pairs to complete my modest/simple 2-pair rotation.",2025-01-13 01:01:21+00:00,0,30
1hztn2z,RunningShoeGeeks,Adios Pro 4: A New Hope,"My new Adidas Adios Pro 4 arrived a few days ago and I couldn’t be more excited. I had some concerns after ordering having read other reviews about sizing, Lightstrike Pro formula change etc., but after getting a quick run and a long run under my belt my fears have been all but quashed. I’ll get into that later.

As a first run I wanted to do 3 miles or so without headphones or other distractions and listen to the shoe, both figuratively and literally. It’s hard NOT to listen to them literally, as the new soles squeak like crazy on smooth surfaces like tile and hardwood floors, and make a pretty distinct sound on pavement I can only describe as a slap. I tend to strike fairly far forward on my midfoot in a reach-and-pull motion when striding, but none of my other shoes have made quite this same sound. It’s not enough to annoy, but definitely noticeable if you aren’t wearing headphones. 3 miles of gradually increasing pace to end at VO2 Max is what the run ended up being. The Adios Pro 3 always felt better with speed, and this shoe is no different in that regard.

Today’s run: 20 mile long run in my training block. I had a pair of Solar Red AP3’s earmarked for Fort Lauderdale Marathon, but these have won out by a landslide after this run. The upper disappeared on my feet after warm-up and the only contact with the ground I could feel was when the foam would hit max compression. The shoes feel somehow squishier than my 1080v3, but with all of the pep of my AP3s. It took everything I had to follow the pacing plan on my watch, and I frequently looked down to see a pace much faster than that split was supposed to be. You get lost in these shoes.

My fears about the soft new formula of Lightstrike Pro were unfounded after all. I found myself absentmindedly lightly bouncing at traffic lights because the foam feels so springy and light, but in a way that doesn’t absorb all of the energy you put into them. As far as the fit goes, I bought these TTS as I’m a 13 in all other Adidas. The upper may be slightly narrower, but I never felt like my foot was in any way cramped even though multiple running stores have said I have a wide toe box. Somehow there is a TARDIS effect with my feet and Adidas super shoes that I have never been able to figure out.

Overall, amazing work Adidas.

1hzo7k0,RunningShoeGeeks,PUMA Deviate Nitro 3 ,"I need a reliable pair of shoes for winter running alongside my Hoka Speedgoat 5s and I’ve read a long of good things about these from Asics Novablast users so when I found some for €115.00 I didn’t hesitate and bought them immediately.

https://preview.redd.it/oe6b7rfpskce1.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=a20d3d4ae04f5c131972de118eb3461a882c3069

# Fast facts

* User profile: M, 180cm, 70kg
* Shoe size: 28.5cm in all brands; EU44 in PUMA
* Average weekly mileage: 60-80km
* Running style: neutral; fore and mid-foot striker
* Run used: long runs (\~4:50-5:30/km)
* Terrain ran: dry and wet road (concrete, asphalt, cobblestone), muddy light trails

# Thoughts

I was a bit worried to try them immediately for the first time for a long distance of 13 miles but they proved to be amazing and I didn’t feel any discomfort throughout the entire workout.

# Size and fit

As expected they fit perfectly to my feet and I know that my preferred running shoe size is 28.5cm so PUMA’s EU44 is what I chose. I still have the same one thumb of space between my toes and the tip of the shoe but the latter definitely is tapered or narrow compared to others of the same size. Fortunately that detail wasn’t a problem at all during my run.

# Ride

The DN3s have a carbon plate and even though it had glowing reviews online I was still expecting one of these three things:

1. There will be foot pain after a few kilometers because of this plate the way I did with Saucony Endorphin Speed 3’s nylon plate;
2. The plate would be felt but overall will be as lackluster as Velocity Nitro; or
3. I will experience the positives that everyone claims it has.

As mentioned before I tried these for 13 miles of moderate effort (\~4:50-5:30/km) and overall it was comfortable and fun to run in. I observed that the narrow tip became more noticeable as I went faster and with more cadence but not to the point of instability especially on the wet surfaces and cobblestone paths on my route. I didn’t feel like I needed to adjust anything in my foot landing with this point but this might be something to consider for other people.

# Performance

I actually used them first for a 5km walk the day before and one major issue I felt was that the upper is a bit breathable so my toes (only the toe area) felt cold despite the thick wool socks I have on. I was going to wear two layers of socks for my run and I’m glad I didn’t push through because my toes never felt cold during the run (-2° to 0°C). I will take note of this in the summer if it feels warmer (or even sweat) with the same cotton running socks I use everyday.

To be honest I was expecting to feel the in-your-face bounce and responsiveness attributed to plated shoes on my first try especially coming from the non-plated, regular Speedgoats but there were only minimal as far as my experience. I believe that I have to break-in the Nitro foam up to 50km as some of the reviewers say to fully appreciate the technology.

On the other hand It was easy to change my pace and cadence depending on my mood throughout the workout and even though it is only 10 grams lighter than the Speedgoats, it was like night and day! I liked that they “disappeared” from my feet as I went faster and I didn’t have to do extra effort to change my form to support the speed so that’s a plus. The DN3s are fun because the tip encouraged my preferred form of fore and mid foot strikes! I would definitely choose these for speedier days when the roads are wet over my Asics Magic Speed 3s which doesn’t have the best outsole on the market.

Another positive point for me was the comfort wherein I didn’t feel my legs and feet fatigued after the entire workout. I actually expected this from new shoes but the DN3s didn’t let me down.

As for the grip, I don’t have anything else to add but praises for the consistent PUMA Grip on my routes including some light trails. This is definitely one of the best selling points of this brand and I hope they continue to innovate and improve on this technology.

# Durability

The shoes are still as good as new aside from the dirt from the light trails I went through. I will keep an eye for my next review in 500km or more.

# Overall

The DN3s are great and reliable speedy shoes for running on days when the weather outside is terrible. They can also be a trusted Swiss knife for daily, long and speed runs because of their lightness and comfort. I won’t recommend them for recovery because they tend to encourage faster cadence. Also I still haven’t experienced the famed responsiveness during my initial run but I hope I will after a few more workouts.

# Next steps

The shoes will be rotated with my Speedgoats throughout winter and it will be designated for long and speedy days of my base building plan. I’ve seen reviews up to 1000km so I plan to keep notes in the midway point to update everyone and finally the end of its life once I feel discomfort.",2025-01-12 14:47:48+00:00,36,27

1hzjjwe,RunningShoeGeeks,400km review of the Adios Pro 4,"I was lucky enough to pick these up at a presale mid October. And ive used them as my daily trainer ever since. Yep, my daily trainer. 

Im not flashy runner either. Just an average Joe, pounding the pavement every day. 45 years old, 5’7’’, 75kg. Usually cruise along at around 5:15-5:30minute km’s. Pushing up to around 4-4:30minute kms for short bursts when im feeling crazy. Generally running 5-10km a day.

Firstly, I absolutely loved the AP3. Ive run it nearly every day this year since I picked it up (up until I got the 4). Have gone through 2 pairs. Loved the firm ride. Sure the upper was a bit firm, the lacing not super comfy. But never really bothered me.

The Pro 4 is wildly different, as im sure you have all read, in terms of the upper and lockdown. Just super comfy. The nicest upper ive put on amongst all the race day shoes.

But im sure you know all that, and would rather know about how they are doing after 400kms.

Well, just great to be honest. 

Outsole - apart from being rather dirty, there is literally no wear. Like none. Whatever this new outsole is, it’s kinda indestructible. Ive run on a couple of rainy days, and there are no traction issues.

Midsole - still super bouncy. I’ll also note, I saw a post from a month or 2 back after berlin, where some marathoner posted a photo of their midsole, and it looked super squashed and creased after one marathon. Gotta say, I see nothing of the sort here. I have no doubt it’s perhaps not as responsive as it was when I first put them on, but really, they still feel great heading out the door. Im sure they’ve perhaps lost a step though, but nothing discernible.

Upper - upper is kinda dirty now. But still super nice. You might find that they get pretty sweaty. I wouldn’t say they were hot shoes, but I do find they soak up sweat pretty good.

The ride - these shoes really are fast. Meaning, they do tend to push you along and urge you to keep picking up the pace. Ive found trying to maintain a slow pace to be a little tricky at times. Before you know it, you’re cruising along faster than you had planned. Great for those days where you are keen to keep moving. Not ideal for the days where you feel like a long slow one. Id probably not recommend them for long slow runs, but they can certainly be used for them in my opinion. They are just shoes, they largely do as you tell them. 

In the beginning, I found holding a steady pace in the AP4 to be a lot harder to do than in the AP3. But im splitting hairs. I absolutely loved the ride of the AP3. Loved the firmness, and the instant feedback they gave. The AP4 is so much softer by comparison, that in the beginning I felt kinda sluggish when I ran in them. But the more I continued on, the more natural they felt. I think my sluggishness was more mental than real. The shoes certainly keep you moving. It’s just a very different ride to the AP3, which I had run in daily for months. So if they feel ‘off’ for you in the beginning, stick at it, you’ll probably come around.

They feel a touch more ‘unstable’ than the AP3, simply due to the bounce. But I wouldn’t sweat it. They are more stable for me than the MetaSpeed Edge Paris, which I just found too narrow. 

The AP4 feels a lot more natural under foot than the AlphaFly 3, which felt so blocky and mechanical to me.

The AP4 on foot, straight out the box feels like the show you were waiting for. It’s just whether you can keep it under control in terms of how fast you want to go.

I’ll probably mix up my rotation in the new year. Picking up something different to go on some longer, slower runs. But all in all, I think I’ll mainly stick with the AP4 for the majority of my runs.

I see a lot of people seem to be saving these for race day, perhaps due the price, and I appreciate that. But if you love wearing them, consider that you might easily get 500-600km out of them. And that might be more fun that saving them for the odd race.",2025-01-12 09:59:24+00:00,308,116

Since I bought a pair of Takumi Sen 8s and Adios Pro 3s for 50% off through the years every time I've popped into the Adidas Store at Brentwood Mall, I regularly pop in and there's a good chance there's a deal.

Was in the market for a daily trainer and picked up the Supernova Rise for 40% off, $120 after taxes. I didn't love them, so I went in for an exchange and saw the Adizero SL2; they weren't marked for sale or anything, I was ready to fork over the extra $40 or so.

# Thoughts

Disclaimer: this review will focus on their performance as a road (and minimal trail) shoe.

# Size and fit

The shoes fit me perfectly and I now know my size in centimeters in all brands. I am also familiar with other Hoka models like the Clifton and Rincon series and the Speedgoats had the same “feel” as those two so I did not have any complaints. Actually it is improved now because I used to only buy size 28cm shoes all the time and get pain on my forefoot due to the swelling during long distances which have been eliminated by sizing up by half.

I used both standard medium-thick cotton and thick wool socks on these depending on the temperatures and both fit perfectly by just adjusting the laces.

# Ride

The shoes perform the same as Cliftons for me in terms of fore and mid-foot performance wherein there is an average amount of cushioning that I have trusted Hokas over time. It has little responsiveness and do not expect it to wow you because it doesn’t have such additional technology in the foam. I would put it’s cushioning and responsiveness to be better than the flatness and dullness of Adidas Adizero SL and Asics Noosa Tri 15 but not as great as Asics Novablast 3s and Rincon 3s.

In terms of the weight at around 280g, I did not feel it as a disadvantage and I was able to do my workouts without discomfort. I stray away from heavier shoes like Brooks Ghosts and Nike Pegasus (both historically gave me shin splits and overall unhappy experience) but the Speedgoat 5s were great! To be specific I actually do not “feel” the heaviness while running in them so it hasn’t been a complaint.

# Performance

After running in various weathers and road conditions over the past few weeks, I am definitely satisfied as it was able to handle them. I also love that my toes never felt any cold from all my runs regardless of the time spent outside but I assume would be a downside when temperatures get warmer.

As for the grip I did not have any problems except for icy roads which I have accepted to need spikes (or to just go to another road).

I actually used these for everything in the past 300kms for all my workouts and they definitely shone in daily and long runs. Basically they do what they need to do as daily trainers - to support the runner and provide comfort in unconventional paths which I commend them. I also used them on speedier days (< 4:30/km) but they are not fast shoes so I had to do extra work but it is doable. The only thing that I felt holding me back on such days was the little to no responsiveness and I believe if they put the Speedgoat Vibram outsoles on Rincons then it will be perfect!

I like using them on recovery days too but sometimes I have to control my cadence and pacing because as I’ve mentioned, I do not feel their weight to really force me to slow down but it is not a problem.

Additionally never experienced having to break them in like other people but I suspect that my feet’s familiarity with Hokas had a contribution to this. They were good to go on the day I received them.

# Durability

At 300km I suspected them to gradually flat out like Cliftons and Rincons but they’re still good as new! As I’ve said, they have average cushioning and little responsiveness and the shoes still performs consistently with the same feeling and ride I’ve had from the first run.

The Vibram outsole doesn't have any distinguishable damage and the rest of the exposed foam only shows minimal wear. This is a first for me in Hoka shoes because at this point they usually have the logos in the outsole show signs of fading and the mid-foot starting to let its decreasing performance be noticeable.

# Overall

They’re wonderful winter shoes and I could not have asked for anything else! 300km and still looks and feels new is not what I expected from these but I am glad to have been proven wrong. My daily, long and recovery runs are covered without any worries of the cold and mud as long as they’re not drenched.

# Next steps

I am now in the middle of my Pfitz Base Building up to 60 miles per week plan and it will still be used for daily, long and recovery. However my Puma Deviate Nitro 3s are coming so I plan to use these for faster days and rotate with long runs.

I will continue using them up to 600km as planned unless I feel changes in the feel and/or discomfort that weren’t present before.",2025-01-11 17:23:38+00:00,21,15

1hyr35z,RunningShoeGeeks,Another Evo SL 25km review(ish) - not for me though ,"I'm very impulsive so when a mate sent me a screenshot of the Adidas Australia website and it showed they had these in stock in my size I thought what the hell. They weren't a shoe I was particularly interested in to be honest but Adidas' marketing and the hype they built won me over. 

Background: 30yo male, 65kg, midfoot striker, 5k 17:31, 10k 35:56

I've put 25km in these shoes which included a short interval workout totalling 12k (1km TT and 1min on/1min off intervals) and an easy run of 13k averaging about 5min/km pace.

I probably got caught up in the hype a bit and maybe expected too much from this shoe but it hasn't wowed me and I will actually try and sell to get a pair of Novablast 5 or another pair of Neo Zen's I think. 

The ride felt firm when compared to my Novablast 4 and Neo Zen's which are my other shoes that I'd currently run most daily kms in. I found the upper to be quite voluminous and felt like I really had to go tight on the lacing to get a good lock down (yes, they were the right size). This isn't aimed only at this shoe but for the love of God can brands just put gussetted tongues in all of their shoes. The sides of the tongue would keep folding inwards when trying to put these on.

The second run was actually after some rain and they performed about as well as any shoe in the wet, nice and confident on pavement but pretty slippery on tiling or asphalt.

It's clear a lot of people like these shoes but unfortunately, they just didn't feel good for me. I don't think there's such bad things as a bad running shoe these days, we just all have our preferences. People have told me that these can soften up over time but I'm honestly not willing to keep running in them over shoes that I know I love just waiting for them to maybe come good.

Repost so I can follow the rules correctly. 

This deal is back slightly more expensive than the white colorway from the other day using code ADIDAS50. Lots of sizes were available earlier with some still remaining. If it’s anything like the white colorway, these will restock throughout the day.

1hxwz4v,RunningShoeGeeks,Novablast 5 after 50kms,"About me: Male - 177cm - 81.5kg - 5km: 19:59 - 10km: 43:00 - HM: 1:35. KMs per week: 80-120. Midfoot-heel striker. 

Currently in week 2 of 26, building to Gold Coast marathon. 

Fit: TTS. A perfect fit in my US9. A nice roomy toe box which is really wonderful for my Morton's neuromas. No issue with those in this shoe. The jacquard upper has been nice and breathable, easy to get a good lockdown. Heel collar and ankle are plush. It's a really comfortable shoe. 

Outsole: Same as basically all ASICS trainers, pretty slippery on wet cobbles, but everything else is fine. 

Midsole: I was quite surprised at the rockered geometry and bounce in the midsole. I was expecting a firmer, more subdued midsole. The rocker is what I would consider fairly aggressive for a non-plated daily shoe. Makes that transition from heel to toe quite snappy and effortless. Rolls through nicely. The foam has definitely softened up beyond 30km, and has more of a sink in quality now. 

Use cases: For my block, I'm using this shoe for all of my easy and long runs that don't include any faster segments. For faster work in using the Zoom fly 6. The shoe is great for cruising and it looks after your legs better than most shoes I've used. I had no soreness or fatigue after taking them for 16km easy at 5:40/km. I haven't tried picking up the pace in them because that's not their role in my rotation. I actually prefer them to my Superblast which, though I enjoy, are just a bit firmer and noticeably chunky. 

I'm strongly considering grabbing the real pair as well to be a dedicated long run shoe, while these ones take the easy and daily runs. 

I can't compare these to the Nb4, because I never used them. Of the shoes I own, the foam and rude is most similar to the Triumph 21. ",2025-01-10 05:05:17+00:00,170,81

1hxa2bl,RunningShoeGeeks,Puma Magnify Nitro 2 - Review after 1090km,"About me: 5ft 8, 69kg.  5k 25min, 10km 50min, HM 1.51. Started running in January 2024.

I've been using the Puma Magnify Nitro 2 since July 2024.  They replaced a pair of Puma ForeverRun Nitro 2 which only ""lasted"" around 350/400km before they felt lifeless.

Anyway, these have been a great daily shoe - and from what i can see, fantastic value for money - i paid £80 for mine (and i brought a 2nd pair later for £91) - they always seem to be on sale for some reason.  I've run over 1090km in mine and I've decided to retire them.

The Good

Great Grip - Puma grip seems to be pretty phenomenal in all conditions - i've run them through summer, autumn and now winter in sun, rain, frost and mud and i can't remember a time when ive slipped or felt like i was about to fall.

Comfortable - for me, the shoe has been true to size (UK size 8) - extremely comfortable and never had any issues with my toes or heels.  The shoe seems to be padded in all the right places, toebox is fine for me, and its always felt plush.

Cushioning/ride/midsole- the Magnify Nitro has been springy and compliant, without feeling too soft - i'd say its felt more firm than overly soft.  For me, i feel as comfortable wearing them from 5k distance up to half marathon and sometimes it surprises me how effortless it feels wearing them.

Longevity - subjective of course, but they felt great up till around 800km - they started to lose some of the bounce after that, but still felt useable.  Even now, over 1000km, i feel they could still be used for 5km runs without feeling compromised.  I'm a heel striker, and some of the grip started peeling off around 700km - most of it has come off on the outside edge, but i dont think it has compromised the grip at all.

The Bad

Heat retention. - the shoe felt a bit hot during the summer - man, my feet were pretty sweaty and pongy after a long run - although, in the Autumn/Winter, this hasn't been a problem and probably been a plus!

Overall - I've loved running in this shoe - its just something i could pick up and run.  The low cost of the shoe and how long they've lasted, represent great value for money.  I've brought another pair to add to my rotation (along with a pair of Deviate Nitro 3 and Puma Magmax Nitro).

1hwl82h,RunningShoeGeeks,361 Furious ET - go fast or go home? ,"Purchased from 361sport.com for AUD190.
Ordered 08 Dec 2024, shipped 17 Dec, arrived 06 Jan 2025.

Caught my attention because it seemed to have a; super foam, carbon plate, mid-stack, decent aesthetic.

(after 2hrs of warm-ups, cool-downs and progressive recovery runs so far)
Initial overall thoughts; 
A more democratic, relaxed Adios Pro 3. 

Went with the suggested half size down (EU40.5 instead of my usual EU41) and there was still a good thumbnail width of room.
Similar to length to Boston 12 EU41.

Fit is very snug. Almost race fit.
Midfoot - forefoot width is quite narrow but that may be due to having to downsize.
It's a chore to get the foot in & out. Need to loosen laces properly.
I can't use Lightfeet (padded) socks in these without sidewall pressure on my pinky toe.
Lightweight socks only (Steigens, Creepers work well). 

Upper is secure but comfortable.
It's easy to get the upper wrapped around the midfoot well.
They come with both serrated & normal laces. Good length, not ridiculously long but plenty to runner's knot (unnecessary).
Once you get the laces adjusted, the upper holds well and doesn't sag or stretch. 
Heel counter is a very stiff but doesn't protrude & the ankle is well padded all round.
No issues above the big toe or eyelets causing rubbing.

Midsole feels like a crossbreed of the AP3 and Cielo X1.
Rebound is noticeably slower than the AP3, but there is a lot more travel in the compression & release like the CX1.
The AP3 rewards punching down and ticking legs over faster.
The plate in the ET is actually quite low in the forefoot, less than half the stack compared to the heel below the plate.
From touch-down it is interesting as a forefoot striker as I can feel/hear the different sections loading up.
It has a smoother transition from fully loaded to toe-off and the plate/rocker is less abrupt and intrusive because the shoe is much more flexible.

Weight is a hair more than the AP3, but definitely less than the Boston12.
Most likely due to the thicker outsole.

Outsole LOOKS like the new CPU/RPU stuff, but it could be just clear rubber.
No issues with traction but it's bone dry here atm in the aussie summer. 
Will have to update 100km or so in.
Can be a bit slappy at the start of a run, but warms/softens up after about 3km or so.
Picks up dirt very easily, but heck, it's the outsole...

Build quality is...excellent?
Nevermind that there are very few acceptable colourways. 
I can't find a fault with materials/stitching/gluing yet. 
One tongue has a 'MIRO + Hummingbird' logo and the other has a very hard to read '361' logo.
The laces came twisted? I had to spend 20mins undoing and re-lacing them. Does that count?
I don't like the exposed lateral carbon plate 'wings', but I understand it's a marketing choice aka gimmick.

Otherwise, this shoe coasts from recovery to 5K pace.

Going downhill (usually my nightmare) is actually a dream in these?
Loading up the heel and rolling through is bloody gorgeous.
I did notice that my cadence was significantly slower in this shoe (172 instead of 176) for my usual tempo pace (4:45/km)
Not sure if this is detrimental? Legs feel way better than usual considering I did hard hills yesterday.

Questions for the future;
What does ET stand for? Endurance Trainer?
Not sure if I'd take this up to half marathon distance or beyond.
Not sure if the ""CQEXTREME3 Lite"" foam is the same as the stuff in the Miro Nude? ",2025-01-08 14:17:38+00:00,36,29

1hwczq1,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Mach 6 first run,"Back again with some first impressions of the Hoka Mach 6, my very first Hoka.

I honestly wasn’t planning on getting new shoes until at least a few months to run my ForeverRuns to the ground (currently at 400km), but I came across this deal of Mach 6 for around $65 and thought to myself screw it, I’m getting a new daily trainer lol. Here are some of my thoughts after my first few runs with my Mach 6.

Bit of background I’m a new runner with average daily pace of 6:00 min/km with ~40km of weekly mileage currently training for a HM in May—175 cm 87kg midfoot-heel striker 175 average cadence.

**Fit and Feel:**
Luckily, I watched and read a lot of reviews here and decided to get a half size up (US12; I usually wear an 11.5), and it seemed like a good fit. A bit narrow in the midfoot, but that didn’t bother me too much. It reminded me a lot of the Velocity Nitro 3, which I decided not to get because my feet overhang a bit due to the narrow platform. The same issue is here with the Hoka, so ideally, try it out in person and go for the wide version if needed.

Walking around indoors, I was surprised at how soft and bouncy they felt. The stiffness of the midsole due to the midsole stack vaguely reminded me of the Superblast, a shoe I absolutely love, so I was excited to try it out.

**The Ride:**
Did some interval workouts and a moderate 10k at my target HM pace with these. Started running and the shoe immediately felt considerably firmer. The bounce was not as noticeable as when I did the walk test, but I generally prefer a firmer shoe so it wasn’t really a problem for me. But definitely not the ride that I initially expected.

Heard a lot of praises for the rocker, and I have to say I agree it’s pretty good. Not too aggressive but really helped encourage me forward during my run. Picking up the pace felt easy and enjoyable. It’s cushioned but firm and very light which I appreciate. Overall, I really enjoyed how this shoe felt.

**The Everything Else:**
I have no complaints about the upper. I think it’s comfortable and breathable especially for me in the warmer climate. I didn’t find the forefoot volume to be cramped, but keep in mind I went half a size up in these.

The outsole, on the other hand, is not as grippy as I’d like. I ran on damp roads and pavements and felt like my feet struggled for grip a bit when picking up the pace. Not to the point of being dangerous, but noticeable enough that I got subconsciously annoyed by it. The Puma grip has ruined my expectations.

**Final thoughts:**
Overall, my first impression is positive, especially for the price. It is light, fun, comfortable, and surprisingly stable. I think this shoe will serve me well for my daily runs and speed workouts. It might be a bit awkward for recovery runs, but I’ll have to try it out. ",2025-01-08 06:00:24+00:00,64,29

1hvmput,RunningShoeGeeks,FYI: Wide sizes and shoe midsoles/uppers,"***~~TLDR:~~*** *~~If I shoe only comes in D and 2E widths, safe to say the 2E midsole is no wider and there is simply more fabric on the upper. If the shoe comes in B, D, 2E~~* *~~as well as~~* *~~4E widths, the 2E probably has a wider midsole and more fabric on the upper, while the 4E has the same wide midsole as the 2E (but with even more fabric on the upper).~~*

# EDIT: I was wrong! Please see u/LongjumpingHamster's comment [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/comments/1hvmput/comment/m66oodz/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

I was trying to buy the new Saucony Triumph in a 2E width, but like always I had no idea whether the ""wide"" size meant that the actual shoe last/midsole was wider, or whether they simply added more fabric to the upper.

I chatted in on Saucony's website, and although they assured me that the midsole of the 2E size was wider, comparing the insoles I could tell this was not the case. However on the 2E size of the New Balance 1080v14's I ordered, I the insole was marked ""WIDE"". This was the exact same ""WIDE"" insole that came in the 4E size with the 1080v14's, meaning the only change between the 2E and the 4E was likely more fabric up top. However it was apparent that the 2E had a different insole/last from the regular D width.

So my best guess at the sizing between these two shoes would be:

# Saucony Triumph 22   (D and 2E only)

|SIZE|Midsole/Outsole Width|Upper Material|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**D**|Medium|Medium|
|**2E**|Medium|Extra|

# New Balance 1080v14   (B, D, 2E, 4E)

|SIZE|Midsole/Outsole Width|Upper Material|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**B**|Medium|Less|
|**D**|Medium|Medium|
|**2E**|Wide|Extra|
|**4E**|Wide|A Ton|

This sizing pattern would make the most sense in terms of reducing production costs, and is what I imagine most companies probably follow. Not sure if this was obvious to everyone else, but I it wasn't to me. Also if I'm wrong feel free to let me know.",2025-01-07 08:07:06+00:00,32,15

1hvhe4o,RunningShoeGeeks,Adidas Adios Pro 3: The Finale,"My first pair of Adios Pro 3 has finally yee’d their last haw. They started life as the White Tint/Coral colorway but have turned an accessible beige color from miles upon miles of sweat, rain, dirt, and general abuse. An entire section of sole is missing from each shoe in the same spot, and the Continental logo is no longer visible on either. 

Parting with these shoes is bittersweet. It’s not that I’ll miss the shoe’s performance, as I have another broken in pair in Lilac, the brand new Solar Red pair (right) on standby, and my new AP4s are sitting in the box having arrived today. There is a sentimental factor at play. These were the shoe that opened my eyes to what a Supershoe should be. 

My final run in these shoes was last week’s long run in my marathon training block, 18 miles. The shoes still felt good and gave me no issues during the run, but were quite a bit softer, less defined, and more dull feeling than when they were new. I finally have beaten the Lightstrike Pro in these shoes into submission after ~250 miles. This may not sound like a lot of distance to wear out a pair of expensive shoes, but I’m 233 lbs and 6’5 so $1/mile at MSRP isn’t a terrible deal for the both measurable and perceived performance boost.

If I see these again on a closeout site I’m buying four more pairs.",2025-01-07 02:44:58+00:00,211,62
1hvchqn,RunningShoeGeeks,ASICS Novablast 4 - Long Term Review ,"
A-little about me

I’m 30 years old, 6ft tall and around 83kgs. I’ve used the Novablast 4’s as my general daily shoe for the last six months or so and have only not used them when I’m running easy miles or longer runs past 12k or so.

The shoe

They are a fantastic daily option especially if you can get them in the sale currently now the Novablast 5 has been released. 

However I have seen a lot of reviews on this thread touting how they have taken them to 800kms and beyond that they last and last etc.

Although I totally agree they are a great shoe and I still recommend them to friends, I think there are a few elements that haven’t been covered that well in other reviews. So I wanted to pass this on for others who are looking to pick them up so they can bear it in mind when they are looking at if it’s the right shoe for them.

The good

Lightweight 
Bouncy 
Comfortable 

They are in the sweetspot between being affordable (if you can say any running shoes are affordable 😂), lightweight and responsive with just enough cushion to be a true all rounder. You can genuinely use them for all kinds of running, which isn’t something you can say about many shoes with so many now becoming design to excel in one area as part of a rotation.

The bad 

Traction/grip
Foam compression for heavier runners
Longevity 

I have run 340km’s in my pair and they have really struggled in the last 100kms or so with grip at higher paces in particular to the point where I am now not confident wearing them for certain runs. When it’s wet (which in the UK for me is pretty much every other day) forget it grip is no existent and a serious issue. The frustrating part about this is that it wasn’t great initially but the wear on the outsole has clearly had an impact and I was expecting to get far more than 300km out of them. This might just be bad luck and the areas I land in just don’t have much grip left but not an issue I’ve had with other shoes this early into using them. I’ve also begun to struggle with ankle and knee pain after I run in them. Which mean I will probably have to retire them to shorter runs only if it continues which again given the mileage they are at I am surprised by. 

TLDR

Still a fantastic shoe but for heavier runner especially those in wetter countries I don’t think it’s the best choice for an everyday trainer if you want to get more kilometres out of a shoe than 300/350. Still a great buy for most people if you can get it on a heavy discount but in my opinion better for lighter runners and warmer climates..

Finally, this is my first time posting a review, so any feedback on what’s good/bad is welcome!",2025-01-06 22:56:12+00:00,69,74
1hvbhnn,RunningShoeGeeks,Bmai Jingtan Fly,"I enjoy trying things out of the ordinary, and in the sea of western brands I had heard good things about many running shoes from Chinese brands. I have dived in and researched many brands and models. Like many there was an initial turn off sometimes because of styling, but predominantly because of the unknown. Once I overcame those fears I made the leap to try something new, something different. To see what else is out there.   

Introducing the Bmai Jingtan fly. Let me start by saying thatbthis is a really good looking shoe. The colours pop & the asymmetry looks quite cool.   

This is a marathon shoe which sits in Bmai's range a rung below their flagship racer. It is still used by professional runners in major events and has had many top 100 finishes. Read on below, but I would class it as a very adaptable shoe that would suit a large percentage of runners.   

Size - True to size in US sizing. US 8 shoe weight of 199g.   

Upper - Comfortable jacquard mesh upper with seems to have good breathability with large holes in the forefoot upper. The tongue is also a soft jacquard mesh which is not gusseted, but I had no issue with movement.   

Midsole - 'Boomfly' Aliphatic TPU midsole 36mm heel, 29mm forefoot stack for a 7mm drop. On step in, this is the softest midsole I have owned. Softer than the Adidas AP3, Puma DNE3, Puma Magmax or Asics Novablast 4. But most importantly for me as a mid to forefoot striker, is the softness in the forefoot. So often I find midsoles are softer in the heel and firm up in the forefoot, but this sole has both girth and forgiveness in the forefoot which is so welcome for me.   

Plate - Full length carbon plate which is on the soft side, the shoe still has considerable flex. This continues the comfort feeling of the shoe as there is no harsh plate stiffness, yet it does provide assistance in performance.   

Outsole - DSP (diamond star particle) outsole. Not sure exactly of the compound, but it feels grippy and sounds like CPU when running.   

Fit - Snug fit through heel and midfoot, great lock and heel comfort with inner padding around heel. Roomy in forefoot width. It lacks a bit of arch support but due to the softness i didnt find it troublesome. Inner sole is removeable. Laces are notched which almost locks them in like a runners knot, although I still used a runners knot.     

I've taken this on a 7km run and it was a dream. So soft, yet definitely a fun, bouncy, propulsive ride. I put it through 4:20-5:30 km pace and while perfectly good at slower pacing, the more you put into it the more you'll get out of the sole and plate. My effort and pace to heart rate seemed of a similar ilk to when I run in my AP3's.   

I'm 65kg, so maybe this is how heavier runners feel about midsoles that feel firmer for me, and maybe this shoe would bottom out if you're a heavier runner.   

Delivered to Aus for total $127 AUD. An absolute steal for a shoe of this performance and quality. This can be a great racer or trainer, that will probably fall into the tempo trainer category for me. This is a shoe that I believe will suit many runners.

1hur875,RunningShoeGeeks,Brooks Glycerin Max Initial Review,"About me: 6’ 48 yo male, 180lbs. 3:15 Marathon, 1:30 Hm, 39min 10k, 18:30 min 5k, 5:26 mile PR. 40-60mpw. Current shoe rotation: Nike AF3 (race), Hoka Cielo X1 (long/tempo), Hoka Mach X2 (tempo/daily), Hoka Mach 6 (daily/tread) and Saucony Endorphin Pro 3 for tempo/track. 

Wife bought me these as a Xmas present as an easy day/recovery/walking shoe while I work myself back from some nasty shin splints. 

FIT:  TTS (11.5) with an extremely plush upper. The tongue is fat and padded, laces work perfectly (no need for runners knot) with a wide toebox and plenty of wiggle room without feeling baggy. I do feel like the arches are a little higher than what I’m used to but they seem to be breaking in ok (see ride/midsole). The step in feel is extremely plush and exactly what I was hoping for in this type of max stack shoe. 

RIDE/MIDSOLE:  I’ve taken this shoe to about 40 miles so I think I have a good feel for its intended purpose along with my personal experience. I’ve done a handful of runs in the BGM ranging from tempo, easy long runs, and hills. The ride while is surprisingly springy while feeling quite nimble, despite its heft weight in my size 11.5. 

My first run was a 6mile mix tempo run ranging from 7:00/mile to 9/mile. I was actually quite enamored with how the midsole firms up at faster tempos in the forefoot. It’s not as fast or efficient as a tempo shoe like the Mach X2, but certainly can hit quicker speeds without issue. 

I also have used this shoe for some moderate hill runs with mixed paces from 9:30/mile (steep inclines) to fast efforts downhill (6:00 -6:30/mile) which again was a pleasant surprise given the range for such a heavyish max stacked shoe. 

POSITIVES: Super plush and comfy ride that can handle recovery/easy paces with some nice pickup. The DNA tuned foam is really surprising and a departure from other Brooks standard EVA foams which have grown a bit long in the tooth (similar to Hokas older offerings). It’s good to see Brooks innovate with shoes like this. Walking in this shoe is bliss for my feet. 

NEGATIVES: I did experience a mild hotspot on the left arch for the first 10 miles or so, but it seems to have gone away with time/break-in. Something to watch as I’ve heard other reviewers have a similar experience. Although the shoe doesn’t feel heavy on foot, it could benefit to lose a few ounces. I’ve run in both versions of the Superblast (slappy/not for me), and think Brooks could have a better, more versatile version of the SB2 with a little weight reduction. The midsole/ride is that good. 

VALUE:  I’d say if money isn’t an option, than this is a great shoe. I’ll be using it for easy days, long runs, and walks. At $200 (I peeked at the receipt) it’s a little pricey. That being said, there’s a ton of other shoes that can fill this void. For me, I’m really enjoying it. 

OVERALL:  The Glycerin Max is a keeper on my rotation. I needed (wife says wanted lol) an easy day shoe that feels good on the feet for recovery yet pick up the pace. This shoe is extremely comfortable, and depending on your paces and fitness level, and shoe budget, this could be a great all rounder.

1htelyd,RunningShoeGeeks,Mizuno Wave Rebellion Pro Natural review & the Mizuno brand,"Realizing this shoe is a niche shoe because of its limited release, I do would like to share it as I believe Mizuno is having a return with exciting releases coming up which people perhaps should not sleep on and I simply love this shoe enough to review it. 

I discovered the Mizuno Rebellion Pro natural in this community, credits to:

https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/comments/1dqixpq/mizuno_wave_rebellion_pro_natural/

https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/comments/1e2981a/first_run_mizuno_wave_rebellion_pro_natural/

Reading this sparked my interest as I was looking for a speed run and race shoe having a super daily trailer in the Mizuno Neo Vista en previously the Wave Rider series. That being said, I would like to keep my shoe rotation simple and small just consisting of a daily trailer and a speed/race shoe for now. As many before me shared it seemed Mizuno their shoe technology came to a stall mate for a couple of years, or at the very least no big innovations seemed to me made. Although the Mizuno Rebellion Pro and Mizuno Rebellion Flash were very interesting shoes, they always felt a bit niché needing a specific drop and a bigger shoe rotation to justify them. With the release of the Mizuno Neo Vista they really hit the ball out of the park, when I tried the shoe on it was a very fun shoe to run on the high stacked bounciness made runs very enjoyable and easy to do without the legs feeling beat up afterwards. Yet, although it is marketed as being able to do speedruns which I believe it can do for many people. It felt a bit lacking the that real “kick”of a race or speed shoe because of that exact bounciness even when the plate gives it an accelaration. This made me look for a shoe in that specific role. I preferred to stay in the same brand, partly because of sentiment but also rationally believing staying in the same brand can make creating rotations of shoes easier as the shoes can compliment each other by using the same technique and companies creating their own shoe class or rotations already by their different shoes. 

A little bit of background information about my running profile:
- Gym 4 days a week
- Started running last year
- Runs 4-5 times a week mostly following a Garmin training to improve speed and condition 
- Prefer running 5 to 10km with the occasional half marathon distance
- Pace currently comfortably between 5:00/km - 6:00/km
- Length: 1,74, weight 84kg and aged 40
- Previous shoes: ASICS Gel Kayano, ASICS Novablast, Mizuno Wave Rider, Mizuno Neo Vista

Well, that is enough about me, back to the more important part, the shoe:

I bought the shoe in one of the Mizuno flag store in Osaka. I also visited another smaller branch, but that one didn’t seem to have this shoe on display confirming the limited availability not only abroad by also in Japan itself. 

The Mizuno Rebellion Pro (Natural) is marketed as a racing and fast tempo shoe designed for runners looking to maximize speed and responsiveness. Featuring Mizuno’s ENERZY Lite foam, it provides a springy, energized ride that’s ideal for fast-paced training sessions and races. The shoe’s minimalist, breathable upper keeps the weight down without sacrificing support, while the high stack height and responsive midsole make it perfect for explosive propulsion with each stride. Where the Rebellion Pro and to lesser extent the Rebellion Wave requires a specific running style, which is landing mid foot. This alternate version, the Rebellion Pro Natural makes it more approachable for a wider public to run in, the later one is the category I fall in as running in the Rebellion Pro (2) felt a bit unnatural for me when I tried it on.

I will write my own personal opinion comparing it with the shoe I use as my Daily Trailer, the Mizuno Neo Vista and how I think this works really well for my simple 2 shoe rotation.

Performance: The Rebellion Pro Natural excels in speed workouts and race scenarios. This came apparent when I did my first run in it, it felt I was flying. Directly on my first run I broke some PR’s with quite a margin. Going fast felt really natural (pun intended) and easy, the shoe propelled my way more forward comparing it to the Neo Vista which also has plate can tends to be springy at higher speeds. I was able to set my fastest time I run to date and I felt there was still enough in the tank to keep going. Of course the question that I ask myself here was it the shoe itself, a placento or just the stars aligning, regardless, I was happy with my new PR and the comfort of running fast in these shoes and I am looking forward to my first race in these. After the first run my legs felt still pretty good to give it another go. 

The Fit: Really liking the snug sock like fit of the Neo Vista I was a little bit worried that the fit would be a step backwards, but quite honestly the upper is quite thin and holds my feet good in place. So got no complaints there. 

Traction: The traction really was great and noticeably better for me comparing it to the regular Mizuno Rebellion Pro and Flash or the Neo Vista which has a higher stack. The run was after a bit of rain and every step and turn made me feel comfortable to keep the amount of speed I was carrying.

In Summary: The Mizuno Rebellion Pro Natura works for me allowing me to run with faster speed , delivering unmatched lightness and bounce for those faster miles. In contrast, the Neo Vista is my reliable option for daily training, with a comfortable, stable design that holds up over long distances. Together, they create a balanced rotation that covers both speed, training and recovery needs.

My closing thoughts about the Mizuno brand I would like to share: I feel the brand is still underrated in the west, partly this is done by Mizuno themselves without innovating for a wider public, yet they seem to be right on track again with their new line up of shoes. So if you have a chance to try some of their shoes you might be pleasantly surprised. Also, reading a few comments on this sub of expectations of exciting 2025 releases in combination with new recently exciting releases make it seem the Mizuno brand seems to be back on track and quite honestly I am looking forward what is to come which hopefully will not hurt my wallet to much.

1htdbnh,RunningShoeGeeks,ASICS Superblast 2 - 400km+,"I purchased the ASICS Superblast 2 last year and have now used them in my rotation for over 400km. 

I honestly loved the Superblast 2 from the moment I started using them and still do. They are by far the best daily/long run trainer I’ve used so far in my running journey. 

I’m a 39yr old male and have been running for at least 20 years on and off. My main sports used to be Muay Thai and BJJ but due to an injury last year I had to give both up and got back into running around April. Since then I’ve been running steadily and fluctuate between 3-5 runs a week. 

My current times are:
5k - 19.32

10k - 40.23

1/2 Marathon - 1hr 37

Marathon - 3hr 35 (ran over 10 years ago)

The main factor for me with the Superblast 2 that sets them apart from my other shoes is that they make running so much more fun. The mid-sole has a great balance between cushion, bounce and responsiveness and can handle everything from easy runs to faster paced tempo runs. I wear a 7.5 and they fit well, the upper is light and I get a good lock down with a runners loop. 

I’ve been on multiple runs with the Superblast 2 and been struggling, then when I up the pace slightly the shoe seems to give me that extra bounce I need to keep going. I find that the Superblast 2 is the shoe I reach for for the majority of my runs and I’ll 100% be buying another pair. 

After 400km I still feel that they have life in them and I think I’ll assess this again after another 100km. The shoe itself is in great shape after 400km, with only a little sign of wear. I’m around 66kg so on the lighter side, but I’ve still be impressed on how well they have held up. 

The other shoes currently in my rotation are:
Hoka Bondi 8 - I used them for recovery runs.
 
Adidas Takumi Sen 8 - mainly used for interval and track runs. 

ASICS Metaspeed Edge+ - I use these for timed 5k/10k runs. 

I’m currently training for the Edinburgh Marathon in May and I am seriously considering  using the Superblast 2 as my race day shoe because of my experience training with them. They are expensive, but I feel like the extra cost is reflected in how great a shoe the Superblast 2, I can’t recommend them enough. ",2025-01-04 12:24:08+00:00,241,58

1hss1gz,RunningShoeGeeks,Adios Pro 4 first run,"Sizing: TTS, a touch more snug lengthwise than the AP3.

The AP3 was one of my favorite super shoes. Aside from the scratchy upper, I struggled to think where Adidas could improve it much. After an initial 6 mile interval run, I can say the AP4 is a completely different experience. Whether this is good for your needs or not is going to be runner dependent. First off, the upper in this is sublime. Highly comfortable, no pressure points, easy to achieve a good lockdown.

Where this really throws a curveball is the new formulation of Lightstrike Pro. This is now the softest supershoe I have tried, up there with some of the squishy FuelCell compounds from the earlier SC Elite models. To Adidas’ credit, the energy return is still there, maybe even a bit peppier. At 10k pace for my intervals (6:50/mile), the shoe sang and beckoned to go even faster. During the cooldown periods I could really feel a deep squish that could provide stability challenges for some. The AP4 is decidedly less stable overall versus the AP3 because of the softer foam, but at quicker paces seems to become more stable. I don’t know that I’d recommend these for marathoners over 3:30 unless you have strong ankles. The interesting thing about this compound is that I could almost feel the rods in the shoe as the foam has that much give.

The new outsole is immensely sticky, a bit noisier than the old Continental outsoles used to be but I’m happy to deal with this for such a fun shoe. Lastly, in my size, the AP4 is about 20 grams lighter than the AP3. This is awesome work by Adidas, it’s right there with the Vaporfly and Metaspeed Paris series now.

1hsp45v,RunningShoeGeeks,"Adios Pro 4 - Full Marathon Review (Slow Runner, Philippines)","About me: i’m training for a full marathon (42km), not short distances, and i’ve been dedicated to running since March 2024. My times are:

5k: 25 minutes

10k: 55 minutes

Half Marathon (HM): 2 hours 2 minutes

Full Marathon (FM): 4 hours 46 minutes (only once so far).
i do mid-foot landing when running at tempo pace, but i tend to heel-strike when i’m extremly tired. i’m a cadence runner, with an average of 180 steps per minute in Zone 2.


Full Marathon Experience (December 2024):
i used these shoes during my full marathon in early December with an open target time. i can confidently say that these shoes gave me a lot of comfort and protection from start to finish. it was my first marathon, and my goal was simply to finish without injury, and the shoes didn’t disappoint. From km1 to km24, i was able to maintain a steady pace, but from km25 onwards, i started to lose it. i think the heat of the weather and my nutrition plan (which didn’t work well because i wasn’t used to Manila's climate) were factors. But with the shoe, it felt like i wanted to propel forward, but instead of giving me that extra push, the softness of the shoe absorbed the force, so my effort felt wasted. My finish time was 4:46; i was hoping for 4:30.

Shoe Durability:
the shoes did get wet from km32 onwards because i was pouring water over my head to cool off in the heat, and i accidentally got the shoes wet.

25KM Year-End Run (Zone 3 Heart Rate):
since i ran in the province, where it’s usually windy and less smoky, i was able to maintain a pace of 5:55 to 6:10 per km.

Same Experience as Marathon:
similar to the full marathon, once i hit the half marathon distance, the shoes absorbed my energy rather than helping me bounce forward. i believe these shoes are designed more for runners aiming for 3-hour marathon times. However, they’re still suitable for those of us aiming for 4 hours or more, but don’t expect a lot of propulsion once you pass the half marathon mark unless you have very strong calves. if you’re looking for support and comfort and just want to finish the race without injury, these shoes are a good choice.

Fit:
it’s better to try them in-store. For the Adios Pro 3, i wore a size 7.5, but for the Adios Pro 4, i went with size 7. i prefer the snug fit. it’s really important to try them on yourself.

6KM Interval Test:
i also tried these during intervals at 6KM, and i got a blister from the shoe counter rubbing against my foot. But to be fair, the socks i was using were not great, so i think this shoe is particular about the type of socks you wear.

Comparing to Adios Pro 3:
if you want a snappy feel and have no issues with the upper part of the AP3, i think the AP3 is a better choice. it gives you that extra push in the latter part of the race, though your feet will definitely hurt. My longest run in these was 32KM.

Comparing to Edge Paris:
the Edge Paris wins hands down. it’s light, and when you want to pick up the pace from Zone 2 to Zone 4, it doesn’t disappoint. i haven’t tried it for more than 25KM yet, so i can’t say how it feels when you’re exhausted. To summarize: if you’re a slower runner, towards the end of the marathon, the softness of the shoe will absorb your energy, but you still get full protection.

Future Test:
i have a 35-38KM run this Sunday, and i’m undecided on which shoe i’ll use. If i choose the AP4, i’ll update this post to share if my experience is similar.",2025-01-03 15:34:25+00:00,116,41
1hsnetf,RunningShoeGeeks,Adidas Adios 9,"M | 20 | 51kgs | 170cm

I’ve been looking for a good speed session shoe, and I was surprised to see the Adios 9 in stock at our local Adidas store. the day after it was displayed, I immediately bought a pair in women’s size EU 40 2/3. took them for a quick fartlek session (4:02-4:17m/km 1 min hard and 4:34-5:06/km recovery) and here are my thoughts.

Fit: I got the Adios 9 in EU 40 2/3. while EU 40 is my usual size, I found that my middle toe didn’t have enough space in the toe box when I tried it on, so I decided to go half a size up. the fit in EU 40 2/3 is perfect not too tight and not too loose. the toe box offers a good amount of space, the lockdown is excellent, and the upper feels very breathable.

Pros: the Adios 9 feels light, fast, and effortless with its smooth turnover. it provides a great fit for my feet and looks stunning in the Ekiden colorway. Plus, the upper is absolutely phenomenal!

Midsole: the full-length Lightstrike Pro midsole is very responsive and bouncy. while it feels firm initially, I’ve read reviews suggesting that it softens up over time.

Outsole: the new LIGHTTRAXION outsole delivers incredible grip, even on damp surfaces. I tested it by running over some wet sections of the track and was amazed that I didn’t lose traction, even when making contact with those slippery areas.

What I dislike: the laces are the one thing I dislike about these trainers—it took me a while to achieve the right lockdown. however, using a runner’s knot made the fit feel solid and secure. I just wish they had updated the laces for a better experience.

Verdict: The Adios 9 is a great choice for runners who's looking for a lightweight, great turnover, responsive shoe for speed sessions. Will use it more so the foam can break in, still at a mileage of 25km. And I actually enjoy walking in this shoe. ",2025-01-03 14:16:41+00:00,128,54

1hsj8hh,RunningShoeGeeks,EVO SL - Initial Thoughts.,"This post is my initial review and a comparison to other shoe in my rotation, Endorphin speed 2 and Ascis Superblast.

I tried these last week.

I go the ones in black, The shoe look beautiful.

Edit : Adding sizing.

I am size EU 45.5 in Salomon, Nike and Asics but EU 46 in Saucony. So I went with EU46 in EVO SL and that seems to be the right decision as I had just enough room in the toe box and no heel slippage. 

The shoe feels quite heavy compared to the Endorphin Speed 2, which is my usual workout shoe. ES2 is snappier, lighter and has better upper. Upper in EVO SL felt bulky to me.

This is my first time running in LS pro midsole, it felt softer than the Power run PB but Saucony is more snappier.

Took them for 22km higher aerobic zone run around 4:30min/km with picking up the pace at the end.

I didn't feel any discomfort during the run but felt underfoot pain in the left foot, which I never had during previous weeks.  
Outsole Grip is questionable, the outsole grip didn't hold up the road when I was doing my pre-run stretches. I didn't run on any wet surface but it is a strict Road shoe I don't even try it for easy trails.  
This is where the Endorphin speed comes handy with the superb grip, I often take it to trails for my fartlek or tempo runs on trails.

I do all my easy runs on trails including some fartlek runs, ES2 for track workouts and Superblast or ES2 for specific long runs on the road.  
Superblasts got better quality materials compared to EVO SL, I would pickup them for upper aerobic zone runs and ES2 for tempo runs instead of EVO SL. So I don't really know where these will fit in my rotation.

For everyone eager to try these shoes, no need to jump on the hype train, wait it out. There are better shoes already available, EVO SL is a fine shoe but didn't amaze me after my initial run.  
I will try to do few more runs in coming weeks and post my impressions.",2025-01-03 10:06:27+00:00,37,39
1hsimdv,RunningShoeGeeks,Day 2 running with my Novablast 5,"

Comparing to yesterday, the shoe felt way more natural and reactive, my legs were dying at around 6km but the shoe is so responsive it continuously gives me energy and i can go even faster. Since i was young i always think Asics is just an average small brand but this shoe completely changed my mind even I’ve been wearing Adidas and Nike my whole life. They have improved a lot

Also, I normally hate bouncy shoes because it’s always unstable on my feet and hurt my arch, but this one is an exception. Even my feet is pronated and flat like a tyre but i don’t have any issues with this shoes, definitely recommended.

I feel like the sweet-spot of this shoe is around 5:00min/km pace, if you run too slow it actually wants you to go faster due to the mechanics ",2025-01-03 09:23:03+00:00,41,34
1hsb8ds,RunningShoeGeeks,TYR Valkyrie Speedworks 100 mile review,"This is my first shoe review, so bear with me! I bought this shoe during Black Friday along with two others in an attempt to replace my Endorphin Speed 3s. I ordered my usual size (12) and for reference, I’m a midfoot striker.

When I first tried them on, I wasn’t sure I’d like them. The ankle collar felt high, and the heel seemed unstable. However, those concerns disappeared as soon as I started running. The foam feels very similar to PWRRUN PB, but I prefer the upper on this shoe compared to my Endorphin Speed 3. I’ve used it for everything from 5:15 mile repeats to slower recovery runs, and all I can say is wow—it has exceeded my expectations for every type of run.

The upper is minimal yet secure, offering a snug fit through the midfoot and heel while providing a surprisingly roomy forefoot. It’s not as spacious as something like the Topo Specter but feels more comfortable and form-fitting overall.

This shoe shines in uptempo workouts and even on tired, easy runs. The nylon plate delivers a smooth, efficient toe-off while maintaining excellent energy return from the 40mm Pebax foam. Like the Saucony Endorphin series, TYR has crafted a versatile, fast, and energized shoe that performs across a variety of paces.

I can honestly say this is my favorite do it all shoe I have owned so far. My only wish is that I had been able to purchase the model with the black upper instead of the white and blue. I will most likely be purchasing the carbon elite model and another speedworks when they restock.",2025-01-03 02:01:22+00:00,31,24

1hs3fd0,RunningShoeGeeks,Yet Another Evo SL Review (Big runner/easy pace),"Yes I know we are all tired hearing about the Evo SL. I’ve reached 75 miles today and feel I have a great understanding of how this shoe fits into the market. 

Background: I’m 6’3 ~200lbs fairly muscular build as I’ve exercised in weight lifting for the last 2-3 years. Over the last 3 years I’ve biked a fair amount roughly 3 times per week weather depending. I started running about 6-8 months ago and currently log around 40 miles a week mostly easy going pace (9-10 min/mile). 

Use case: Primary daily including easy runs approaching 10 min/mile. Infrequent tempo runs of 7:30/mile. Longest run of 12 miles in this and usually do around 7-10 miles. 

Wear: Virtually nonexistent but keep in mind I’m not used to such a white shoe so I never take it out unless it’s ideal weather. 

Fit: 12 in everything mostly, 12.5 in this as 12 was too short. Semi wide foot and needed to go size 13 in SL2. NB 3 was my previous daily and I always hated it after 50 miles. 

Running experience: BOUNCE. I’m a mid foot heavy striker and get so much feedback out of these it feels effortless. The rocker is quite aggressive and unavoidable when walking around however as a mid foot striker on easy runs I never feel sucked into the rocker aggression at all. Without plates I don’t feel guided into going faster than I want to. This is why I view it as a highly versatile trainer. On my tempo runs I utilized the rocker and it felt right at home. As an easy pace mid striker there was plenty of foam under foot which I never felt in the mid section of the nova blast. High cadence is a breeze with the bounce and lightness of the shoe. 

Dislikes: laces were never used for a run. Felt like the type of laces I would wear if my goal was to cut off the circulation to my foot. Bought alpha fly dupe laces on Amazon and they are fantastic. Upper is a great fit for me and very breathable, I have zero complaints about it. Tongue has to be adjusted until it’s just right or you’ll have a bad time as it’s easy to have a wrinkled part on the side. As long as you pay attention strapping them on it’s fine. 

Overall: I’m gonna wear the hell out of these and when they finally release fully I’m gonna get a backup pair without question. Slow paces as a bigger runner have never felt easier and more protective. Tempo runs utilizing the aggressive rocker placement are a breeze. My takeaway is the versatility of this shoe as again, I never felt pulled into the aggressive rocker and felt I could slow down and mid foot strike with high cadence easily. The foam is unreal and I can’t wait to run in them each time I lace them up. ",2025-01-02 20:23:45+00:00,121,50

1hrebns,RunningShoeGeeks,"First run in the brand new Hoka Bondi 9, plus some comparison with other max cushion shoes on the market","About me: 33M, 5'8"" and 193 lbs, shoe size 8.5. Lift weight 6-7 times a week and run 3-4 times a week. I run for fun and don't usually have an exact time goal in mind, just kinda run by feel and enjoy the good vibes 🤘

Note 1: Some of these shoes are in women's size 10 because I just like their colors better.

Note 2: The Asics Superblast 1 and 2 won't be included in this post since I feel like they're not direct competitors with the Hoka Bondi 9.

Note 3: These are MY opinions about the shoe. We all have our own preferences so please be respectful and civil towards each other in the comment session 🙂

TLDR: Bondi is back baby!!!

I was a big fan of the Bondi 6 and 7 but when the Bondi 8 came out, it was a very disappointing shoe for me. The Bondi 8's midsole was firm and the upper was very narrow in the mid foot area, I didn't really enjoy running in the Bondi 8 at all. The best word I could describe the Bondi 8 is ""Clunky"". However, I'm happy to report that the Bondi 9 is a much better shoe than the Bondi 8 and it's heading back to the way the Bondi 6 and 7 look and feel with a modern slightly softer mid sole. 

The first time I put the 9 on I was surprised by how light it feels on food and then I was more surprised when I found out it actually weighs slightly more than the 8. With the 8, I can definitely tell it's a heavy shoe because it's bottom heavy but not with the 9. Hoka did a great job balancing out the upper, midsole and outsole. The upper is now slightly wider in the mid foot area so that's a plus for me. With the 8, it was so narrow in the mid foot area that the medial side of my foot kept pressing against the firm midsole. Even though it didn't cause any blister or anything, it was uncomfortable to run in and it took a couple of miles to get used to that feeling. I'm so glad Hoka fixed that. Breathability is to be determined but it was 50 degrees when I ran this morning and I definitely felt some breeze as I was running.

The midsole is a much needed upgrade! It's definitely softer than the previous models but I do have to warn you that if you're expecting it to be something like the New Balance More v5, you're gonna be very disappointed. It's still a very cushioned shoe but slightly on the firmer side. There was one shoe that I kept thinking of as I was running in the 9 and it's the On Cloudeclipse. The run feels very similar between these two shoes: the midsole is very cushioned and you feel very protected but it also firms up a little and give you a little bounce back when you pick up the pace, the midsole definitely feels more alive at a faster pace (which is something I also notice in the Hoka Mach 6). The rocker also helps keep you in the rhythm and provides a much smoother ride. I thoroughly enjoy this improvement, and while I'm planning on using the 9 for easy and normal runs, I can definitely see myself running a few short speed sessions in it as well.

The outsole is again to be determined. No signs of wear and tear on my first run and if it's anything like the previous models, it should last you a long time.

Now for comparisons, all the shoes (except for the Bondi 8) in the picture are great cruisers so you can't really go wrong with any of them. That said, it really depends on your preference at this point. I will rank these shoes in different categories from ""least"" to ""most"" and again, these are just my opinions based on how my foot feels in these shoes so just take them with a grain of salt: 

- Softness:

On Cloudeclipse > Hoka Bondi 9 > Saucony Hurricane 24 = Brooks Glycerin Max > New Balance v5.

- Responsiveness:

New Balance v5 > Saucony Hurricane 24 > Brooks Glycerin Max = On Cloudeclipse > Hoka Bondi 9

- Versatility:

New Balance v5 > Saucony Hurricane 24 = Hoka Bondi 9 > On Cloudeclipse > Brooks Glycerin Max

- Value:

Brooks Glycerin Max > New Balance v5 > On Cloudeclipse > Hoka Bondi 9 = Saucony Hurricane 24 

Overall, I really appreciate what Hoka has done with this iteration of the Bondi and if you're a fan of the Bondi line, you should definitely give this a try.

1hqzb8e,RunningShoeGeeks,Initial thoughts: Under Armour Infinite Elite,"It’s not a secret that Under Armour is not a well-renowned Running shoe brand. They make great running apparel but not great running shoes; that much can be generalized for most people in this subreddit. I wasn’t really planning on getting these shoes specifically, but I WAS in need of new easy day/recovery shoes as I recently just retired my More v4 after more than 500km. It was on sale on the Under Armour SEA website for quite a lot actually, so I basically just said F— it and got the pair for only 65usd. 

It’s an alright looking shoe to me. Not too shabby, but definitely not premium looking as well. I definitely do understand why a lot of people say that they look cheap, especially when you pay the SRP of 160usd for these.

Now my initial impressions on these shoe are based on 4 runs which accumulate to just about 50km in total. 

Upper: the knit upper is definitely on the cheaper side. It does not stretch much and I think it was blended with a lot of cheaper material (plastic) that’s why it feels that way. However, it does a great job of locking down your feet and it has a very accommodating fit. People with wide feet will love these. I am someone who is not concerned at all with breathability so it’s not a problem to me, but I do want to share that the upper is not breathable at all. Might be good for people running in colder weather, but not for people who prioritize breathability.

Midsole: this honestly blew my mind. The midsole feels like styrofoam, kind of like early iterations of Adidas boost. But underfoot and while running with it, it feels exactly like the Saucony Triumph 20. The old iteration of PwrRun+ that is on the firm side but gives you enough pop to have an energetic experience underfoot. The days where people complained that Saucony didn’t have a max cushioned easy day shoe because the shoe they were marketing for it (Triumph 20) felt more like a daily trainer. This is exactly how this chunky midsole felt like. I am predicting that this midsole will not loosen up even when it goes past 200km and will just maintain this feel which is I guess ok for people who want some responsive midsoles, but not for people who will look to use these for purely easy day runs. More on this later

Outsole: the outsole is hella thick, which greatly contributes to the weight. I have no effin idea why they call it “ThinWeb” rubber. I will tell you now, it’s not thin at all LOL. Looks very durable and honestly gripped very well. It’s worth noting that I tested these while it was raining and it gripped wet pavement/gravel really really well. Not quite Pumagrip level, but maybe closer to Asics Ahar+ grip. I can easily predict that the outsole will outlast the midsole and upper of this shoe.

Personal opinions/thoughts: honestly, there is only one drawback of this shoe for me, and it’s the weight of the shoes. My size 9.5 US mens weighs at 11.5oz (325 grams) which is very very very heavy for a running shoe today. Now even with that kind of weight, this would honestly not be that big of a deal to me since they are marketing this as an easy day shoe that’s supposed to be used for those slow and steady runs where you need tons of cushion. However, the midsole is not built for easy runs IMO. The Saucony Triumph 20, which is one of my favorite daily trainers of all time, is not an easy day shoe for me. It’s too energetic of a shoe. The midsole of the Infinite Elite, while looking like the chunkiest boy from your 5th grade class back then, is very energetic. 

The entire ride experience is so confusing because you have all these pop and energy return from the midsole but your feet are also getting tired because of the weight of the shoes. It doesn’t behave like an easy day shoe but you can’t pick up the paces or run long with it as well. It sits in a very weird place that I kind of don’t know where to put it in a standard running shoe rotation.

Should you buy this shoe? Probably not, especially for the 160usd srp. But Under Armour running shoes go on sale by a lot (well, at least here in the Asia Pacific). The running shoe world is so expensive nowadays, even for your easy day and/or garbage mile shoes. We all need those pair that we don’t really like wearing but have to for mileage purposes. I do have to say though, Under Armour got some things right in this shoe, especially the outsole. I am getting more and more optimistic that Under Armour can eventually catch up on the big dogs of the running industry sooner rather than later.",2025-01-01 08:59:33+00:00,46,22

1hqviwp,RunningShoeGeeks,Nike Zoomfly 6 First Run Thoughts,"M | 25 | 5'9 | 148 lbs



I got this pair because I thought I needed a tempo/faster shoe for my rotation. I am currently using the Novablast 4 and Superblast 2. I also wanted to experience running in a carbon-plated shoe and decided that this would be a great entry point for my level of running.



Having ran with just the Novablast and Superblast all year, rocking this pair felt different. It felt less cushioned. However, for a carbon-plated shoe, this is certainly the most comfortable I have tried on. I also thought the toebox was a little bit narrow for my liking but I believe it just needs more breaking in. 



I decided to attempt the Coros Running Test which consisted of a 5 minutes of warmup **(12'19"" / mi)**, 25 minutes @ marathon pace **(9'55"" / mi)**, 3 minutes @ 10k pace **(8'42"" / mi)**, 3 minutes @ 5k pace **(7'35"" / mi)** and 5 minutes of cooldown **(12'25"" / mi)**. This test would also give me an initial feel for the shoes across different paces.



For the easy paces, I felt the shoes were just alright but not optimal for such pace. I would personally prefer not to run long slow distances with this. I also felt that this shoe begs you to pick up the pace.



For the faster paces, this shoe was where it shined the most. The shoes were very responsive. I would also like to point out how the shoes forced me to run with proper form and cadence. Compared to my Superblast and Novablast, I thought this shoe was less forgiving in faster paces. I felt l have to run ""correctly"" to fully get its benefits (which is totally worth it)!

  
I definitely enjoyed my first run with this pair and I'm now looking forward to my tempo/speed sessions. I am also planning to run with this for my 5ks, 10ks and upcoming half marathon this year. 

  
Happy New Year, everyone!",2025-01-01 04:23:14+00:00,140,27
1hqtfnn,RunningShoeGeeks,Asics Superblast 2 review after 55 miles,"**Total distance ran:**

55 miles (90 km)

**Type of runs:**

Easy runs (7:50-8:20/mile), steady runs (7:10-7:40/mile). All on roads.

**My profile:**

Height: 6’0”

Weight: 160lbs

Weekly mileage: 65-70 miles (\~110km). 1:26 HM and 2:57 FM

Strike Type: Midfoot

**Overview:**

I impulse bought these at a marathon expo in early December, figuring I could use them as part of a base build in between marathon training blocks. 

So far, I've taken them on a handful of easy and steady runs between 7-10 miles. My first run was a 7-mile recovery run the day after a marathon, and there was zero ground feel, which was exactly what I was looking for that morning. Two runs have been in the rain, and the outsole grip was excellent. I'd also note that the wide midfoot/forefoot area has left me surefooted on cambered, pothole-laden roads. 

I know some folks use the Superblast 2 for marathon pace and faster runs, but I can't see myself using them for anything other than easy/steady runs. They are very large and noticeable underfoot and I prefer nimbler shoes for workouts (e.g., Adios Pro 3, New Balance SC Elite v3). 

**Positives:**

* Fantastic wet weather grip
* Stable platform

**Negatives:**

* Not especially versatile (at least for me)
* I wear an 11.5 in every shoe, and these are a little shorter than I would like. But given how sizable the shoe is, I don't know that I'd want to size up. Instead, I just wear thinner socks. 

**Worth buying?:**

Since I spent $200 on them, I certainly plan on getting at least 400 miles out of them, but I would not buy them again.

New year I promise!) and generally not very fast (21:05 5k PB ran today in the Sen 10). I’ve never had road shoes that weren’t Nike but I got a great deal on the takumi sen 10s and heard they’re good for intervals, which I’m prioritising at the minute, so thought they’d be worth a shot.

Went out in them today to try them out and actually ran a 2 second 5k PB. However, I’m still trying to make sense of them because they didn’t actually feel fast despite running a PB. I’ve never tried super shoes but have owned a few Nike carbon plated shoes and ran once in a pair of adios pro 3s, all of which felt fast from as soon as I put them on. All propelled me forward and felt really fast. I didn’t get that whatsoever in the Sen 10s, but they’re clearly quite quick as I got a PB.

I also felt a bit of discomfort in them in the left shoe  which I’ve never had before. Almost felt like I could feel the rods through the insole, and still have a bit of pain now. I’m hoping this’ll improve as they’re worn in a bit more though.

1hqex4r,RunningShoeGeeks,Adidas Evo SL - 150km review,"Hi all,
A quick review of my Evo SL after I put 150km on them.
I already made a first run review but to recap: they fit my foot perfectly (wide forefoot low volume foot). They fit TTS (like the SB2 for reference). Since I got them I ran almost everything in them (except a couple of runs in the AP4, btw they fit half size too short vs the EVO SL). They softened a bit between 40 and 80km Id say but since then they didnt move.

They are by far my favorite shoes of all times. They can do everything, from very slow (6min/km) to very fast (2’20min/km on 200/300m repeats). The biggest distance I ran with them is only 16km but they didn’t change at all on those 16km. I wouldnt be afraid to take them to HM (above I have no clue).

I swapped the laces as you can see, cause the original ones suck. The tongue could be gusseted and the continental outsole is slippery on ice and leaves/mud. Otherwise very good grip.

All in all, excellent shoe and Im more than happy about them.

I have a slightly wide foot, but because the Rebel v4 are so wide (I already have a pair), I figured it's a pretty safe bet. 

Went for a 10km tempo this morning and zero issues.

M27, 5’11/160lb, 1:17/2:50 HM/FM training for Boston ‘25. 41 miles on these shoes so far in a size (US) M11. 

**Background/Context:**
I love an Adidas eBay shop deal and when I saw these for ~$60 in that Megaman color scheme, I figured they were worth a try.

I have really only ever clicked with the Boston, and while the Evo SL is strongly on my radar, the scarcity made me opt for these instead. Unlike a lot of people, the Boston upper never gives me problems, but I had hopes for a more upscale experience at the top of the Supernova line. I’ve been looking for a do-it-all shoe since my Endorphin Shifts bit the dust and recent purchases (Superblast 2, New Balance 880v14, Salomon Spectur 2) had left me a bit disappointed in that respect. 

My first run with the Prima ended up being a semi LR with some pace drops at the end (mostly a result of the headwind becoming a tailwind) and I was really surprised. Not only was this shoe smooth (insulated but not compliant in a mushy way, which was my problem with shoes like 1080v13), but it felt like I could shift gears with comfort and ease. In suboptimal weather, I found myself on autopilot pretty quickly. 

In the days since, I’ve used it on a variety of runs from paces around 8:30/mi down to 5:50/mi and the shoe has never felt like a limiting factor. For what basically seemed like a throwaway model by Adidas marketing standards, this has quickly become something I reach for before turning to the vaunted Superblast. They fit my wider forefoot comfortably, the rods (non carbon, of course!) are set up in a way that I feel lends some stability and response to the ride, and the traction has been decent even in slurry conditions. For the price I got them, I’m incredibly satisfied. ",2024-12-31 00:47:19+00:00,129,38

I put it on and it just felt comfortable immediately. Snug like a glove no pressure points. The laces are comfortable (ahem looking at you Boston 12 and those awful laces). 
The ride is just fun. Lots of cushion but you don’t sink into the shoe. Springy but not as much movement as an alpha fly. It feels like the perfect super trainer for me. Fun effortless feel on my first easy 5 miles. I did a few strides and they held up fine. I’m not sure I would reach for these for a track workout but I think a tempo or long run they would be great and certainly made an easy 5 feel like a dream.  

One caution the shoe feels a tiny bit short. They still felt fine to me but I have a lot more room in the toes in other shoes like Boston 12, Pegasus plus, alpha fly etc. since I’m not racing in these I think they will be great but I bet some people will need to size up. 


Other shoes I like to give you context since this is a personal thing. 

Love the Boston 12 but I hate the upper and literally curse the shoe every time I put it on. (But I still put it on!) The laces are very finicky. It’s probably too stable of a shoe for me as I am an underpronator but I’ve not had any issues and I do like that shoe even if putting it on is awful. 

Pegasus plus - one of thr best looking shoes on the market in my view and so comfortable. But I find them so squishy I only pull them out for recovery runs. I don’t like to run fast in that shoe and I don’t like to run on the treadmill with them, but when my legs are tired they feel great. The fit is amazing and the upper is really comfortable. Just too squishy for my taste unless I’m recovery then bring on the squish! 

Alpha flys - love for racing and I tend to run better mechanically in the shoe landing more on my forefoot. The alpha fly in the same size has a lot more room in the toes box which is nice for racing. 

In summary - The zoomfly 6 feels like a great companion to the alpha fly and a really fun shoe. The upper and laces feel luxurious coming from the Boston 12.  Watch the sizing - you may need to size up. And I’ll need to experiment with faster and longer runs to see how I like the shoe. Right now it’s my favorite daily trainer and made my easy 5 miles feel effortless. I’m a fan.

1hpvbli,RunningShoeGeeks,Nike Vomero 17 Review (After 400 miles),"Profile
* M 140lbs, Mid/Forefoot striker
* Paces: Recovery- 7:20/mi+, Easy- 6:40/mi-7:19/mi, Long run- 6:20/mi-6:30/mi, Tempo- 5:30-5:36/mi, Threshold- 5:15-5:20/mi, 5k RP 4:55/mi

TL;DR  The Nike Vomero 17 is a daily workhorse that I was able to use comfortably and consistently for all types of runs. While mainly used for easy runs, shining between 6:40-7:00/mi, they still felt great and responsive on short (3-5mi) tempos (5:30/mi) on roads and even some tempo intervals on grass. While I’m at 400 miles on my 2nd pair, I expect them to last at least 200-300 more miles before I need to replace them.

Upper:
The upper is a plastic-feeling engineered mesh, which I was initially worried about, but felt great on foot. It was surprisingly very breathable as well with no issues in the summer months. However, my toes were wishing for a warmer upper in the winter months. The toe box did not give me any issues, however I can’t vouch for those with wide feet having narrow-to-medium foot width. The upper has also held up impressively well on both pairs that I’ve had, while also maintaining its color very well through mud and rain over the course of several fall and early winter runs. 

Outsole:
The Vomero 17s outsole gave me no issues grip-wise in all sorts of conditions. I’ve worn these through pourdowns and on snow-covered flat trails and have never had an issue with slippage. While the full coverage of rubber on the outsole might add a little bit of extra weight, It is worth it when the extra grip is considered.

Midsole:
The very reason which made me buy the shoe in the first place. The dual-density midsole containing pillowy ZoomX on the top half and a slab of firmer Cushlon 3.0 on the bottom was something I had to get my hands on. Whatever Nike did, it worked. The firmer foam on the bottom and the built up sidewalls of ZoomX around the heel give the shoe the stability it needs to be a daily workhorse, while the ZoomX on the top layer gives the shoe premium responsiveness and bounce you would expect out of a speed trainer or racer, combining to give the runner a stable and responsive experience for their daily miles as well as strides and tempo work.

Best Uses:
In my opinion, this shoe shines best as a daily workhorse for long runs and daily runs. While it is comfortable enough and stable enough to withstand hundreds and hundreds of miles, it also has the responsiveness you need to carry you through long runs at a faster pace and/or with pickup efforts.",2024-12-30 19:32:15+00:00,88,39

Context: M50, 154 lbs, 5'9"". 1:42 HM, 21:30 5k, forefoot striker trying to be more of a midfoot striker.

I have a somewhat wide forefoot and a regular/narrow heel. I tried a bunch of trail shoes that felt too narrow in the forefoot. The Peregrine was too tight for sure. I tried all of the Saucony Edge/Rift shoes. Some too narrow, some too unstable. Salomon were not comfortable for me either.

Meanwhile, in the road-running arena I found that Boston 12 and the AP3 fit me better with the more accommodating toe boxes. So when I found a great sale on the Adidas Terrex Speed I snatched it up. I loved the feel of the Lightstrike Pro in those, however they were too sloppy and seemed long. I went down from my ""10 in every size"" to a 9.5. Those felt too small. And in both I was concerned about the minimal upper both not supporting me enough and the collar digging into my foot (as happened some from the AP3). 

Enter the Agravic 3, a more ""normal"" offering with more padding around the collar. Given that I'm no racer on the trails and given a good sale price, I picked them up and have been very pleasantly surprised.

The upper is TTS and comfortable. I'm not thrilled about the skinny laces, but they seem to work well enough and don't come untied particularly badly. I haven't needed a runners knot for lockdown (where I have in other shoes). I have some Cascacadias that irritate the side of my big toes and that is not an issue with these.

The Lightstrike foam doesn't have that ""wow!"" feeling, but feels nice with a reasonable compliance on the trails. They are stable for me. 

The traction seems good in Colorado (note that I don't run in mud). Wear has been minimal so far (I've only had 4 or 5 miles on roads).

The tongue moves around some, but not in a way that causes discomfort. Way easier to deal with than the tongue in the Boston 12s or the AP3s. Even less hassle than the Evo SL tongue.

I've been surprised that I haven't seen these come up in discussion more (or the other Terrex offerings much either). These seem like a very nice option for everyday use on the trails, especially if your foot shape gels with the Adizero norms. I would definitely consider them again after I wear these out.

I see some of these in closeout colors are on sale right now FWIW.",2024-12-30 04:41:23+00:00,37,11

1hova5p,RunningShoeGeeks,Adios Pro 4 - 30 km out of the box,"
It’s going to be tough, really tough. Does the new Adios Pro 4 stand a chance with me? Straight out of the box, for a run over 30km? After all, it’s supposed to be a marathon shoe. But let’s be honest—things aren’t looking great. Why? I love the Adios Pro 3. For me, it’s THE perfect shoe (tied now with the Evo SL, which makes for a killer duo). I currently own seven pairs of the AP3—some with over 700km, others over 500km, and one still untouched. And I love them all. Even the ones with the highest mileage still perform beautifully.

The AP3 has the best midsole in the game for me—not too firm, not too soft. Perfect for cruising, marathon pace, and even a bit faster. And I’ve never had issues with the upper, either.

But now, here comes the Adios Pro 4 (which probably explains all the Adidas hype lately—they’re releasing the shoes right now). The reviews so far? Well… okay. But honestly, I was expecting more after the AP3. My biggest fear? That perfect midsole might have gotten a lot softer. As a predominantly heel striker who appreciates some stability at the end of a marathon, that’s a potential problem. And yep, the new Lightstrike Pro is soft. Walking in it, it feels significantly softer. Running? More on that in a bit.

A bit about me:

I’m just over 190cm tall, weigh around 75kg, and have a marathon PB of 3:16. My half marathon PB is 1:28. Adidas shoes have always fit me well (by the way, what happened to the Adizero Tempo line?). My current rotation includes:

AP3 for long and fast runs

Evo SL, probably for the same soon (I’m using it every second run lately)

Saucony Tempus, Saucony Xodus Ultra, Asics GT-2000 12, Nnormal Tomir 2 for Zone 2 runs, depending on terrain


First run in the AP4:

The goal: over 30km at ~5 min/km pace (my last marathon was only four weeks ago, so I’m not going all out). The first few kilometers feel faster than expected and surprisingly good. But—this shoe is loud. Every step goes plop. I’ve only experienced this before with Nike shoes. The AP4 even gives off Vaporfly vibes. The foam feels a lot like ZoomX, in my opinion. And honestly, I liked the Vaporfly 2, but only for distances up to a half marathon—beyond that, it was too unstable for me. The Vaporfly 3 felt great initially: lighter, more stable than the VF2. But over anything beyond 10km at half marathon pace, my feet couldn’t handle it (I’ve also tried the Alphafly 2—absolute disaster for my running style).

So, is the AP4 an Adidas Vaporfly?

No. At first, there are similarities, sure. And for the first 8km, I keep convincing myself why Adidas shouldn’t have changed the shoe. But here’s the twist: I keep running 10-15 seconds faster than planned without even noticing. Sure, there’s still the plop plop plop and a softer feel than I’m used to, but that familiar Adios Pro vibe starts kicking in. I think it’s thanks to the Energy Rods. With the VF3, if you don’t hit the plate just right (remember: heel striker, odd running style), things get uncomfortable fast. The rods, on the other hand, seem more forgiving and adapt better to different running styles—or at least that’s my theory.

I throw in a kilometer at half marathon pace (~4:15 min/km) mid-run. Feels great. The biggest issue today wasn’t the shoe but the weather—at -3°C, breathing was tough. Otherwise, I could’ve gone even faster.

Speaking of weather, let’s talk about the outsole. Massive praise here! It features minimal Continental rubber with a new material, but the grip is insane. I’ve never experienced this kind of traction on a road shoe before. Even on icy gravel sections, I had zero issues. No slipping—just smooth running. Fantastic.

The upper? It’s getting praised everywhere, but since I never had issues with the AP3’s upper, I don’t have much to add. One minor thing: there was some rubbing on one heel where that little triangle decoration is. This might be because I trusted some reviews and went with a US13 instead of my usual US12.5 in Adidas shoes. My regular size probably would’ve worked fine. The US13 has a bit more toe room, so I had to lace them tighter (I have narrower feet). For what it’s worth, I always use a runner’s knot.

Conclusion:

I didn’t expect to enjoy the AP4 this much. If you have fresh AP3s or can snag a pair on sale, go for it! But the AP4 holds its own—and then some. I can’t speak to durability yet, but after the first run, there are hardly any signs of wear. The AP4 runs like an Adios Pro, just softer but far from as unstable as the AP2 (which I couldn’t get along with at all).

I’ll likely run my next marathon in the AP4, but first, more testing to be sure.

1hoa6bs,RunningShoeGeeks,Adidas Adizero EVO SL after 34 miles ,"**Profile:**

* 35M 165lb, Forefoot striker
* Paces: Recovery 8:00+, Long Run 7:20, FM 6:45, HM 6:15, 10K 6:01, 5K 5:45
* Fanboy of Lightstrike Pro
* Hater of Adidas Uppers 

**Runs:**

* 17mi Long Run at 7:20 w/Marathon Pace picks ups (in the rain)
* 8mi Recovery run at 8:15-8:30 w/strides
* 9mi Track workout with 400s and 800s at 5K pace+

**TL:DR** The Evo SL a well-priced and highly versatile lightweight neutral trainer with an excellent responsive foam that wants to run fast

**Upper:**

The upper is almost always a struggle with the adizero line for me. I had to return the Boston 12 and the Prime X Strung 2 because of upper issues. On the rest of adizero shoes I've run in, I've always put up with the upper, but never loved it. It's safe to say that the Evo SL is the best adizero upper I've tried, though that is a low bar. It's certianly not Saucony, New Balance or Brooks, but it's solid. It's got a very wide toe box, almost giving Topo vibes. The tongue is not gusseted but locks into place fine. The lace are, as always with adizero, total garbage. 

**Outsole:**

In direct contrast to the upper, the adizero line is famous for excellent outsoles and this shoe is no exception. Adidas was clearly optimizing for weight with this shoe, so the coverage is a thin layer. But, as will all continental rubber, I expect this to be both durable and exceptionally high performing. Zero issues on my 17mi LR in the rain. This is in the S-tier with puma and skechers. 

**Midsole:**

A giant slab of lightweight, highly responsive, well cushioned TPEE. What more is there to say? If you buy this shoe, it's because of the midsole. 

**Best Uses:**

IMHO, this is a very versatile shoe. It worked well for recovery, the long run and track intervals. There are very, very few shoes ever made that I can say this about. You could absolutely make this a one shoe rotation if needed. That said, it's not ideal for recovery or track intervals (or racing). During my recovery run, I found myself wishing I had more stack and a more comfortable upper. During my track intervals, I found myself wishing I had less stack and a more aggressive toe off. For me, the sweet spot of this shoe is moderate efforts with some pace pick ups. 

And I must add that I REALLY dislike how Adidas have limited the releases of this shoe. Super annoying and I hope other brands don't start doing more of that.

1ho97fz,RunningShoeGeeks,First Run in Adios 9,"Picked up the new Adios 9 from Adidas (140€) and they arrived today. Took them for a spin right away.

About me:
31 years old, 68kg, HM PB 1:20:02

Size:
Went with the size Adidas suggested based on previous shoe purchases and it fits well. Would say TTS for my narrowish foot. I found the toe box to be rather roomy.

Upper:
Feels great, like a sock. When running, I didn't really notice it anymore. The tongue is soft and short, just how I like it. My only recent experience with Adidas uppers was the Boston 11. Compared to that the Adios 9 is much softer and hugs the foot a lot more.

Midsole:
Very comfy and soft underfoot. There is a bit of a bevel on the outside of the heel which makes heel striking a bit wonky. You also notice this when standing. The stack height is relatively low but I never felt like I was bottoming out if that makes sense. There was always a soft, plush feeling underfoot.

Outsole:
Felt fine in cold and dry conditions, but hard to extrapolate.

First Run:
I was a bit pressed by time so it was going to be a quick one on my 5.5km loop. Went out by feel on the first km and really noticed that the shoe wants you on the mid-/forefoot. Went out at ~4ish min/km Pace, top End of zone 2.
I love how light the shoe feels on your feet. It just becomes one with your foot. It doesn't feel like it's actively pushing you forward, but just gently helping by pushing you towards a forefoot strike.

I ended up running a pretty quick 5km at a relatively low HR, so it seems the shoe has a bit of a punch compared to, say, a Novablast 4.

Final takes:
Seems like a fun companion for shorter, quicker sessions. I bought it for some local 5k and 10k races, as well as faster trainings, but i could see this going up to a half Marathon in distance if you can be on your midfoot for that long.
Based on this one run, I find this to be a good road-analog to the nnormal Kjerag in terms of feel, which is what i was hoping for. They are both somewhat minimal, lightweight shoes and they have a similar dit imo.

Definitely looking forward to more runs with this one.

TL;DR
Dan for the first time in the Adios 9 and it seems to be a minimal rocket for shorter stuff. Upper is great, and it seems a good, if not great, value.",2024-12-28 16:29:40+00:00,176,22

First run in these bad boys. 2 miles at a fairly uptempo pace (for a big slow guy like me anyway). Just got them as a Christmas present. 

Fit: My normal size is US 10.5 wide. I got an 11 standard. Toe box feels plenty roomy. I laced up tight but there is still a little heel slip. Will be doing runner’s loop next time.

Feel: I got these shoes because I wanted something lighter and slightly faster feeling than my daily driver, the Brooks Glycerin 20. I think these accomplish both very well. The ride is springy and felt very natural at the slightly elevated pace I was going today. The outsole had a nice tacky feel out of the box, but dust clung to it pretty quickly. Even after a little dust, I had no problems with grip. Upper is very breathable and I had no issues with hot spots whatsoever.

Only thing I didn’t love was how the heel to toe transition felt while walking. I’m a midfoot striker and didn’t have any problems when doing anything faster than a walking pace.",2024-12-27 20:18:49+00:00,205,81

1hm8bqn,RunningShoeGeeks, Novice Runner Review (AP3 > AP4) ,"https://preview.redd.it/b8wdpp8a129e1.jpg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5fec1e2b0584b798901f19a1ccd0876dc4d4ca2

TL:DR: I prefer the AP3, but many/most people will like the AP4.

Note: I’m a slow amateur runner. 5k times between 25-29 mins. This is my personal opinion and experience, not an objective, expert review.

**Soft**

* The AP4 is soft, too soft for me. It feels a lot like the Nike Vaporfly, but the forefoot of the AP4 sinks in more. I prefer the firmer feel of the AP3. It feels faster and more stable.
* The AP4 feels light on foot, but the softness makes it feel heavier/slower while jogging compared to the AP3.
* The soft forefoot while running causes my toes to go slightly numb. I had the same issue with the Mizuno Neo Vistas.

**Stability**

* The AP4s feel unstable to me. The AP3s are stable for me, even on the track. The forefoot flair on the AP4 is significant, but my foot sinks into the foam unevenly. It’s like the outside of the shoe is stable, but my foot is unstable inside the shoe. I suspect a more advanced athlete with better form will do fine in the AP4s.

**Upper**

* I can feel the heel collar on the AP4. It is slightly irritating with a hard plastic edge. The AP3 feels unnoticeable on my foot.
* Other than the heel, the uppers feel similar to me. I have zero issues with the AP3 upper and laces.

**Rocker**

* The AP4 has a lovely rocker feel. While walking, it feels similar to the Hoka Cielo x1. However, while running, the softness of the heel and forefoot makes me loose some of the rocker sensation.

**Loud**

* The bottom of the AP4 is squeaky on smooth surfaces and has some muted click noise when running. Drives me nuts. Not as loud as the infamous Nike Next% Tempos though.

**Size**

* Sizing is interesting. My toe looks to be in the exact same spot on both the AP3 and AP4 in size 7.5. But the AP4 feels shorter when jogging. It might be a size-up situation.

**AP4 Personal Use Cases**

* Walking
* Easy Jog
* Warm Up/Cool Down

1hlo4o2,RunningShoeGeeks,SC Elite v4 - Hope for the 4E feet?,"For the past couple of months, my RMT did some activation work on my feet that resulted in them growing from a 2E to a 4E width. As a result, the EP3s I was using for my workouts and long runs caused me significant soreness on my big toe joint that forced a last minute purchase of the SC elite v4s two weeks out from CIM - the only super shoe with a wide version. 

My ideal fit is a 10 4E - with this shoe, the equivalent fit with this shoe was a 10.5 2E. When I tried them on, the shoe fit width wise, but was too long length wise. The 10 2E was too narrow, so I had to make the former work somehow. 

I ended up shoving some socks at the heel cup area (1st photo) as makeshift heel inserts. The lacing was a bit tricky with the short tongue but it surprisingly worked out well - length wise, it not fit perfectly. Tested them out on a 36km LR workout - no issues. The socks did not slip out! 

I used these shoes at CIM two weeks ago and walked away with a huge PB (3:30!). Shoe felt comfortable and yet still propelled me onto my midfoot-forefoot when I started to tire. The makeshift inserts slipped a little in the shoe, but did not fall out entirely and kept my feet secure for the entire race!

So, runners for 4E feet that struggle to find a good fitting super shoe - consider going up a half size in your 2E equivalent in the SC Elite v4 and use some thin socks as a makeshift heel insert to adjust the length. You'll have to do some fiddling but it works! ",2024-12-24 22:33:49+00:00,52,17
1hlktll,RunningShoeGeeks,TYR Valkyrie Elite Carbon 20 mile early review,"Background: 5’8”/172cm, 140 lbs/63.5 kg, 21 year old male. D width foot with low arches. Midfoot striker at easy paces and forefoot at faster paces. Beginner runner that started structured training late October but have been strength training for just over 5 years. Currently using Garmin adaptive coach training for a spring marathon. Easy pace at 9:30-10 minute/mile (5:53-6:11 km/minute) and LT around 7:10 minute/mile (4:26 minute/km) pace.

Fit and upper: I would say the Valkyrie Elite’s upper is really great right out of the box. Personally I found it most similar to the fit of the NB SC Elite V4 which was also pretty good for me. No issues length wise (fits TTS) despite the “anatomical toe box” being more built up and structured compared to your average supershoe. Width wise, I had minor foot spillage over the medial side all the way from my big toe to the end of my arch, but that’s since disappeared after just 20 miles. I was really excited about the laces, which were sawtooth laces (like the ones of the Vaporfly). Heel counter was somewhere in the middle between not stiff but also not flimsy with a good amount of padding. I had no issues with heel lockdown with a standard tie not using the last loop hole. Tongue was thin but I had no issues with lacebite.

Midsole: Stack height is 39.5 mm with a 6mm drop. TYR’s LaunchPX foam is 100% Pebax supercritical foam, which is what’s used in the Valkyrie Elite. There is a full length carbon plate sandwiched in between 2 layers of the LaunchPX foam. 
There’s some mild posterior and mediolateral heel flare which provided some stability similar to the SC Elite V4 or Endorphin Pro 4. The midfoot however is more narrow than either of the other 2. This is also still a supershoe so it’s inherently unstable.
I found the Valkyrie Elite to feel slightly more responsive than the Fuelcell foam of the SC Elite V4, but slightly less than Lightstrike pro foam found in the Adios Pro 3.
The rocker was on the more aggressive side, very similar to the Endorphin elite 1.
I found the midsole to provide a lot of rebound when forefoot striking and putting a lot of power in each strike (~8 Watts/kg). I would equate this feeling to a slightly mild version of what you’d experience in the Adios Pro 3.

Outsole: Ample rubber coverage of the forefoot and 2 strips near the heel. There is exposed foam in the midfoot. I ran on wet road directly after it rained but grip was superb and never felt slippage at any point. Not as good as Puma grip or Continental rubber, but it was good enough.

1hkwuan,RunningShoeGeeks,Asics S4+ Yogiri 25 mile first thoughts,"This shoe: Asics S4+ Yogiri, US Men's size 10. Cost was 20k JPY or about 135 USD.

About me: <30M, 5'11, 170lbs. Foot on border of D/2D width with a high volume top of the foot. Midfoot striker. 0-sport high school athlete

Other shoes and my sizing (US Mens): Boston 12 (9.5), Adios Pro 3 (9.5), EVO SL (9.5), SC Elite V3 (9.5), all normal width.

Paces/Runs: 9:30-10:00 easy paces, ~8:30 higher effort paces. Very recent half marathon time was <1:46 (8:05 pace). Cadence around 175 spm. Attached a ~7.4 mile strava run today with 2 easy laps and one faster lap and 350+ ft of elevation gain. I put in about 25-35 miles per week, with a few 3-7 milers and then a longer run on the weekends. Yowana out here inspiring me to up my MILEAGE

-- --

**Fit and upper** I was in Japan over Thanksgiving and grabbed both this shoe and the EVO SL. They didn't have my normal size in the S4+, but they had US 10M. I tried it on and it actually fit well, as this is a narrower shoe. I also wore 10M in the endorphin speed 2, and these fit somewhat similar to those although just a tad bit wider (I think the 9.5 B12 is actually longer than the 10 S4+). My toes feel like they have plenty of room. Upper is pretty comfortable - more daily trainer feel than race shoe - and is a cloth/knit feel than a plastic-y one like in the B12/AP3. No irritation anywhere.

They feel noticeably lighter than then B12s. I weighed them and it was 257g (B12) vs 248g (S4+).

**Ride and midsole:** The obvious comparison to make is with the Boston 12. The S4+ have the same idea as the B12s: A midsole stacked with race foam, a stiffening agent (in this case a carbon plate?), and daily foam on the bottom. However, one thing that is very different is that this shoe is STIFF. It's meant to be a racer after all. The B12s have a little bit of a bend to them by pushing the toe and the heel towards each other, but the S4+ has no give at all. 

As a result, the ride is simultaneously firm, yet cushioned. The FF Turbo+ foam is softer than lightstrike pro in the AP3/B12/EVO SL but not quite as bouncy or propulsive.  It makes up for this with the rocker of this shoe - it is more aggressive than the B12 yet incredibly smooth, which IMO is the key difference. At times I felt like the B12 was a bit sluggish because of its rocker. Most of my transitions in the S4+ feel like my foot is slapping the plate and then being pushed through by the geometry of the shoe. Yet, it doesn't feel as aggressive as something like the AP3. The S4+ feels like a firmer but smoother B12.

I can comfortably do easier miles in the S4+ without feeling the urge to go fast and at these easier efforts it doesn't feel like I'm fighting the shoe. I feel like for the same effort, I can run faster in the S4+ than the B12. However, I don't like taking this shoe to my threshold pace (7:30 min/mi). It can easily go that fast because it's light, but it just doesn't feel like the foam is responding - it feels too much like my foot is slapping on a plate. Maybe that's the feel that some want in their faster tempo shoes. I personally like something with a bit more bounce coming from the foam. 

Overall, these aren't a race shoe for me. Instead, they're a daily trainer that locks in a faster pace at easy efforts and can do fast, but not threshold-fast paces. 

**Outsole:** Lots of rubber coverage although I haven't been able to test it in wet weather conditions just yet. Feels sticky enough and I don't think these are Novablast levels of bad grip. 

**Other:** Build quality feels very solid and I'm guessing I will take these shoes to 400+ miles easily, unless I get bored of them before then. 

Laces are good - at first I was a bit concerned because they're thin but they have this jaggedy pattern that sort of locks them together when you tie them. Because of it being on the more narrow side, it could be a bit unstable for some.

1hkc1sp,RunningShoeGeeks,Adizero Evo Sl 100+ Mile Impressions ,"Adizero Evo SL 100mi+ Impressions

Context: 215lb @ 6’3 Midfoot Striker/Flat Footed
Ez Pace - 11:30-12:30 Interval/Tempo -8:00-9

The Good: This is probably the best foam I’ve ever used as far as versatility, its good for a 13 mi log run and intervals on the track. The shoe is not very supportive due to its minimalist upper however it is rather protective thanks to the strength of the foam. It lends itself to a light shoe rotation, I could see a very strong rotation just using the Evo SL and a race day shoe. I think 150 is a strong price point for its durability, I anticipate peak performance will top out around 5-600 miles.

The Bad: The Adizero Laces aren’t stretchy this time around but they are far from great. The continental grip rubber has no tread as opposed to the Boston 12 and SL2 which makes it less ideal in wet circumstances.

The Ugly: The midfoot cutout tends to collect dirt, gravel, and many other miscellaneous items. The tongue is not gusseted and the upper itself is still that synthetic scratchy material as opposed to the new soft uppers found in the adios pro 4 & adios 9.

What I want to see in the future:
There’s two main paths as I see it the Evo SL could either become the speedy daily trainer as compared to the SL2 and supernova rise, or it could become a more premium daily trainer, not necessarily leaning towards the speed, but just premium tech from the race shoes . In the future, I’d like to see a gusseted tongue with a softer upper and light traction as opposed to Continental rubber. You’re never going to make the Evo as light as the race shoes or as comfortable as the supernova rise but it stands strong as a testing ground for race day tech without the price point.

1hjz29o,RunningShoeGeeks,"Review and Thoughts - Adidas Pro Evo SL & Adidas Adios Pro 4 after 50km (31 miles) each! Comparisons with Other Super Shoes Included
","https://preview.redd.it/l9y2a1kspe8e1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bb49ba552cfd16a995ae115a92dab38cbd07d388

Currently sidelined from my marathon training for a week due to the common cold, so I thought I'd use up some of the free time away from running to write about these two shoes that I picked up in November and this month. I live in Asia, where Adidas has released these shoes, albeit in limited quantities and colourways.

Hopefully, this post helps to maybe make choices a bit easier.

Some background about me first: M, Late 20s, 161-162cm, typically hovers between 58 - 61 kg and my PRs are 1:35 half-marathon (hot climate) and 3:24 (cooler climate). Running for about close to 4 years. Typically high cadence of >190 & mid-foot/forefoot striker.

Shoe sizes I typically wear:

Adidas: US 9 (AP4, AP3), except for Prime X Strung (PXS) 1 & 2 US 8.5

Asics: US 9 (Novablast), except for SuperBlast (SB) 1 & 2 US 8.5

Hoka: US 9 (Cielo X1)

Nike: US 9 (Alphafly 3, Vaporfly 3)

New Balance: US 9 (SC Elite V4)

I'll start this post by talking about the shoes individually, and then combine them at the end with my overall thoughts for marathon training. I have more comments on the AP4 vs the Evo SL, but if you have any thoughts on either shoe, let me know?

**Adidas Evo SL**

**Fit:** TTS (US 9) for me. There's enough space overall and the fit isn't too snug nor too roomy. I think it's okay and decent. I don't have much to say because generally I'll know if a shoe is snug (my PXS1+2 is) but, this feels fine. No slippage or anything.

**Upper:** Same as the one in the EVO 1. Didn't touch the shoe but to me this felt just like standard smooth upper I've come to expect from Adidas. Only this time, no dreaded blistering (I faced this in the AP3, I'll write about it later). Breathable and nice. No further comments.

**Bottom Sole:** Continental Outsole for most parts with the standard Adidas rubber. Got nothing more to say - looked good after 30km (18.6 miles) and 20km (12.4 miles) each (I have 2 shoes). Doesn't seem to have any signifcant wear and tear.

(Added in after comment) Foam: Same LSP formulation as the Adios Pro 3, but bouncy.

**Workouts & Ride Impressions:** Did Runs ranging between 5 - 14km (3.1 - 8.7 miles) so far. All I can say is - wow, this shoe wants you to be quick! Slotting into the shoe, I realize it feels more ground-like as opposed to the shoes I've typically worn in (see above), but that didn't stop me from being quick or made it feel awkward at all! I am typically hitting tempo paces with these shoes easily, and it feels effortless.

I did try to do an easy run with this shoe - it felt great, but man, I had to hold it back to not make it a dash. I generally run by feel, but in this shoe, I always hit my Tempo and even above my MP paces towards the end! The foam is bouncy but yet firm. I had no issues with this shoe in wet weather, with the Continental outsole. You'll feel the ground feel yet the energy return is superb. Makes you want to go fast.

**Overall thoughts & comparisons:** Excellent for Tempo & Fast Workouts; easy runs can be done too! This is an excellent training companion overall!

I can see myself taking this shoe up to the half-marathon without any issues. This shoe can probably do easy runs, but my easy runs are currently being handled by the Superblast 2 and the Novablast 5, so I think I'll alternate this shoe and the Superblast 2 frequently. I do feel that this IS the Superblast 2 replacement for those who can't get it, despite the low significantto ground feel. I know many people take the SB1+2 for long runs, but I do my long runs in the PXS2 now.

Do you have to rush to Adidas to buy this shoe? I guess... not really? The SB1 & 2 works wonders but Adidas finally introduced something that's way comparable to the shoe and I'm no longer restricted to the SBs for these types of workouts anymore. But I would wholeheartedly buy more of these once my current pairs wear out. I really can't see any other shoe beside the SB fitting in the comparisons. Maybe the Novablast 4-5? But the Novablast is in its own category, I don't think there's any comparison.

**Adidas Adizero Pro 4**

I've written a more detailed review of this shoe as I was typing this out when I first got it after a few runs, but I waited for the EVO SL before deciding to combine it together.

Fit: True to Size. US 9, UK 8.5. They fit normally to me - I had no issue with the toe box space, it is just nice. Not too broad, not too narrow either.

Upper: Pro 3 users who suffered due to the upper, REJOICE! They've finally addressed this with an entirely brand new upper that is now a soft-like cloth(?) material. When I first touched it, I went ""OH WOW"". After my run - there was no blistering or sign that it was causing any friction on any part of my foot unlike the Pro 3! I felt so overjoyed with this upper, considering how the Pro 3 was my favorite marathon racer but I had to stop wearing it due to how afraid I am with the upper causing blisters.

I do believe some people will question its breathability, but I am currently training in a constantly hot & humid country, so this isn't a huge concern as my feet will adapt to it. Overall, the upper is amazing and fits very nicely and gently. Kind of like a sock-like texture. I had no issues with the laces or anything, they were good! The upper held up during my run, and there was no immediate sign of wear & tear despite it being cloth-like. The shoe and my feet were wet after the run, but this is more of a training location issue versus the shoe flaw. I think it's fine; breathability isn't an issue.

Bottom Sole: Continental rubber is now reduced to just a small portion of the shoe (where you're expected to strike at the forefoot), and the other part of the sole of the shoe is fitted with LIGHTRAXION. I had no issues with grip and easily navigated sharp turns with the shoe; this new sole material feels nice, grippy and good. Unfortunately, I have not (and will not want to, for now) tried this on wet surfaces, so I can't say much. But I think it'll hold just fine. Overall, no grip issues, feels like a Pro 3 grip.

Foam: This is not the Lightstrike Pro on the Pro 3. I can confirm. It is MUCH softer than the Pro 3, and even the Prime X Strung 2, which is my marathon trainer/cruiser.  (Edited) I can also confirm this is NOT the same foam as the EVO SL as the Pro 4 uses a different formulation of LSP whereas the Pro 4 has a new formulation.

During my trial runs, I found the foam to be more bouncy than the EVO SL & the Pro 3 and the energy return felt slightly more than the Pro 3, but not fully bouncy like the ZoomX + Air pods Combination of the Alphafly 3 or Hoka's Cielo X1. It does feel close to the ZoomX of the VF3. I would somehow categorize this as a taller VF3.

**The Runs: 2x Half-Marathon**

**First:** Medium-Long Half-Marathon 21.1km (13.1 miles) as part of a Pfitzinger Marathon Training Block - I was in the first week of the Taper Block. The first 2km (1.2 miles) felt so amazing, that I wasn't sure if it was the shoe or a new shoe placebo. I felt I was starting too fast, and I toned down slightly between 3-4km (1.8 - 2.5 miles) to control my Heart Rate (it was high, plus I was pretty nervous as these were my only pair and I was scared to damage the shoe). But after that, I kept a cool constant pace of an average of 4:55/km (7:55/mi) for the next 10km (6.2 miles) before speeding up from 16km (10 miles) to the very end at 4:42/km (7:34/mi). The overall pace for the half was 4:50/km (7:46/mi). I achieved a 1:42 half-marathon, but this was a medium-effort workout for me (due to my rather careless dash at the start), but in line with my efforts should I be racing.

**Second:** Another half-marathon, this time a ""race""  I took part 2 weeks after my full marathon that I achieved the 3:24 marathon time. Because this was a super crowded & congested race, I started out very conservatively at 5:00/km - 5:10/km (8:03/mi - 8:19/mi) before ramping up to sub 4:45/km (7:38/mi) for the final 10km (6.2 miles) and even a 4:03/km (6:31/mi) dash at the last km of the race. Energy returns felt amazing! The shoe was bouncy and energetic throughout, to the point where even my last km where I sprinted it still felt like the shoe wanted more!

**Overall Thoughts: I**t's an excellent shoe! The shoe rewards you if you are forefoot striking, but I am sure that heelstrikers won't be neglected either. I just didn't land on my heel too much to ascertain if heel striking would cause anything, so I apologize to the Redditors who are curious about heel striking - I can't give you many comments. The shoe has the 3 carbon rods similar to the Pro 3, so the geometry/curvature of the shoe didn't change much, which means you should expect the ride to be about the same.

I do believe slower paces will find this shoe good as well, but some may be concerned if the slightly softer LSP might be a detriment as compared to the firmer LSP found on the Adios Pro 3. The shoe is an awesome cruiser that keeps paces stable.

I feel like this is a great shoe from the 5k to the marathon for all paces. I also felt like Adidas polished this shoe very very well, especially the upper. I like this shoe and would want to reach for it more. If you love the Pro 3, you'll be happy to know that Adidas didn't change the shoe much, and this will be a good upgrade. However, I am very sure some may not like the softer LSP and prefer a firmer ride. If you're in that group, maybe go and snag as many Pro 3s on sale, but this is not my recommendation; it's just a preference for me. But overall, the ride and ""higher"" feeling of the Pro 3 still carries over to the Pro 4, and if you like that, this is a very good shoe.

**Comparisons**

Nike Alphafly 3: I think this is one of the shoes against the Pro 4. I love the Alphafly 3. The carbon plate is much more aggressive and curved as compared to the Adios Pro 4. I also find the ZoomX + Air Pods combination to give excellent energy return. I do my long runs in this shoe (>26km / >16.2 miles) and always find them to be an amazing cruiser that can sustain efforts, and oddly, I spend less effort on them versus any other shoe, even against the Pro 4. But the Pro 4 is equally amazing with the cruising ride, and I do suspect that the Pro 4 will work the calves less than the Alphafly. I like both shoes and both would work extremely well for the marathon. I've ran my marathon in the AP3 and did manage to PR, but after running my 2 runs with the Adios Pro 4, I'm tilting towards the Adios Pro 4 now. I'm going to get some more long runs to try and see which will be my next racer for my marathon. I really can't decide. I also note the horrible wear longetivity of the Alphafly 3  - whereas my AP4 did not have any issues with wear and tear after 2 half-marathons.

Nike Vaporfly 3: I think this is the closest Nike Shoe with ZoomX foam that the Adios Pro 4 is. In short? The AP4 is a taller feeling VF3. I like the higher stack, so I'll pick the AP4.

Hoka Cielo X1: This is currently my favourite racer up to the half-marathon distance, but will now be dethroned by the Adios Pro 4. I love aggressive front-shaped carbon plates, and the Cielo X1 provides that. However, I'm starting to not like how I feel about the slightly close-to-ground feel at the forefoot of the X1s, but this is nitpicking. I like higher-feeling shoes, and the Pro 4 is much higher. If you like to propel yourself forward, I think the Cielo X1 suits better. But if you want some control, maybe the Adios Pro 4 is better. I like both shoes, but if I had to pick one, it would be the Adios Pro 4, mainly due to weight & height. I won't find an issue picking either for a fast race day up to a half, but I'll try the Adios Pro 4 for now. Both are good shoes, either way.

New Balance SC Elite V4: This was my planned Marathon Racer before the Alphafly 3 came into my possession. The plate is less aggressive than the Alphafly 3, but between this and the Adios Pro 4, I think the rolling efforts are much easier on the Adios Pro 4. The SC Elite V4 is slightly heavier as well. Some days with the SC Elite V4 felt dull - I wanted something faster. I think the AP4 can go faster for sure. Overall, like the VF3, I'll pick the AP4 due to how much taller the stack it feels lets me roll faster.

Adidas Adios Pro 3: I did mention the AP3 a few times in my review, but GOODBYE Horrendous upper, but slightly softer LSP. Same Carbon rod system. AP3 has a firmer LDP. Softer LSP for the AP4. Aggressive? AP4 (by a bit). Cruiser? Both. Overall for me? AP4.

**Marathon Traning Summary**

So in short, my marathon rotations will be as follows:

Easy Runs: Adidas Adios Evo SL / Asics Superblast 2

Tempo Workouts: Adidas Adios Evo SL / Asics Superblast 2 / Adidas Prime X Strung 2 (Longer Tempos)

MP Workouts: Adidas Adizero Pro 4 / Adidas Prime X Strung 2 / Nike Alphafly 3

Race Day:

Half: Pro 4 hands down

Marathon: EITHER Pro 4 or Alphafly 3 (still deciding!!), need to do more runs!

The Prime X Strung 2 remain my favourite long-run shoe, and will continue to be a training supplemement

Overall, both shoes feel amazing and if you can pick them up, go ahead! But trust me - the running shoe market is saturated so much that there are always other brands that produce good shoes too. I just like these for my ride and feels. Your mileage may vary, so don't buy into the hype until you try!",2024-12-22 14:02:38+00:00,139,54
1hjmwhv,RunningShoeGeeks,Something new about the Adidas Adizero Adios Pro 3 - Possible?,"Ah, the Pro 3. It's been around a long time and there has been endless discussion about it and nothing new to say...

... or maybe not! Here are some thoughts and observations from least likely to most likely to be novel! 

1. The laces suck! Of course that's been covered. As has ""get some lace locks off of Amazon"". However, here's a minor twist. Personally, round laces are more likely to give me lace bite. You can get ""XPand"" *flat* stretchy laces and they might be more comfortable (they are to me).
2. The heel kills my Achilles! Unfortunately, many of us know that. Here are some tips that might help:

  a. Don't \*over-\*tighten your laces and consider using stretchy laces to minimize heel slip.

  b. Sometimes the top of the heel support on the outside is *pointy*. You can take some scissor and round the points down a little. (See the purple circles in the pics.) This helped a bit for me.

  c. Sometimes there is rough stitching in the top back inside of the heel. You could take out the stitching but things might fall apart. Another option is to take an Engo patch (blue low friction adhesive patch) and cut into an hourglass shape to sit in-between and around the two padding patches covering the rough stitching.

These 3 things solved the problem for me. Of course we shouldn't have to go to these extremes but we love that midsole so here we are.

3. If you get the bottoms of your AP3's wet enough, sometimes they will start squeaking with each step. I suspect it is the rod rubbing against the inside of the foam. When things dry out the squeak will go away. (Anyone else heard this? I've heard it rarely in my Boston 12s.)

4. Of course there have been countless colorways of these shoes. But did you realize there was also a minor redesign? On the medial side of the upper initially there was a small, pyramid-like version of the Adidas stripes. Later they moved to having 3 larger equal-length stripes that were just a bit smaller than the stripes on the lateral side. (See the picture.) Now, this may have been spurred only only by brand design, however my pet theory is that the larger stripes actually add *structure* to the upper as the stripes have noticeable thickness to them.

Feel free to add your own quirky observations and theories!

1hjhswe,RunningShoeGeeks,Nike Downshifter 12 after 400 miles,"A little about me - I bought these shoes as my first running shoes (like many others probably do) in April. I’ve slowly progressed my mileage to about 20-25 miles a week. Used to solely run in these but I bought a pair of Puma Deviate Nitro 2s for speed workouts in June. My 5k PR is 22 mins and 10k PR is 47 mins (in these shoes!) I’m also 5’10” and 180 lbs.

Seeing how people treat budget shoes in this sub made me want to push these to 500 miles, alas, I had to retire some daily shoes and I have a pair of Endorphin Shift 3s for when these give out so I decided to retire them from running a bit early. These shoes are so much better than people give them credit for, I’ve run up to 10 miles in these without any pain. The foam is softer then my Shift 3s, which not saying much as those are notoriously firm, however, for shoes that were less than $50 I’m really surprised at how comfortable they were. The grip is also so good!! I live in Portland and have never had problems running in the rain, even with the dead leaves on the ground that could cause some major slippage. The 2 negatives I really have for them is how narrow they were in the mid foot and how blocky they felt. I decided to lace through every other ringlet and it alleviates the problem for the narrowness for the most part. The rocker is almost nonexistent though and I found myself purposely slamming my heel so that I can roll through the toe with the little amount of rocker it had. 

This review comes from a beginner perspective, which fits because it’s who they’re made for! I’ve heard from posts on this sub that budget shoes can be almost dangerous and cause injury. However, if any beginners have found themselves with a shoe similar to this and are regretting their decision due to opinions on this sub, YouTube or elsewhere, don’t fret! Many reviewers are used to multiple hundred dollar shoes with top notch foams I think, therefore when comparing to a budget shoe it feels astronomically more lackluster. These opinions are still incredibly valuable! However there are many budget shoes out there that can do an amazing job and still feel comfortable. Would I recommend buying this shoe though? Probably not! I got this for just under $50 when I was a little less knowledgeable about searching for deals but you can find top notch shoes for $20-30 more sometimes that’ll be a much better value than this. In fact, I got my Deviate Nitro 2s from Ross for $40!

After I bought these shoes, I scoured for reviews to see whether they were a good shoe or not. I ended up regretting my purchase afterwards, however, after 400 miles, I’ve learned to love these shoes and I think I’ll miss them moving forward. I hope this helps some people that might be looking for more info on budget shoes :-)",2024-12-21 19:59:03+00:00,161,30
1hjf0nw,RunningShoeGeeks,Adidas Adios Pro 4: Quite Good,"Me:
6’2, 180 pounds. Half Mary PR: 1:29. Full Mary PR: 3:14

Background:
I am training for a marathon in March and have been considering which shoe to wear. For my last marathon, I used the Alphafly 1 and loved it. I assumed I’d use the Alphafly 3 for this marathon. But I tried it and personally don’t like it: too clunky and too wild for my stride. I wanted something a little sharper and controlled. I considered the Adios Pro 3, which I’ve used for a couple half marathons. But the upper starts to aggravate me after 15 miles or so. Enter the Adios Pro 4. 

Runs completed:
I’ve used the Adios Pro 4 for two runs. First, I used them for a 7-mile workout, with a 2-mile warmup, 3 miles at half-marathon pace, and a 2-mile cooldown. Second, I used them for a half-marathon. 

Fit:
Unlike others, the Pro 4 fits me true-to-size. It actually fits me perfectly—better than, say, the Adios Pro 3 and Endorphin Pro 3. I’m not sure why. I have Morton’s Toe, where my big toe is smaller than my second toe. So I always have plenty of room in front of my big toe, as you can see in the picture. My only guess is that maybe the cramped part of the shoe for other people is around the big toe, which wouldn’t be an issue for me.

Upper:
Incredibly soft and comfortable. I get a good lockdown without having to cinch the laces. The extra padding around the throat is much appreciated compared to the Pro 3’s sharp edges. I don’t have any concerns about wearing this for 26.2 miles. 

I wouldn’t say the upper feels warm—at least not in cold weather—but I am surprised to see the amount that I’ve sweat through the upper. 

Midsole:
I wanted something sharper and more controlled than the Alphafly 3, and I got it. The midsole feels lighter, softer, and bouncier than the Pro 2 and 3. I like the density of those earlier models, especially when I want dial it up during a race push up to 10K pace. But the Pro 4’s midsole feels more balanced—less bottom-heavy—and it’s more comfortable at all paces. It still feels nice during warmups and cooldowns. Even so, during my race, I didn’t have problem pushing the pace for the final 5 miles. It reminds me some of the Nike Next % (though I haven’t run in that shoe for while). It’s maybe not quite as inspiring as the Pro 2 and 3 at those top paces, but I’m splitting hairs. I won’t be dialing it up to that level during my marathon.

Overall:
I love this shoe. Just love it. For my foot and my stride, it’s right up there with the Alphafly 1. No question that I will use it for my marathon. ",2024-12-21 17:48:02+00:00,110,60

1hjc5xq,RunningShoeGeeks,Mizuno Wave Rebellion Flash 2 400km Review,"The less aggressive sibling of the crazy wave rebellion pro 2. I saw these on sale for £90, about 50% off. Given that I had decent success with the wave rebellion pro 1s, I figured the flash 2 should be a pretty decent choice. 

Fit: my feet are normal/narrow in width. The shoes fit true to size for me.

Upper: comfortable and stretchy. Tongue is thin and not gusseted. Laces are flat and work well. Pretty breathable. No real complaints about the upper.

Ride: these feel fantastic with a midfoot-early heel strike. Right where the apex of the bevel is. Ride is soft and bouncy when you land at the apex of that stack on foam. You get a nice sink in and smooth launch as you roll through the stride. The less aggressive geometry doesn't pitch you forward as much as the racing version. I found these good for daily miles and long runs. I think a heel striker might feel these may force them to adopt a more aggressive gait and go too fast. They can pick up the pace a bit, but I don't think they're best for that. They are pretty versatile, comparable with the best of what's out there with regards to premium daily trainers/super trainers. 

Stability: these are not stable shoes. I have fairly neutral mechanics and sometimes find myself almost rolling an ankle on uneven terrain. I avoid rocky trails because of this, also the cutout on the bottom is a rock magnet. You will feel it if roads have an aggressive camber.

Outsole: despite the instability, the outsole is fantastic. Ran through rainy weather on very wet roads, pavement and track without any issues.

Durability: fantastic. They will probably last a long time. Still going strong.

Summary: good versatile road cruiser if you are a midfoot striker with neutral mechanics. You can probably find these on sale for good prices. Mizuno has had pretty interesting releases lately and I'm quite excited to see what they put out in 2025.",2024-12-21 15:32:59+00:00,77,41

1hio5w0,RunningShoeGeeks,Review for Saucony Ride 17s (Comparisons to Ride 16s and also Wave Riders in general),"Longtime lurker. I feel like I have a fairly unique experience with running and dealing with injuries, so perhaps my reviews could come in handy for people dealing with persisting issues and also refusing to succumb to the hardships of being ""middle-aged.""

I'm about 190lbs. Mid-to-toe striker. 40yrs, male. Mile sub 6, half-marathon pace is about 7:30 or so. Never saw a point to run longer than that. I'm not a cadence runner but it's usually around 175-180 or so unless I'm on that final mile.

Readers digest version is that I had a calcaneal heel spur removed over two years ago (achilles was about to explode). Constantly overdid it during lockdown. Run. Stretch. Deal with pain for the rest of the day. Repeat. I'm over 600 days post-op. Still deal with tendonitis. Also dealing with an ankle sprain from a BMX accident in other ankle. Dorsiflection is almost back to normal. Go me.

I realize the purpose of running shoes isn't to mitigate pain, so this review isn't about that. I'm just a runner who deals with it, and running actually helps strengthen these injured areas. Meaning, the shoes I wear play an important role in wanting to enjoy my own personal version of pain therapy. However, because of my weight -- not trying to lose any -- and my injuries, I do not go more than 250 miles in a pair of running shoes. 

The weird jump from the 16 to the 17 is kind of perplexing. I'd say that the Rides, in general, are kind of stiff at first. A friend swore by them -- which is what initially prompted me to try them out -- and after about 50 or so miles I fell in love with the 16s. Best all-day trainers I've ever worn. Great for slow miles. And easy to run sub-7 min splits in a 5k or 10k race in them also. 

I was a Mizuno Wave Rider guy before trying the Rides. Those are fantastic right out of the box, but I usually start to feel impact of my runs at around 180-200 miles. With the Rides, your feet can really wrap around the terrain like a glove without having to deal with the impact. When I say terrain, I mean road or hard dirt, but I live in New Orleans, so running on pavement is a bit like... uhhhh... off-roading. With the Rides, I can easily take them to 250 miles (both 16 and 17). At that point, I make myself buy a new pair. I cannot take any more risks.

Now the the main point. The 17s are bulkier for no reason. I feel like Saucony changed a perfectly perfect thing, and it feels like they're already trying to marry a few of these styles together given the lack of selection from their current website. I'd never buy a pair of 17s again, and would in fact rather search for the 16s on Amazon or something. 

The upper is fine. I don't really care about the uppers that much in general, though, as the weight of shoes doesn't bother me a whole lot. My legs are strong. The soles are just starting to approach Hoka territory, and I hate that brand. Part of that is perhaps due to ankle-danger with these potholes here, but I do not think huge puffin soles equate to a softer, pain-free run. 

The 17s are like the 16s before they get broken in. But then, they never do. Maybe they're not meant for people my size, or rather, people my size who can still run at a decent speed. It's a shame, because the colorways are pretty dope for the 17s, as opposed to the horrid colors of most of the 15s and 16s. 

I ordered some Asics Novablast 5s and will probably review those next. As this is my first review here, I'll leave you with the post-surgery rankings of what I've worn once I could comfortably run 8-10 miles at a sub-8 pace:

Saucony Ride 16 - 10/10 The perfect all-day trainer

Saucony Speed 4 - 9/10 Great for race days but I barely got 150 miles out of them. I'd rather take a stab at their carbon plate option if the thing isn't going to last that long anyway

Mizuno Wave Rider 26 - 8.5/10 Really great all-day trainer. Not as much longevity as the Rides, and don't allow for as much ""oneness"" between the foot and the concrete

Saucony Ride 17s - 7.5/10 A great, long-lasting shoe that is a bit too bulky and stiff. 

If you like my review or have any advice for me (what you'd like to hear, etc) feel free to respond.",2024-12-20 16:56:44+00:00,18,17
1hillzv,RunningShoeGeeks,Yet another EVO SL review (from an adidas fanboy),"Also, had to share another Moose picture. 

Let me start off by saying I love adidas shoes. Mainly run the Boston 12,PXS1, AP3. I’ve never experienced fit issues like other people describe. I normally wear US size 9 but in the EVO SL and AP3 I wear a 9.5. I’ve heard the tongue was a thing people griped about , yeah, it could be a tad longer but really is a non issue for me. I just wish they kept the little cape (pull-tab) on the heel counter. 

I’ve been waiting to get my hands on these, so when they arrived I took them out for an easy 3miles (9:30-10:30/mile pace). Wasn’t really blown away at those paces but they were comfortable.

This morning I took them out for a workout (10X800m intervals  @ 7-6:45/mile) and was pleasantly surprised with the ride. Lightstrike pro is very bouncy, if you’ve ran in adidas you already know…not too firm and not too squishy. I really like the rocker on the EVO SL. It felt good for a wide range of paces. I can even see people wearing these as a casual sporty shoe. It’s very light compared to the Bostons that I usually use for speed sessions. 

All in all, a solid pick up for the price. Not a fan of these little drops adidas has done, but whateva. ",2024-12-20 14:59:59+00:00,322,71

1hhrfcb,RunningShoeGeeks,Adios Pro 4 - first run,"First run in the Pro4. Easy 6km run just to try them.

Fit: Im between US10 and US10.5. Usually both can fit me well but reading that they were on the short side I went for US10.5. Good choice. They are definitely short.
Otherwise fit is perfect. Actually crazy to go from very bad on the AP3 to this. The upper is brilliant, lockdown is very good. Laces are still far from optimal but with such an upper it works. 
Feel: they are much softer than the AP3. I read zoomx feel. That is not what comes to my mind. To me, it’s Cielo X1 soft and bouncy. Kind of crazy since the Cielo is one of my favorite shoes, the AP4 is just the perfect Cielo X1, light and bouncy. It’s quite stable too.
Outsole: i read that the new outsole is less grippy/more grippy. Today I ran on wet road. It was grippier than the AP3, 100%. I run everyday in the Evo SL since I got them and wet slick means trouble in the continental outsole. Maybe on dry the Continental is better. On wet, Id say the new outsole is better.

Only grip would be that the sizing is off again, and that I have a suction noise midfoot. Otherwise they are really really good. I can’t wait to put more kms in them.",2024-12-19 12:03:52+00:00,278,64

After months of debating to pull the trigger on these, I finally caved. Was able to get 40% off through a family member so it was a no brainer at that point.

I’ve been wanting to get a max cushion shoe that has an emphasis on recovery training. With that being said, after 20 miles, these shoes absolutely meet the mark. 

Now, after the first run (5 mile 9:45min recovery run)  I had some serious doubts. My first impression a mile in, I couldn’t tell if the shoe was super heavy or that it was just so cushioned that there wasn’t much responsiveness. Definitely had a “stink in”feeling. Mind you my legs were thrashed. So I chalked it up as a first run and had optimism going into the future runs. 

A few day ahead I broke them back out for a series of 3 runs almost reaching 20mile total with a long run of 8.5. And to be honest, they shined! 

The shoe started to get a slight break in which I think helped with the fit. The balls of my feet started imprinting into the sole and now I felt more responsiveness from the shoe. During my long run my legs felt unphased and wanted more mileage . Despite this shoe being the heaviest I own, on foot I could barely notice it after the first run.

I’ve wore this shoe to run errands and walk the dogs and it’s just so damn comfy and a serious looker.

This shoe is going to be an awesome zone 2 / Recovery Shoe for me. I can’t wait to see how durable the shoe. Definitely become a new favorite for me. ",2024-12-16 06:51:46+00:00,355,86

1hebb5s,RunningShoeGeeks,Zegama 2 Big Slow Man 100km update,"6'4 230lbs heel striker

HM 2:45 10k1:15

Been running outside in winter better -20C to +3C on snow, compacted snow, ice, and don't bare sidewalks. 

The Good: the shoes fits my foot really well no hot spots, rubbing, blisters. I have pointy heels and cash be sensitive to firm her heel counters (endorphin speed 3s shredded my heels) haven't had any issues. The heel counter is different than any shoe I've had before took a couple runs to get used to but I really like it now. The foam is firmer in the cold but still super comfortable, soft and bouncy. I really like the rocker rolls through really smoothly. The outsole does well in the compacted snow, fresh snow, and the odd sections of bare concrete I come across this time of year 

The bad: minor gripe but the laces are too short. They are regular sized but the shoe has the laces going down a good ways into the forefoot that they need to be longer. Water drainage ran in a warmer day where it was raining/sleet/frozen rain and the shoes got wet and did not feel like they drained much evenwhen the weather let up and took a good 24hrs by vent to dry out. Interested to see how they handle heat and if they get swampy. 

Overall: really enjoy the shoes they are super comfortable to bounce along in. Llook forward to putting a lot more kms on them",2024-12-14 20:10:02+00:00,40,13

1he6dyo,RunningShoeGeeks,First run in Adizero Pro 4,"Absolutely fantastic shoe! 5’11”, 180lbs. Age 45+. 
Took them out of the box for a 14 mile run. My time for the first 13.1 miles was 1:31:30. The shoe feels fantastic on foot. The new foam is bouncy but not too soft. My Boston 12 are much firmer so I typically only take them to a 10k. 

The rocker for the Pro 4 wants to keep me more on mid foot/forefoot than my Endorphin Pro 4, but it was not uncomfortable at all. I tend to strike my heel in the Endorphins. 

Zero issues with locking the shoes down. Tongue felt fine as well as the heel. Way better than Boston 12. 

I felt like the shoe was really wanting me to go faster. This was a first run so I did not push to race pace, but could have easily gone sub 90. At $250 I will probably save them for race day or if I really want to go tempo. Will wear my Superblast 2 for moderate tempo long runs. In conclusion I would certainly buy another pair of the Pro 4 when the time comes! ",2024-12-14 16:22:34+00:00,188,46

1hdstmp,RunningShoeGeeks,550mi+ Nike Pegasus 40 Shoe Review,"Long show review here!

To start, 5’8 140# runner, mid- to forefoot striker.

These took a while for me to break in. Stiff for the first 100 miles and causing some blisters for the first 50 miles. They felt great between miles 150-400 miles with the soles deadening out after 500 miles. I retired them at the 550+ mark after the soles feeling total dead (no energy return and really stiff). I could certainly get more miles out of them, but felt it was time to move on; certainly plenty of rubber on the soles with no rips or tears (apart from the heel cup tearing pictured).

These shoes remain a constant workhorse shoe. I got ~450 miles out of the Peg 39s and -700 miles out of the Peg 38s; so durability wise, this was somewhere in between. They felt more similar in ride to the 39s in terms of weight and energy return. Having run 20mi+ in the 41s, I can say the 41s feel great out of the box with no break in period and great energy return; would definitely recommend the 41s over the 40s but these are great option if you’re looking for a good deal!

Key Takeaways: 

Pros - very durable,good heel lock / fit and versatile usage (roads, light trails and a range of workouts)

Cons - a bit heavy, took a while to break in, almost a bit boring (reasonable energy return but nothing exciting)


I hope this helps people looking to explore the Nike Peg series and please let me know if any questions!",2024-12-14 02:25:11+00:00,94,43
1hdqgzt,RunningShoeGeeks,My thoughts on the Asics Superblast 2 after 65 miles (100km). ,"31M, 5'6, 140lbs, Size 9. 1:32 HM 

I've now run in this shoe for 65 miles. Just finished a 1:35 half marathon effort in them this morning. Already have the Hoka Mach 6 and Cielo X1 but wanted something else for long run efforts as the Mach felt a little flat after 10+ miles. I bought into the hype of the Asics Superblast 2, hoping it would be the answer, but I’ve been a little disappointed. 

The shoe felt stiff and slappy out of the box, reminiscent of the Alphafly sound (not as bad though). While they softened slightly after about 20 miles, they remain slappy and offer an abrupt transition that doesn’t encourage a smooth roll through the stride. I feel more comfortable landing midfoot, but the shoe seems to want adjustments to my natural stride (slight heel strike), making me very aware of it on my feet.

Lockdown has been the biggest challenge, especially on my right foot, where I get heel lift unless I use a runner’s knot. However, the knot causes soreness across the top of my ankle—something I haven’t experienced to this degree with other shoes with a runner's knot—and creates hot spots on the medial side of my feet during longer runs. Even then, I have had to stop and retie at some point every run to try and fix the fit without much improvement. 

On the positive side, the black colorway looks great (not that important), and the toebox width and upper are generally comfortable, aside from the lockdown issues. Wet grip is also pretty good with a long run in heavy rain and leaves on the pavement. I’ve tested them across various paces—from easier 10-minute miles to sub-6-minute tempos—and found they perform best at faster paces but feel underwhelming at slower ones, even 8 min paces. 

Compared to the Hoka Mach 6, with the early meta stage rocker, these just don’t deliver the same smooth ride and rebound for me. I’m considering selling them and switching to my Hoka Cielo X1 for longer runs (adore that shoe). Perhaps the Superblast 2 is better suited for heavier runners, as I might simply be too light to get the most out of them.

Anyone else feel this way or know how to address the lockdown issues? I'm just not feeling the ""shoe of the year"" that so many others are. ",2024-12-14 00:21:40+00:00,56,109

1hdfyz5,RunningShoeGeeks,New Balance Fresh Foam X 1080v13,"

First, thank you to u/movdqa for alerting us to the Black Friday deal at Joe’s New Balance. $83.45 including tax and shipping, minus $5 for using ApplePay (Amex Offer), minus 2% cash back at Rakuten (~$1.70) comes to a grand total of $76.75 all-in. Perfect for a cheapskate deal-hunter like myself.

I’m an Adidas super shoe fanboy. Though they’re still a bit snug in the toe box for me, they fit really well and have never given me issues with the upper or tongue as long as they’re adjusted properly before a run. They’re fast, nimble, and fun to push yourself hard in. That’s exactly what I *didn’t* want in a recovery/slow base miles shoe, as I know for a fact that I don’t have the attention span or self-control to be allowed to pace myself. The Boston 12 (also found on a deal last year 50% off at REI) has been the shoe of choice for base miles. They feel nowhere near as fast as my Takumi Sen 9 or Adios Pro 3, but after the first 50 miles or so they broke in to be just cushy enough to put in those 6-13 mile training runs without making me want to go for a PR. The problem with them is that they are still a “super shoe”. The energy rods and mild rocker feel juuuuuust fast enough to not let me settle into a slow, comfortable pace and the run ends up looking like an aggressive negative split pacing plan, starting the first mile at 10 minutes and somehow ending up above threshold at the finish. 

Enter 1080v13.

Runner profile: 6’5”, 230lbs, fore- to midfoot striker depending on the shoe and pace, mild pronation, high-ish arch, wide forefoot but normal midfoot and heel. Normally a size 13, bought a 13 here.

Putting these on and walking around the house, it feels like you’ve stepped into a pair of marshmallows. I don’t mean the tiny ones that go into hot cocoa, but the massive ones meant for catching on fire while trying to make s’mores. I could see these being an extremely comfortable pair for walking or standing all day, though they would be a bit overkill compared to alternatives. The laces are soft, the tongue is cushioned, and the upper has a soft, stretchy knit feel. These don’t seem to have the issue I’ve had with other knit upper shoes though, as some of the sock-like uppers stretch too much and feel like they don’t hold their shape. These 1080v13 hits the mark perfectly with enough stretch and soft materials to feel comfortable combined with enough structure that it doesn’t feel like the shoe moves around on your foot. No trouble with getting lock-down with the thick laces without cutting off circulation the first try. These shoes are also super roomy, which is a nice surprise after having shoved my foot into tight race-fit shoes for the past couple of years. If comfort is the name of the game, these are all stars. 

On this morning’s run I took off with my usual forefoot striking gait and the shoes felt… off. I expected the same pillowy softness as when I was walking but it surprisingly felt pretty average. It wasn’t until I started shifting my striking point back to mid-foot that I started to feel what this shoe is all about. The impact all but disappears when you mid-foot or heel strike, but you don’t feel like it’s absorbing or robbing you of energy as you roll forward to push off again. Energy doesn’t feel lost to oblivion like I’ve had with other basic running shoes, but it feels instead like the shoe returns exactly what effort you’ve put into it. An easy pace doesn’t eat away at your soul with each dull thud of a step. I was also surprised that the extra squish under foot didn’t feel wobbly. Though it’s not a stability shoe, it doesn’t feel like you’re going to roll your ankle in a turn due to having a generally wider profile.

Overall I’m more than happy with the purchase and can’t wait to put some slow, tedious miles on them in preparation for my next race in February. ",2024-12-13 16:26:28+00:00,92,23

1hd63b4,RunningShoeGeeks,Li-ning Yueying 4 Pro,"I'm very pleased with this shoe. Very cheap at below $60 usd when converted. Top midsole is soft, hs some squish but the energy return is very good, I think due to the bottom firmer layer. Bottom midsole layer is still soft just slightly firmer than the top. 5'6 61kg 15% body fat here - I also wear size 10us, so relative to my body I have bigger feet, ankles, legs so I don't usually bottom out my shoes, means it should compress more if you're heavier.

It picks up the pace very well, I would rather go with my carbon plated trainers for HM pace and faster intervals but when i tried these they were fine. They're very light. Very aiiry for long runs despite not much comfort/padding so I like the trade-off.

It has a nylon shank, not a full nylon plate. Maybe just to keep things stable and not flex too much due to the soft top midsole.

I was thinking of buying the adizero sl2 since it was on sale  ($93 in my country) but was contemplating because I also wanted shoe for long runs, for me I think I would be fine with it in long runs longer than 16km, I'm ok with lower to the ground shoes but loving the modern shoes getting higher as well. I still have the Floatride Energy 5 for anything below 16km so I thought this could be better than the sl2 in terms of cushion as it is higher and yes, it definitely is. The sl2 (only fitting) did feel nimble and streamlined which would fair better on faster workouts.

The rolling sensation in this one is like the Superblast, just softer and smoother, less aggressive maybe die to this feeling like a tad bit larger so the rocker starts late vs the superblast. I already gave away my Superblast to compare the width/base but I believe the forefoot is the same width, the midfoot to heel is definitely wider in the superblast but it's still wide enough in this one.

Outsole isn't very grippy but does the job, would be a bit cautious on wet surfaces unless on wet asphalt. Laces are too short so no runners loop in this one for me.

Very pleased for how I cheap I bought it. It's the sale price btw but it's full price is around $96, still cheap compared to other popular brands, I wouldn't compare these to lower tier stuff at the same price point as this doesn't feel like a low end shoe. Maybe the upper could be better but for the price I guess is expected and I love it's breathability anyway.",2024-12-13 06:14:38+00:00,57,36

1hcs5b2,RunningShoeGeeks,Adidas Adizero Evo SL - don't believe the hype. Feel it.,"To make it short. After the first run I have to say. Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Adidas, that's exactly the shoe I've always wanted. Why?  

I love the AP3, there is no shoe that I own more often and with which I have accumulated more kilometers overall. Long runs, tempo runs and interval units. For some runs, however, I wanted a shoe that wasn't quite as aggressive, one that would allow me to run longer, sometimes slowly. The Boston 12 was actually supposed to be the training partner for AP3.  

But unfortunately it only worked for me when I was well rested. And when is that in a training block? The SL2 is also okay, but it's limited over longer distances; I don't want to and can't enjoy running more than 12km with it. So the Saucony Tempus took over this gap for me. A great shoe, but again limited when you have to run at a faster pace over longer distances. That's why I always used old AP3s that already had a few kilometers on them for such units. It went well, but you don't always want to have carbon under your feet (at least not my calves).

There the Evo SL fits perfectly now, I can tell that after the first run.  The midsole is similar to the AP3, only more flexible because the rods are missing. The feeling on the run is more like a mixture of AP3 and Evo Pro, only without the extreme propulsion that the rods create. Slow paces the Evo SL is doing great. Also If you pick up the pace it starts bringt more and more reactive. 

This is a big difference to the SL2. With the SL2 you have to put in a lot of power to get energy back. I find the SL2 provides more cushioning (which is nice for certain runs), the Evo SL provides more energy. And the Evo SL is significantly more stable than the SL2. Also had no problems with sharp turns, downhill or other problems that many reviewers have described. But what I did because of these reviews - I tied the shoe from the bottom as tightly as possible without it constricting and tied a runner's knot. Worked great for me. 

I haven't been this excited about a shoe after my first run in a long time. Unfortunately, I've never run the Superblast (2), but when I read through all the descriptions, the feeling I have now with the Evo SL is the feeling I imagine the SB would have (if it's even better  , as many people say, I'll grab the next bargain [rofl].

1hbuwgv,RunningShoeGeeks,"Compliance measurements: Saucony Endorphin Elite 2, Elite 1 and Alphafly 3","
The total compliance measured is significantly higher on the Saucony Endorphin Elite 2 than both the Elite 1 and the Nike Alphafly 3.

Heel Total Compliance @ 900N
AF3: 0.022 mm/N
Elite 1: 0.022 mm/N
Elite 2: 0.027 mm/N (+23%)

Forefoot Total Compliance @ 900N
AF3: 0.017 mm/N
Elite 1: 0.017 mm/N
Elite 2: 0.020 mm/N (+17%)

While the Elite 1 and AF3 has same total compliance under the parameters of this test, the incremental compliance isn't the same across the force. This means they feel different at various point (ex: at the forefoot, the AF3 is softer at first up to ~60N than the Elite 1, and then it becomes stiffer). Also, above ~500N, all 3 have similar incremental compliance especially at the heel.

1hbsv7o,RunningShoeGeeks,Marathon in the Adidas adizero adios Pro Evo 1,"I ran a marathon in the Evo Pro 1 so you don't have to. But maybe you want to because it also carries normal runners to their best times? Let's find out.

A lot has been said about the Evo Pro 1, including by me, here: \[https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/s/XLrNDDO5B7\](https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/s/XLrNDDO5B7)

Here I had the opinion that the Evo Pro 1 can't really contribute much to the marathon if it takes more than 3 hours. Did that change after a real marathon? I'll say ""yes and no"". Because... First of all, about me. I'm >1.90m tall, weigh 75kg and my marathon PB before the marathon was 3:16.

*Processing img 6vhlmto7v76e1...*

Before the marathon I thought for a long time whether I should use the Evo Pro 1 or the definitely reliable adios Pro 3 (adidas just suits me). Oddly enough, it helped me to make a decision that I was able to try the adios Pro 4 at the Marathon Expo. It was a size smaller than I normally wear, but it was good for a first test. So – the AP4 is just so different to the AP3 and the Evo Pro, as it is incredibly soft under the foot. The midsole in the Evo Pro, on the other hand, is just as firm as that in the AP3. So, what the heck, i said to myself, if you have such an expensive shoe, you have to run in it. You had enough marathons in the AP3 and you want to try something new. (But that shouldn’t be too far away from your old racing-horse…) Before the marathon I thought for a long time whether I should use the Evo Pro 1 or the definitely reliable adios Pro 3 (adidas just suits me).

(But that shouldn’t be too far away from your old racing-horse…)

The good:

\\- The Evo Pro is incredibly light and the rocker ensures that it is easy to run a clean running style, at least at the beginning of the race (even for me - I am actually a heelstirker and tend to overpronate). It feels easier (may also be psychological) to log in and maintain the pace.

\\- Despite having run a few kilometers, the midsole remains the same as it was in the first few kilometers. Can't confirm the ""one race per shoe"" thing. I think I can use it for at least one more marathon and several shorter distances without any loss of quality.

\\-It hugs the foot and despite the very, very thin upper material, it is always tight on the foot, as it should be (although I recommend taking a size larger than usual in adizero models. Everything worked out fine for me, but a size larger would definitely have been more comfortable around the toes).

\\-it is very stable for such a light shoe (but not quite as stable as the AP3).

 The bad:

\\-The outsole is not Continental. Luckily I didn't have any problems with that during the race, not even at the refreshment stations where the street was very wet. But on the way to the marathon I went over several wet spots on the pavement and the shoe was very slippery.

\\-The price. Damn expensive. But we already know that.

*Processing img cxmtqxo7v76e1...*

 Conclusion:

I didn't regret wearing the Pro Evo. Unfortunately, I couldn't achieve a new PB (I actually ran 3:16 again), but that's probably due to the less than optimal preparation. I just didn't have enough strength for the last few kilometers, even though I actually ran really well and consistently up to km32. I imagine that I would have been a bit slower in the AP3, simply because it's heavier and the 32 kilometers ""at the beginning"" went very well thanks to the lightness of the Evo Pro. But that's not definitive, perhaps the more stability in the AP3 would have ensured that I would have been faster in the end.

 Would I buy the Evo Pro again?

It's hard to say. Firstly, I can get three AP3s for the money now (and I stocked up after testing the AP4) and secondly, I'll still HAVE TO try the AP4 when it comes out. (Don't) believe the hype to find out for yourself. The next marathon will probably be run in the AP4. And then I'll know better for myself.

1hbd3yk,RunningShoeGeeks,Brooks Glycerin Max - 70 Mile Review,"About me: 36 year old dad, 5’9” who weighs about 175lbs, 170-175 average cadence and am a mid-forefoot striker. I prefer trail ultras in the 50 to 100 mile range but occasionally send it at local 5k’s where I’ll run high 18’s to low 19’s and logged my best (of only 2) marathons at Bayshore in Michigan 2023 with a time of  3:13:xx. So while I prefer the longer, slower stuff I do run mildly respectable paces at races a few times a year.

TL;DR - Good for daily miles and long runs. The rocker is very efficient and the midsole balances stability and energy return well. Negatives are warmer/thicker upper, heavy, and cost but what you get and potential durability I think make cost less of a factor. This colorway also hides dirt and mud well.

Now onto the Glycerin Max. My use case for them is to eat up bigger mileage runs in effort to keep my legs fresh. Currently I’ve logged 9 runs in them, anywhere from a 4 miler up to 15 miler in them. This past weekend I logged 12 on Friday, 10 on Saturday and 10 on Sunday. Legs were a little tight Sunday but come Monday I felt fine.

Build Quality: I haven’t ran in many Brooks but these seem to be of quality. I really love how the eyelet chain holds the laces in place when tightening and the laces are of quality and the correct length. Nothing irritates me off more than a cheap pair of laces that are also too short…The upper likely would be warm but with winter setting in here in Michigan, I dig it. Outsole looks plenty thick and durable.

Fit: I went true to size (TTS) and it works. They lock down extremely easily just by using the top eyelet, no runners knot needed. I heard these had a voluminous fit which I’d argue but I wear a lot of Altra’s on the trail so obviously anything else will seem snug. They’re comfortable but I do have some pinky toe rubbing. I’ve considered using Brooks 90 day policy to return them for half size up. So I’m still on the fence. I think most will be happy with TTS. I haven’t had any issues with the tongue sliding around because it’s not gusseted, stays put in my experience.

Underfoot feel: I will say that for me, there was a break in period of about 30-35 miles. I prefer a firmer ride over softer, ex. think Endorphin Speed 4 vs 1080v13. I enjoy the ride of the ES4 and truly cannot stand how soft the 1080v13 was. Starting off, the Glycerin Max felt very firm. I was concerned that the softer formulated foam in the heel and firmer in the forefoot wouldn’t do anything for my mid-forefoot strike but after about 30 miles that all changed. It’s honestly hitting my sweet spot and I can clip off double digit runs seldom ever thinking about what’s on my feet.

Geometry / Rocker: Again, I was concerned soft heel and firmer forefoot would not benefit me. I couldn’t be more wrong. In fact, behind my all-time personal favorite the Endorphin Speed 2, the Glycerin Max might be my favorite shoe I’ve ever ran in. The rocker glides through my gait cycle efficiently, at all paces. I’ve done some short bursts down in the 5:30 min/mile range, ran progression runs starting at 8:30 dropping down to 7:00 and cruise typically around 8:30. They feel great at all paces for me.

Durability: As mentioned, the build quality is solid from the top down so far. I think these should last quite a while. I’m showing no wear at 70 miles but then again I never destroy an outsole/midsole. The outsole rubber is pretty thick and does grip well in most conditions. I’ve ran in the rain, in the snow, on ice, in slush, and on muddy backroads. They obviously struggle in mud, slush, and ice but were both plenty stable for me and grippy (within reason). 

The only real cons I can think of are its weight, upper being on the warmer/thicker side and cost. I think at $200 and someone who’s tried and didn’t like the superblast 1, these are a good buy if you're exploring the max cushion category.

Feel free to hit me up with any questions you may have. I’ll also plan to do a long term review here in a couple of months when they’re nearing retirement.

1hbbug5,RunningShoeGeeks,Adios pro 4 first run,"178cm, 78kg. Midfoot striker who tends to drop back more towards heel when tired. I underpronate as far as I am aware, I often land on the outside of my foot and roll off from the outside of the forefoot. 
Got these in europe ~2 weeks ago and did my first run, however forgot to write up my thoughts. 

Fit: fits very true to size, I have quite square shaped toes and my third toe left a blood stain on the upper (had destroyed it before so this aggravated it again). Never had an issue with the pro 3 upper so it just felt fine, as long as it doesnt hurt me I do not care at all about uppers to be honest. Maybe a small nitpick, but the upper stained my white socks, which is annoying but not the end of the world.

Ride: First of all, these are soft! Way softer than other super shoes I have tried recently, which worried me at first. In pic 2 you can see how easily you can sqeeuze together the midsole at the back, there was no way you could do this with the adios pro 3. I know some people found it easy to sqeeuze together the heel of the adizero sl2, I just tested it and in that shoe it has way more give than in the pro 4. 
For my first run I did 11k at 4:30/km as a nice way to get a feel for the shoe at a (for me) tempo pace. They felt much different from the mechanical feeling of the alphafly 3, which is probably to be expected. The reason I bring up the af3 is because that was my contender of being my favorite race shoe (compared to the ap3, ep4, pxs1&2, vf3, ts9&10), however now that I tried these my mind might change. When running I do not notice the extreme softness as much, however I did get a lot of bounce from it. Where I found the ap3 did not have that magic race shoe feeling, the ap4 creates that with this different feeling lightstrike pro. The alphafly does it with the airpods and I personally need this sort of “edge” in my supershoes to get me excited.

I must note that after this run I got sore in lower leg muscles I never even felt before. Because of the soft foam and my imperfect stride, these are just a tad bit unstable and I really didnt enjoy downhills and uneven sidewalks. Also, because I do not roll onto my toes, but rather stay on the outside of my foot, the cutout at the lateral side of the forefoot felt unnatural at times. I normally dont have issues with unstable shoes (like the pxs1), but I noticed it more here.

Outsole: i havent tried them in the wet, on dry surfaces it was just great, but yeah not a great way to really test of course. Normally I would notice at least some minor signs of wear at 11k, but these do not show any single sign of scuffing / marks on the outsole. All of the small nubs are still there. For my stride this really isnt always the case: my alphafly 3 is already showing visual damage at 20k (but idc its a race shoe). Can’t give out any expectations about the durability of the midsole, but I think it will be less resistant than the ap3. Also, I think more people will come across issues with broken rods and stuff on this version than the ap3. The foam is way softer, protecting the rods less.

I tried mentioning everything that came up after wearing these for the first time, if you have any questions or want me to make comparisons: I will be very happy to respond to them.",2024-12-10 20:47:16+00:00,227,57

1halzui,RunningShoeGeeks,First Run Impressions: Skechers GoRun Razor 5,"https://preview.redd.it/homa0lj3zv5e1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f291b1f6b6ce33f308f7971e2ca9caa94960b039

**Context:** 39M; weightlifter/cyclist who has gradually fallen in love with running over the past 2.5 years; 190 lbs; fore/midfoot striker; HM around 2 hours but working on it! Currently in a training block for my first marathon. Can bang out a 5K in about 24 minutes. Cadence around 175.

**Intro:**

Like everybody else on planet Earth, I was once skeptical about Skechers putting out a ""serious"" running shoe. That changed BIG TIME when I picked up the Alpha Tempo (formerly Speed Beast) earlier this year. I was (and am) obsessed with those things. I've raced in them, done countless speed workouts in them, etc., and there is virtually *zero* wear on the outsole.

But what I love most about the Alpha Tempo is how *fun* they feel. And the key to that fun is the Hyperburst Pro midsole, which is probably my favorite midsole to date.  It's tremendously poppy and snappy while still being very easy on the ol' joints. It's cushioned enough for long base miles, but it really sings when you let it rip.

Anyway, the Alpha Tempo is also kind of a *lot*. It's got a 40mm stack, it's got a very exaggerated rocker, and it's a little heavier than other ""race day"" shoes.

So when I saw Skechers was bringing the Razor back, I knew I needed to get these bad boys in my rotation. They're everything I love about the Alpha Tempo, but just a little *less*. In a good way. I just took them out for a tempo run during a downpour (because I'm an idiot) and wanted to share my initial thoughts.

**Size/Fit:**

These are narrow. I think the width of these shoes will be their make-it-or-break-it element for most people. The toe box, in particular, is tight. I have medium- to medium-narrow feet and they feel PERFECT for me, but if I had wider feet I think I would hate these things. I anticipated this a bit when I ordered, so I went a size up (I'm normally a US 10.5, but got these in 11). When I tried them on they did feel slightly too long, but it turns out they were actually perfect. But I will say that even a half-size larger than normal they are *snug* in the toe box. I can splay my toes, but not much.

Again, it's a preference thing. I am absolutely CRAZY about my Mizuno Neo Vistas (the best shoes I've ever run in), and those are tight as hell against my foot. But I like that feeling of security and ""connection,"" and these Razors deliver that. Just don't buy them if you have wide feet.

These also, being Skechers, come with the removable ArchFit insole. ArchFit is actually part of what made me love Skechers in the first place—I'm a medium- to high-arch runner, and that little nubbin of support under my arch makes me feel nice and secure. My first few runs in my beloved Neo Vistas had me feeling some dull arch pain until I replaced the insoles with arch support. If you don't like ArchFit, you can always swap 'em out. But just something else to keep in mind.

**Upper:**

Literally no notes. It's perfect. Secure, light, laces lock down just right, etc. I would love a loop on the back, but I feel that way about any shoe that doesn't have one. 

**Midsole:**

Within about five seconds of pressing START on my Garmin, I had just the biggest dumb smile on my face. Keep in mind, it was also pouring rain and it's the middle of winter in New England. Anyone watching me 100% assumed I was some kind of deranged maniac. And maybe I am? But anyway, I had a smile on my face because that magic TPU Hyperburst Pro foam felt every bit as glorious on the Razor 5 as it did on the Alpha Tempo. That same poppy, snappy, *I-know-today-is-supposed-to-be-zone-2-but-you-only-live-once-so-let's-just-step-on-the-gas-and-let-Garmin-Coach-yell-at-us-later* feeling. I really can't explain it better than that, so I just urge you to try a pair of shoes with Hyperburst Pro and see for yourself. See how many hyphens you'll start using when you try to describe it to people. See what kind of deranged maniac *you* become!

Anyway, the midsole is a complete delight. There is a lot less material here—31mm/27mm—and the rocker geometry is a little less ... *intense* than the Alpha Tempo. There is still an H-plate in the front, and I'm now realizing my shoe rotation is three plated shoes as I'm typing this. Whatever, what matters is the plate in this one isn't the Spring Heeled Jack super shoe variety, it's the kind that adds a little pop. I don't know if I really feel it, per se (I definitely do in the Alpha Tempo, and I *definitely* definitely feel it in the Neo Vista). What I do feel is a very lightweight, neutral, stable shoe that constantly nudges me to pick up the pace just a little bit. It just feels like a good time.

**Outsole:**

So this category I'm particularly well-equipped to talk about considering I just ran in the rain. The Goodyear rubber is *nuts*. It's like Velcro. It was so grippy it *scared me.*

And re: durability, considering I've been running (hard) in the Alpha Tempo for eight months and they genuinely look untarnished, I'm optimistic about how these will hold up. 

**Final Thoughts:**

If you want a pair of inexpensive, lightweight, durable shoes that will make you smile like a deranged lunatic on a rainy day, you should buy these shoes. Seriously, *please* buy them. Part of me is perpetually worried Skechers Performance will just go full pickleball. In fact, until these were announced out of literally NOWHERE a month or two ago, I thought Skechers Performance was done with running altogether. And I found this idea borderline heartbreaking, because I've loved every pair of Skechers I've had. I've also been running in the GoRun MaxRoad 6 all year (and they've also served as my walking shoes). This company puts out amazing stuff and it costs less than other manufacturers. Listen: these Razor 5s don't even have ""the S"" on them, if that's something that bothers you. They just say ""SKX."" They also make me look like I'm shooting rainbows out of my feet like repulsor rays. I picked these up for EIGHTY DOLLARS using a Black Friday code and some Skechers Points. But having run in them today, and knowing what I know about the other Skechers I've owned, I would absolutely also pay full price for them.

**Total distance ran:**

200km during various runs in cold weather. 

**My profile:**

* Male 
* \~82kg (181lbs) morning weight @ 13% body fat 
* 178cm (5’10)
* Avg pace/Recovery pace: 5:30/km (8:52/mile) 
* Avg weekly mileage: 50-60km currently (31-37 miles)
* Forefoot striker (midfoot when form breaks down) 
* Socks used while running: Balega Ultraglide 

**Overview:**

Five weeks ago I left a [review of the Novablast 3 and Novablast 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/comments/1gkb899/asics_novablast_3_novablast_4_initial_thoughts/) after two runs in each pair. While writing that review, I was very disappointed with my purchase of the Novablast 4 (NB4) and considered throwing them in the bin. However, some comments convinced me to keep them since they were supposed to soften up and improve after a while. So I kept them and used them for my easy days and easy treadmill running at the gym before my workouts. 

I’m glad that I kept them because something started to happen around the 100km mark. On almost all the previous runs before that, I always felt some slight pain somewhere, and worst of all was that my shin splints came back from the dead. But now all of a sudden they felt great. The midsole used to feel flat, lifeless, firm, and dead. But the midsole now felt soft, responsive, and fast. The seemingly random pains did not reappear either.

I have to admit that I was wrong about the shoes and that I shouldn’t have made up my mind so fast. I now realize that it takes a little while to get used to a new pair of shoes, especially since they are different from what I’m usually running in. I also realize that not all shoes are great out of the box and that some shoes need some miles in them to soften up. One of my biggest mistakes however was that I read too many reviews (not primarily on Reddit) that hyped up the shoes way too much. I also watched too many biased YouTube reviews. All of the combined reviews simply made me set unrealistic expectations on the shoes to begin with before I had even tried them on, and there was no way they could live up to all that hype unless I got a pair of Metaspeed Sky disguised as NB4’s. 

So, how do I think they compare to the Novablast 3 now that I’ve run 200+ kilometers in both? I believe the NB3s are faster, more responsive, and offer better energy return. My running form seems to suit the NB3s better, which might be why I prefer them for faster runs. But the Novablast 4 is great in other ways, and I can see why so many like them. Overall, both shoes are very comfortable, lightweight, and versatile. I will continue to use the Novablast 4 for my easy runs and treadmill sessions. In the end, it turned out to be a good purchase.

**Worth buying?:**

Yes. But I would suggest that you try them on in the store first and maybe jog around a little if possible.",2024-12-09 19:05:30+00:00,55,54
1haet39,RunningShoeGeeks,"Yeah, the Evo SL's are Pretty Great....","https://preview.redd.it/71vc015gxu5e1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6413ff593d201c548c42cb8f45da05fb6ea23b42

I was lucky enough to be on Reddit during the 35 seconds that Running Warehouse went live with these, and went the forgiveness-than-permission route with the impulse buy. I've put in only 23 miles so far, but of differing goals/paces: 4mi Easy, 8mi Easy w/ 5x100m Strides, 6mi w/ 4x1mi Tempo, 5mi Easy

tl;dr: I couldn't be happier with them, they do it all. They have fully kicked the Boston 12's out of my daily shoe rotation.

I know that there are a ton of reviews out there on these already, so I'll only highlight the things that stand out:

**Looks**: I can't not mention this. They're so good looking, imo. And remember, white shoes are faster, its (pseudo-) science.

**Fit**: True to size. I'm a US men's 12 in everything, still works great for me.

**Materials**: This is the big thing I wanted to mention. The upper is quite thin and mesh. I am all the time recommending mesh uppers to my patients over reinforced materials and leathers because they decrease rubbing, so that part is great for these, but do be aware that the upper is very, very thin on the Evo SL's. Most of my runs are at 5:30am in Colorado, and I have definitely noticed that my toes are slightly noticeably cooler than with other shoes. Not too cold, but colder. Its not something that would sway me away from the Evo SL's at all, but something to keep in mind.

**Midsole**: The full-slab of Lightstrike Pro is so great for easy runs - feeling very much so like the AP3s w/ just slightly less rigidity - but that's not where it shines. While there are no carbon fiber rods in these like the AP3s, the ability to pick up the pace effortlessly comes from the forefoot rocker starting a little more proximal on the shoe (about 60% instead of the standard 70%, per Adidas), so the ease of ability for the tibia to have forward lean allows you to increase turnover effortlessly

**Overall:** This shoe does an amazing job in my opinion of marrying 1) a lower cost shoe that 2) has premier materials with 3) the ability to be great for easy runs and hard efforts.

I'm a 6'0"" (182cm) 185lb (84kg) male. Currently, my rotation looks like this: Easy & Recovery Runs -- Evo SL. Tempo Runs -- Nike Zoom Fly 6. Intervals -- Takumi Sen 8. Race Day -- AP3 or AF3.

10/10, would buy again.

1hadsz5,RunningShoeGeeks,Adidas SL 2 and Boston 12: a superb trainer combo,"# Introduction

After having tried the Saucony line-up, I was left wanting more/different. The Takumi Sen 8's I was and am using as race shoes made a good impression on me so I decided to give Adidas a go. At first I was in need of a longer run shoe, thus I bought the B12. With its higher stack and dual layer foam it had enough 'structure' and longevity to get me through my long runs. I only took them up to 23km and they held up nicely. When my other daily trainer gave out I picked up the SL 2's as an everyday shoe, but I quickly found myself liking them for workouts as well.

# Some stats

17M, 73kg, easy pace: 4:55 - 5:30/km, recent pr: 10K 35:33

Total mileage up until now

* SL 2: 562km
* B12: 558km

# Ride and feel:

I found the SL 2's to be softer and squishier than the B12's while those were more 'structured', firm and bouncy. However, that made the B12's a better option for long runs. The B12's propelled me more and I often found myself running quicker at an easy effort than in the SL 2's. But, I could really sink in the latter and forget about them, which I really appreciated.

# Upper and lockdown:

This segment is quite simple to explain: the SL 2's were comfortable while the B12's weren't. The SL 2's have a padded heel with a plush, but not too thick, tongue. The lacing system works and doesn't require much effort. With the B12's I have to fully loosen them to just get my feet in them and then the lacing down part hasn't even started. Either my feet's circulation is cut off or they're about to fall off. The plastic upper does get more flexible but it's not for me. The only upside is that they're very breathable.

It isn't enough to ditch the B12's but it's for sure my least favorite part about the shoe. Both shoes are quite thin in the midfoot (I think they learned that from the Sen 8's because those are just hellish).

# Midsole

Both were enjoyable in their own way. B12's are a little more responsive, structured and bouncy while the SL 2's are softer and squishier. That said, I still used the SL 2's for almost every workout and they worked great (mostly because I couldn't be arsed to pack 2 pairs or running shoes every week to university). I even did some heavier 8x1k and 2x20min workouts.

# Outsole

Adidas rubber is one of the best in the business. I never slipped once and both pairs of shoes gripped virtually every surface. Both shoes have 0 wear and tear on the bottom.

# Durability

The midsoles are pretty compressed and dead-ish. The uppers and outsoles are still perfect though. All in all, they're just not performing as when they were at 150km and that's to be expected. The last run I did with the B12 was actually very shitty. Other reasons played a big part but the shoes definitely didn't help.

# Final thoughts

They're starting to show their age, definitely towards the end of runs. I'm not sure if I'll buy them again for the time being because there are so many models I haven't tried yet and even though I was very content with this combination of trainers, I want to try other options. Maybe I'll stock up on another pair of SL 2's and pick up a more comfortable long run shoe.

If you have questions, feel free to ask them because I'm sure I forgot to write a lot of important stuff.",2024-12-09 16:35:37+00:00,33,23
1ha8jvc,RunningShoeGeeks,Mizuno Neo Zen 60km First Impressions ,"I was so excited by these shoes as a lover of the Neo Vista. The running store I moonlight in got them a couple of weeks ago before their official release this Friday so I had to buy a pair and see how they stack up. 

Background: 30yo male, 65kg, midfoot striker. Usually race over ultra distance but I have a 5k best of 17:31 and a 10k best of 35:56. 

Look: I think they look great, more like a normal shaped runner than the Neo Vista. I would have loved the mystery colourway but I think that will be reserved for the big retailers only. They weighed in at 238g for me (US9). 

Upper: fits my foot pretty as good as any shoe has. No hot spots or blisters. Has some more structure to it than the Vista so it's not a death trap going around corners which is great. More airy than the Vista too which seemed to be a common complaint about it. Fit is true to size for me. 

Midsole: I've taken these shoes as quick as 3:50/km and down to an easy 5:30/km pace and have enjoyed the shoe at both ends. It feels light on the foot and the rocker, whilst not as aggressive as the Vista, makes transition from midfoot to toe off really smooth. I plan to use the shoe as a daily trainer which for me would be anything between 4:30/km and 5:15/km pace and I expect it to do that job with ease and enjoyment.

Outsole: the grip is good. Not on Puma Grip level but plenty adequate. Seeing as it has an almost identical outsole to the Vista, which looks in good nick after 450km or so, I don't expect durability to be an issue for the Zen's.",2024-12-09 12:25:18+00:00,181,119
1ha78ww,RunningShoeGeeks,First run impressions: Adidas Evo SL vs Superblast 2,"https://preview.redd.it/gsoifwjy0t5e1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a333bc9585475147d08a69cb028b2e06eecc2782

Managed to buy both shoes on a recent trip to Japan - cheaper there for sure than rest of world. Below are my thoughts after 2 initial runs each on the shoes, about 10km for each run (i.e. 40km in total in both shoes) on paved shoes in warm, humid weather (28 °C/ 83°F).

**Important context on runner**

* Very average runner - 3h50m marathon PB (in humid, hot weather), 1h47m HM
* Light 57kg/125lbs, 173cm/5’8”
* Typical shoe size (for all Asics, Nikes, NB running shoes) - US8.5
* Shoe pref / previous trainers - Mizuno Neo Vista, Superblast 1, NB SC trainer v1, Prime X Strung 2, Puma Deviate Nitro 2

**Size & Fit**

* **EVO SL**
   * Had to size down 1/2 size on Evo SL - unusual for me given that I’m a consistent US8.5 for most brands and models (including PXS2). Tried my usual size and it was way too large, very surprised. I know most reviewers have said TTS so it does seem quite odd to me.
   * Toe box definitely more narrow than Neo Vista and Superblast 1 (and 2). Can feel my small toe against the side of shoe but I wouldn’t go TTS. Has not caused me problems
   * Tongue has been criticised by many reviewers - it’s definitely finicky, but once in the right place, hasn’t annoyed me 
   * Ankle collar very snug/plush - didn’t require runner’s knot. But a lot of foam around the collar so not sure it’s the best in hot weather running
* **Superblast 2**
   * TTS, feels identical to the SB1. I don’t think I would be able to tell the difference if I had a fresh SB1 on one foot, and SB2 on the other
   * The upper of SB1 never bothered me so the upper on SB2 seems less plastic/scratchy but neither a pro nor a con to me

**Ride**

* **Evo SL**
   * Fun albeit less stable especially taking tight corners
   * The overwhelming sensation is that it is very light, what almost what I wished the PXS2 to be
   * I know the marketing material says this is a plateless shoe, but it has a small plastic piece in the midfoot, and I feel like I can almost feel it - doesn’t cause any annoyance or problems 
   * Very easy to pick up the pace in this shoe - more so than the SB2
   * But I feel that its less easy to sustain faster paces than plated trainers like the Puma DN2 so I wouldn't use this for speed intervals
   * But for 10k to marathon paces, Evo SL feels nimble and light. Very enjoyable ride
   * For slower paces, works just as well (although the lightness of it edges you to run faster)
   * For longer runs (>2hrs), I think SB2 may feel better just because it feels more padded
   * I could be imagining things but it feels like the foam has softened over the 2 runs, making it even better. Will report back
* **Superblast 2**
   * If you love SB1, you will love SB2
   * Great for long runs and easy to steady paces
   * Similar to Evo SL, you can use this for faster speedwork but wouldn’t be my top choice
   * I remember SB1 being a bit firmer on initial runs but SB2 seems great out of box

**Conclusion**

* I have seen many shoeTubers claim the Evo SL is different from SB2, I’m not sure I agree
* Yes Evo SL feels distinctively different from SB2 - more fun, light but less cushy for longer distance - BUT I think for most runners, there will be a very large overlap on the types of run you use both shoes for
* Which is better then?
   * If you have a long run shoe already that you love and only use for LSD (maybe SkywardX, etc), or you don’t run longer than 2 hours, and are looking to replace your daily trainer, then I will pick the Evo SL
   * If you want a do-it-all shoe, AND your long runs are quite long (> 2hrs)  then SB2
   * Though if you can find them in stock, I still recommend getting both. Both are great shoes.",2024-12-09 11:00:36+00:00,148,70

I’ve been nursing various injuries for the past month. Ran my first 2 marathons this past year and after back to back blocks , my legs have been beat. All my shoes from the year conveniently were all beat so I had a chance to grab a few new pairs. I ran ES4 , Rebel v4 , Hoka Mach 6 and Brooks Hyperion Max 2 max all year. I’m starting to get back in the swing of things getting ready to start a new marathon training block and wanted to make sure my new group of new shoes had great cushion without sacrificing responsiveness. 

I was able to get these shoes around Black Friday from Nordstrom for $65 (30%+33% F&F)and couldn’t pass for the price. 

Straight out of the box you can’t ignore the great looks of this shoe with the colorway. There’s something about looking good during the run that gives me the confidence throughout the week. (I know it’s cheesy). 

I took them out today on a EZ 7 mile run. The cushion in this shoe is plush and has a very minimal (sink in) feel but is also very responsive similar to the Hoka Mach 6. Outsole is tacky and felt great and stable during wet sections on my run. Upper is super snug as it forms completely to your top foot. Very similar to the brooks Hyperion max 2. I’m a 10.5-11 since that leans towards 10.5 and wish I would have got the size 11s. If you’re in between sizes, size up. 

All in a a great shoes intially, especially for the price. Can’t wait to see how the shoe breaks in and ready to chew up some miles with them. I would highly recommend for a daily if you can find em for 100-120$ online. 

Looking for feedback on how they break it and if any v13 lovers have any other recommendations for a tempo shoe based on my write up. I have the brooks glycerin max on the way for a recovery shoe and I’m in the market for a speed session shoe. ",2024-12-07 22:50:52+00:00,109,46

I recently purchased a pair for PUMA Velocity Nitro 2 GTXs this Black Friday as a winter daily trainer to possibly include in my rotation.

* User profile: M, 180cm, 70kg
* Shoe size: 28.5cm in all brands; EU44 in Puma
* Average weekly mileage: 40-50km
* Running style: neutral; fore and mid-foot striker
* Run used: 40 minutes recovery of pace \~6:00/km
* Terrain used: dry and wet road (concrete, asphalt, cobblestone) and muddy light trails

I was initially using [Asics Novablast 3s](https://runrepeat.com/asics-novablast-3) earlier this month but after days of rain and thin layers of ice on the roads, it proved to be dangerous for me. I replaced it with [Hoka Speedgoat 5](https://runrepeat.com/hoka-speedgoat-5) but wanted to try something lighter but still has a good grip on city surfaces. I never had any Puma running shoes before so I decided to try the VN2s to check out the famous Puma Grip for myself.

My first impression was the grip on the wet road: it was the grippiest of any Adidas, Asics or Hoka shoes I have ever worn and I was confident that I will be safe with it. The shoes were really light and my usual cadence of 170-180 were easy to do and not haltered by the trusted grip which was a pleasant surprised! I thought I would have to fight between those two but I didn't have any problems. 

I admit that my preference are responsive and bouncy shoes like the NB3s and I would put it a level below those but is not as flat and terrible as Asics Noosa Tri 15s and Adidas Adizero SLs which I both hated even after \~100kms of use. I've read that the VN2s will be much responsive after \~50miles/80km so I will definitely look out for that and prepare another review here. Regardless it was enjoyable and did what it had to do as a daily trainer (should I have bought the Deviate Nitros instead?).

I've read that the uppers tend to be slightly warm and since I used it on a winter day, I didn't experience any cold feet throughout the entire run and I was only wearing medium-thick socks. 

As for the length, it was also mentioned in RunRepeat that it runs long. I disagree because it was the perfect combination of snug and roomy as any 28.5cm shoes I had from other brands. Just beware that the Puma size chart is 0.5 less in their EU equivalents i.e. 28.5cm in major brands is US10.5 or EU44.5 but it is EU44 in Puma.

Unfortunately I had an small but irritating problem during the run: the laces weren't secure, they kept on untangling and I had to redo it twice until I resorted to the [runner's knot](https://www.instructables.com/The-Runners-Knot/). This is just minor and I can replace it with other laces but I didn't read anything about this quirk while reading reviews. 

In terms of the different routes I've ran on, it performed well and I actually felt the surfaces such as the muddy trails and roads filled with wet decaying leaves. I mentioned the latter because in comparison to the Vibram outsole of SG5 which is chunkier and I didn't feel the ground. This was just an observation and I have no preference unless I feel pain (mostly on flatter shoes) which there wasn't.

Overall the VN2s are a good pair of daily trainers for wet days especially with the Gore-Tex feature. It is affordable (in comparison to the other top trainers), weights light and great for daily training. I am impressed as a new Puma user! However I do not recommend it for runners with stability needs as it is flat and the insole is not supportive enough but you can remove it and put your custom ones.

Next steps: I will try it again on non-recovery days and possibly long runs to check if it will have more surprises after a certain break-in period. I am also keen on trying it on snowy days to check how the Puma Grip will fare on sleet and slightly icy roads.",2024-12-07 12:28:53+00:00,21,8

1h87up7,RunningShoeGeeks,Adidas Evo SL first run,"Someone in this sub posted a german website that had some pairs left. Got them for 119€ thanks to a discount. Were supposed to ship 2-3 weeks later but here we are 4 days later.

Size is my usual size US10 EU44. I have that in pretty much all brands and again they fit well. I have low volume wide forefoot and these shoes fit me very well. The tongue isn’t amazing I agree.

Took them for an easy run, 6km at 5min30/km pace and they are everything you can expect from a Lighstrike pro foam shoe with a big rocker. They feel like a relaxed AP3 with the roll on top of that. I love that. Im not a seasoned runner by any stretch, have been doing 20-25km a week for the last year or so, midfoot striker, 175 cadence whatever the pace it seems (or 172-178 from easy to 10km pace), 41min 10k, 1h30 HM. I really love the hobby of running thanks to the shoes and I probably bought 60 pairs in the last year so don’t hesitate to ask me for comparison. But my favorite shoes are the Cielo X1, Mach X2, 1080V13, Superblast 2. 
To compare the Evo Sl to some of the daily trainers I have such as the Balos (which I like), the 1080V13, the Rebel V4, the Mach6, the Evo Sl might suit me better since they roll very well with my cadence (some shoes make me feel I have to fight a bit even tho I love the softness).

Daily runner: SB 2
Speed workouts: Magic Speed 4
PB shoe (track): Metaspeed Edge Paris 
Recovery: Glycerin Max

Was looking for a shoe that didn’t have any standout issues.  All the shoes listed above serve their purposes very well but have at least one issue I wish was non-existent (ask and I’ll tell).  Side: I’m sure I’ll get more out of the MSE once I lose about 15lbs. 

Moving on to the review - the shoe fits TTS and I noticed the comfort of the upper as soon as I slid my foot in (supportive but not too tight or bulky).  The lacing system is very unproblematic and locks in securely without a runner knot (cannot say the same for any of the above shoes except for G Max).

First run was 2 miles, 6-7 min pace, 31 degrees, with 19 degree wind chill in cold weather running gear.  

Stability of the shoe was great and allowed me to follow through with my stride without issue, changes in stride length and turning with the road occurred seamlessly.  

Responsiveness of the shoe was just right, it didn’t push me but more so ran with me, and returned the energy that I gave, no part of the midsole lacked in this area.  Not too squishy or firm - it was equally balanced IMO.

I had no issues with grip and the upper was breathable but didn’t allow the windchill to freeze my toes.  

This shoe was super fun to run in and I can’t wait to take it out for longer runs in better conditions.  With that said, the return mile was an on road PB which says a lot considering my previous was in 70 degree weather in the MS4.",2024-12-05 23:25:47+00:00,234,71

Fit: Same as Boston 12 - In my case sloppy. I feel like I'm in between 11.5 and 12 men's in the Bostons - same here. Bought a size 12, probably should've size down. Will keep them and run thicker socks.

Laces: Trash - same as the Boston 12's. I'll replace them.

Ride: really nice. Despite moving in the shoe due to high volume feels like a less stiff Boston. Really great at hammering downhills (felt the same with Bostons.)

Looks: Black colorway looks kinda nuts and I like bold shoes. I'm calling it the ""freak on a leash"" colorway. It reminds me of burnout kids in high school wearing black and white tracksuits. The white colorway feels like it makes more sense.

\---

I've only run them 8 miles and will load them up with miles. For reference, I have a medium / normal volume foot. I trained for the Boston marathon last year and wore a pair of Boston 12's for every single interval and tempo workout. I run Alphafly 1 for road races - I found a discount pair and don't race enough to have a quiver. ",2024-12-05 16:55:02+00:00,41,63

It's a taupe/champagne color that they say is inspired by the sunrise and sunset.

Of note the Asics logo looks like a decal and not just printed on the fabric of the upper.  Not sure how I feel about that aesthetically and practically as it might add some weight (website says weight is the same).

1h6pf4h,RunningShoeGeeks,First impressions Metaspeed Sky Paris as a Heavy runner ,"Some background, 32(M) weighing 195lbs, 5’10.
Last race was a few months ago and was my first half at 1:31:xx

At the moment training for my first marathon in April.

Initially I wanted these when they first came out and there was loads of hype, but I said I’d hold off until I hit some business milestones. I didn’t like this colour but it just so happened that the were new in stock (and the other colours gone, and not being restocked in the ASICS store).

I tired on both the edge and sky and went 1/2 size up, which seemed right for me.

I tried both on the treadmill and the edge just seemed to close to the vaporfly 3 which I got at half price in September (and feel it’s a little soft).

I tired to run at marathon pace in the store but they started getting really uneasy, I imagine people typically plod along in their gel nimbus in the thing, so I didn’t get a true test.

I didn’t need these but I wanted to keep the promise to myself with regards to the business milestone.

Took them home and did a treadmill run yesterday and today (weather is brutal) and I’m a little underwhelmed.

I have the AF1, Puma fast R 1, Magic speed 4, VF3, Superblast and Deviate nitro 2.. and these felt way more unstable than any of those (Moreso talking about the racers).

It felt like I was almost wobbling side to side a little, which was a little annoying. I can’t say I really notice them being way lighter than others but they definitely are more firm and feel less bouncy than the AF1. It feels like more of a workout shoe, but maybe I’m just used to more foam.

The run was good, no issues with toes, heels or lockdown and I felt like they kept me going. I’ll hopefully try get them outside for a real test tomorrow just to see what they’re actually like in real scenarios.

I’m not at all confident these will be my marathon shoes, I couldn’t imagine at my weight they would be supportive enough in the latter stages. I’m still trying to workout the trade off between speed and comfort as I’m aiming for 3:05-3:15 but I’m still carrying to much mass to be a normal runner at that pace.

I’m also not sure that these will last in terms of durability with my size, but I knew that in advance.

I probably bought into the hype a bit much and these probably are reserved for lighter sub 3 runners. The chances are I’ll probably return these and get the Cielo x1 which I’ll probably enjoy more (and I also don’t need).",2024-12-04 19:54:34+00:00,158,52

1h6gxou,RunningShoeGeeks,Initial thoughst on metaspeed paris edge,"Being a 6'2 210lb runner, I dont consider myself a light runner  so cushioning to me usually is a priority. For instance I love running in the superblast 2 and hoka skyward X. With that said I have put about 10 miles into the paris edge and underfoot they feel amazing. 

They feel smooth on turnover at my quicker paces and let me really just enjoy the run and felt like an extension of the stride. Im predominatly a forefoot striker, most of my workout shoes barely ever get heel marks. 
The upper is light and flexible enough, but where I am dissapointed is that i feel like they run small, I wear a US  13 in almost every shoe, but the edge paris felt like they were atleast a half size smaller then the skyward X or superblast 2. Which led to some pretty not great bruising at the end of the runs. 

Phenomenal shoe, if it fits I cant reccomend it enough, I think for my own uses though ill be looking to part with them since the bruising is not worth it with other great options available.  I do wish asics made a bigger size in their top tier shoes. I think they stop at 13 in their race models.",2024-12-04 14:12:20+00:00,85,36
1h6ahyi,RunningShoeGeeks,First run review ASICS NOVABLAST 5 ,"About me, 26 year old male, typically Nike & Hoka runner, alternating between long distance trail runs & flat medium distance usually for recovery. 

Was looking for something a little more stable and comfortable to run all distances on easy terrain with & drawn to pre release reviews.

Tested on the treadmill for a fair while in store at ASICS (who were great) the day earlier while purchasing and immediately comfortable with the breathable but tight fitting upper/tongue of the shoe. The response from the midsole when landing and natural role forward to the toes became another relaxing feeling compared to other shoes where it’s felt more forced by my deliberate foot strike & take off patterns.

Location was tested on a double loop of a quick local gravel park run. Absolutely no issues re grip which has proven important to me with previous shoes (although it was a bone dry day).

With a previous broken fib, support is something that’s been an almost immediate tell all to me with different shoes, but this provided comfortable & noticeable distance between me and the ground without going full Mizuno Wave. 

Few quick strides in the run gave more green flags with response at pace felt off the forced easy roll onto my toes.

10km felt like enough time spent with these shoes to decide that they will be a very welcomed all distance shoe to me.

Did also notice a cut of foam scraped out of the inner midsole of the shoe, hopefully this isn’t a reoccurring thing as I run more often in these (guessing this happened as my shoes hit in running motion?). ",2024-12-04 07:20:07+00:00,109,24

1h5p7tb,RunningShoeGeeks,Superblast - a contrarian view,"My Superblast has an amazing midsole and a great upper in attractive packaging... which is where the benefits ended for me. It follows from the shoe's geometry and stiffness that it favours (and encourages!) the runner to overextend and let the momentum carry the roll over nicely.

In my Syoerblast whenever I picked up the pace and naturally landed midfoot and/or forefoot, I felt that I had to fight the stiff midsole with a flat midfoot and late toecurve geometry, meaning that I had to push myself forward to get to the end of the SB's large platform. The lack of toespring traction due to the partial outsole coverage just behind the toes (in front of the trampoline) and lack of midfoot rocker under a stiff midsole means that I had to exert extra effort before and during toe-off and still spin my wheels. In my case I had to adjust and allow the shoe to force me into lengthening my stride (and heelstrike) instead and let the momentum carry me forward, which was great for my muscles and my time... but less so for my joints.

In my view the Superblast works best and safest if you are what I would call a shuffling heelstriker anyways, which - if you were to watch a regular marathon - is around 90% of decent 3.5-4h recreational runners. SB is a less obvious choice for midfooters and/or athletic forefoot springloaders. I didn't get the hype at all and while I couldn't return them anymore, there were loads of pple looking to buy SBs even second hand. Mine went almost immediately on Vault after 50km in them with a €50 discount from RRP.

Yet I cannot say that I am entirely surprised by the shoe's popularity: it looks amazing, delivers on its long run promise by encouraging overextension, which results is less muscle fatigue and faster long run times. Happy days in the short term. The tradeoff (overextension) is carried by your joints, which is not immediately apparent.",2024-12-03 14:55:25+00:00,30,116
1h5oki6,RunningShoeGeeks,Novablast 5 First Run,"Sizing-I tried out TTS and half size down, these felt better at half size down.

Took the NB5 out for an inaugural 6 miler on a very cold morning. I’m impressed at how much of an improvement it is from the 4! The new FF Blast Max is an upgrade in terms of responsiveness and energy return in a very positive way. It might be slightly firmer than the Blast Eco in the NB4, and maybe compresses a little less but it responds quicker and with more gusto as you toe off. I would say there is less of the classic NB squish/bounce feeling, more of an instant response feeling from this new midsole. 

Stability wise, these feel like a cross between the NB3 and 4, slightly less stable than the 4, but better than the 3. The transition at the heel in the 5 is cleaned up and it rolls far better than the relatively blocky heel of the 4.

The upper is very comfortable, super breathable, my toes were getting cold from the wind which bodes well for warm weather. Outsole is much the same as last year. Very impressed for $140! Happy to answer questions.",2024-12-03 14:25:51+00:00,236,78

1h4bnys,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Skyward X - 100 km review so far. ,"1st Review. Go easy. 

About me: 34m 84kg. Mainly football (soccer) and gym. Got into running last Christmas and got the bug. Forefoot striker in the main / mid when tired. 21:20 5k is the only time I’ve run to time (Hungover). 

How I’ve used the shoe: Having sold all my previous shoes in a clear out (Bostons and ES3 and 1080v13) these have been used mainly for easy to tempo for the past 2 months or so. Paces of around 4:30 / km - 5:35 / km. Most are zone 2/3 managing my mileage around other sporting commitments. 

Upper: Comfy and hugging. Compared to the boston upper these are night and day. Easy to lockdown and I haven’t noticed a single hotspot or issue with rubbing. No issues with heat but that could be time of the year. Compared to other shoes I’ve worn. 

Midsole: It’s some stack alright. It’s been a really enjoyable experience having a shoe I know protects my legs and joints. Plenty squish but more than enough return at the paces I’ve used it. The plate definitely helps when I’ve turned up the pace in bursts. You can just sit and cruise along without thought as the rocker plus this midsole setup just seems to work. Wouldn’t be anything I’d reach for for fast speed work but when my legs are tired from lifting or football these are just prime. There’s absolutely no ground feel which was an odd feeling at first. 

Outsole: It doesn’t seem to be wearing down much at all so far. The grip is there, I’ve run on pavement , very light trail. Both in dry and wet with mushy leaves etc. I’ve not had any issues with slipping so that’s a plus. It’s not adidas level but it’s certainly more than enough. I wouldn’t be taking corners at any speed with the stack being this high due to my like for having working ankles, but I’ve no doubt it would be capable.

Overall I would recommend if you’re looking for a shoe that can chew up the miles and protect your legs. Hope this is useful. Thanks for looking. ",2024-12-01 19:46:20+00:00,114,43
1h49d49,RunningShoeGeeks,Karhu Fusion 4.0 Review,"I wanted to try a Karhu shoe because, as a Finnish brand, it isn't too common to see here in the United States. So, I gave it a go.

**Total distance ran:**

I have had these Karhu Fusion 4.0 for a while now, but have mostly used them for everyday wear. I have the bright blue color which looks really nice and matches some of my outfits. However, this week, I started to use the Fusions for running, and I haven't had any regrets. In total, I probably have about 50 miles of running so far in these shoes; so far, there are no signs of wear at all.

**Type of runs:**

These shoes have been very versatile for me. I initially tried them for a longer, easy run. Karhu's Fulcrum technology creates a rocker motion that uses all of the energy in your stride to propel you forward (instead of up too high or sideways).

The easier runs were a success, but could the Fusions help me at a faster pace? My easier runs are usually around 8 miles at 8:00-8:30/mi pace. I was feeling good, so I decided to push myself a little bit. I ended up running 8 miles at 7:25/mi pace, with a final mile of 6:30. I could feel the energy return helping my legs as I got more and more tired during the latter stages of my run.

And finally, what really sold me was when I went on a 5 kilometer tempo run in my Fusions. My goal was to go at a 6:20/mi pace, but I felt great and dropped a 6:00 first mile. I pushed myself to maintain this pace, and ended up running an 18:40 through the 5k - a new PR. My previous PR was 18:41, but in spikes and in a running uniform. This time, it was in pants and in my Karhu Fusion 4.0.

**Weather ran in:**

When I ran in these, the weather ranged from about 40 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit.

**My profile:**

Height: 5'10''

Weight: 140 lbs

I usually run at about 150 steps/min for easy runs, and 160 steps/min for faster runs. My cadence increased by about 5 steps/min for both of these when I was wearing the Fusions.

Strike Type: I am more of a forefoot striker, but the Fulcrum technology rocked me from the midfoot to the forefoot (but kept my ground contact time to a minimum).

I usually run about 40 mi/week.

**Positives:**

* Fits like a glove
* The bright blue color stands out
* Incredibly versatile
   * Surface-wise and run-type-wise
* Great energy return without a carbon plate
* Durable (so far)
* Rocker motion doesn't take away from forefoot strikers' form

**Negatives:**

* Not great for runners with stability issues
* Light for a Karhu shoe, but I think they could cut down that 10 oz to something lighter

**Overview:**

The Karhu Fusion 4.0 has proven to be a versatile and durable running shoe, providing excellent energy return for various types of runs. After about 50 miles of use, the shoes show no signs of wear, and their Fulcrum technology aids in a smooth stride by propelling the runner forward without excess vertical or sideways movement. The shoes performed well across different paces, from easy runs to tempo runs, helping me achieve a new personal best in a 5K. The shoes are lightweight for a Karhu model but could still benefit from being even lighter. While they offer great comfort and support for forefoot strikers, they may not be ideal for runners with stability issues. The bright blue color adds an attractive touch to the design.

**Worth buying?:**

I would definitely recommend buying the Karhu Fusion 4.0 - I believe it is one of Karhu's best shoes, and one of my new favorite trainers.",2024-12-01 18:09:11+00:00,14,10

1h47kj1,RunningShoeGeeks,Saucony triumph 22 117 mile review ,"Male, 5'11, 204lbs, atheletic build, midfoot strike. Size 10.5.

I must preface this review by letting you know I am primarily a trail runner. I bought these shoes to replace my glycerin 20s for easy, recovery runs on the road. 95% of my runs are on trail, so it takes me a long time to wear out a pair of road shoes.

Pros: these shoes are extremely comfortable right out of the box. My longest run in them is 13 miles, and they remained comfortable the entire run, even though I am 204 lbs. The midsole foam is showing zero signs of flattening. My glycerins felt way less peppy at this mileage.

The outsole is showing almost no wear. I was surprised. These shoes seem to be built like a tank. I feel like I'm going to be able to get well over 400 miles out of them. The upper still feels new. The toebox is nice and roomy. 

They're listed at a 10mm drop, but they feel more like an 8mm when I'm running. My glycerins caused some slight soreness in my shins and knees on longer runs, and these triumphs do not.

Now the cons: they run bigger than I expected. I have had several saucony trail shoe models over the years, and a pair of ride 16s in the past. Saucony has always fit me perfectly in a size 10.5. These fit closer to a 11-11.5. Both in length and volume. I suggest you try on a pair before you buy, or get them from REI, or somewhere with a generous return policy. 

The heel counter is a bit stiff, but it doesn't aggravate my achilles like most stiff heel cups do, I haven't had any issues with it yet.",2024-12-01 16:52:51+00:00,47,20

1h3tnkx,RunningShoeGeeks,ON Cloudboom Zone Initial Impressions ,"38 miles ran on these shoes so far

About me: Male, 5ft6, 140lbs, heel strike, flat feet, 170-185 cadence, averaging 40 miles per week

Types of runs: Easy/Recovery run (8-8:30/mile), 10 mile long run (7:40/mile), 5x1000 at 5k pace (5:53-6:06/mile) Track Workout, 400 meter repeats Track Workout (75s average split)

Upper: For how expensive this shoe is, I expected a lot better. The upper is comfortable but the laces aren’t long enough to do a runner’s knot and my heel isn’t fully locked. This wasn’t a big problem and didn’t affect my running but still an annoyance. True to size. 

Ride: At first I wasn’t impressed with the ride but I warmed up to it as I broke the shoe in and put on more miles. The ride doesn’t blow me away which isn’t ideal for a $210 shoe, but is still very solid and works very well for a variety of paces. The shoe is very lightweight and responsive. It truly shines on track workouts, as I was able to feel the bounce and response of Peba foam the most when I was running faster paces. At slower paces the shoe is comfortable and I enjoyed it for my easy runs, even if it’s not meant for them. I wish the rocker was more noticeable, as I generally prefer shoes with a strong rocker (for example Hoka Mach 6).

Conclusion: Great shoe, but the price is definitely ridiculously high, even for a full Peba shoe. For a much cheaper price you can buy the Hoka Mach 6, Brooks Hyperion 2, New Balance Rebel v4, or many other options that can fill the same purpose. You can think of this shoe as the listed trainers but with Peba. If you aren’t concerned with pricing then I think you will enjoy this shoe. I certainly enjoy it and look forward to putting more miles. I just wish it wasn’t $210.",2024-12-01 03:05:13+00:00,65,21
1h3nzn7,RunningShoeGeeks,Novablast 5 - First Run Review,"About Me: M28, 160 lbs, forefoot striker. I run 60 MPW, not training for anything currently. I mostly run on asphalt/concrete and live where it doesn’t rain too much. I do 1-2 workouts per week. My easy pace is 7:50 - 8:30 min/mile.

The Run:
	First run was 9.2 miles at 7:59 min/mile pace. I did about 350 ft of elevation for this run, with two sets of hill strides at the end.

Upper:
	This new upper is amazing. It is light but breathable, and maintains a good lockdown without being cumbersome.  I have a slightly wider than average foot (but do not need an extra wide). Overall, this fit TTS in my normal men’s size 8.5.

Midsole:
	I am surprised at how good this new foam is. A lot of larger review sites stated that his foam is “Softer,” and while that may be the case, I think that is misleading. While softer, it is not mushy soft, it is propulsive and cushioning. I usually tend to like firmer shoes, but this shoe was an exception in enjoying a foam that was not as firm. The best comparison I could make is fuel cell but with a higher stack, or, a very similar feel to the Adidas Adizero Sl2. The entire run I felt propelled forward, but also did not feel overly encouraged to run at a faster than normal pace, even though the shoe had no problem keeping up with faster paces. This is less stable than the 4th version, but not something that felt like I was going to roll an ankle. That being said, if you are a runner who needs some stability I would try this shoe on first, or stick with the NB4.

Outsole:
	It’s an ASICS outsole. If you are buying ASICS for winter grip/traction, you are buying the wrong shoe. That said, I had no issues with the grip, but I wouldn’t take this on a trail.

Comparisons:
	Novablast 4: I’ve put over 800 miles between two pairs of NB4 this year, and I can say this is a great improvement on that shoe. The upper is much less cumbersome and less padded (something I prefer), but still comfortable. The foam is much more propulsive, and I enjoyed it a lot more due to it having a larger fun factor. If you are on a budget I would still wholeheartedly recommend-heartedly recommend the NB4, but if you want the new version and budget isn’t an option, I’d recommend this 10/10 times.

	Superblast: I have ~ 400 miles in my SB1’s (Haven’t ran in the 2’s), and enjoyed this much more. This foam feels more propulsive at all paces, rather than just faster paces. Again if budget is an issue, I would recommend the NB5 over the Superblast as I don’t think you’re missing much.

	Rebel v4: I have loved the rebel v4 as a daily trainer and have just hit 300 miles in my pair. The NB5 feels like a Rebel with 40 mm of foam and a slightly more padded upper.

Overall:
	This is the best daily trainer/do it all shoe I’ve run in this year. I’d easily recommend this shoe to any neutral runner, beginner or advanced. The changes made from the NB4 are across the board great, and I am excited to run in multiple pairs of this through 2025.",2024-11-30 22:21:16+00:00,508,193
1h3nc18,RunningShoeGeeks,Asics Novablast 4 & Brooks Glycerin 21 >100 miles : A comparison,"Hello there! A while back I was asked by someone if I would compare the Novablast 4 and Glycerin 21. I’ve used both shoes a fair bit (118 mi on the NB4 and 145 mi on the G21) so I figured I’ve gone far and long enough in both shoes to provide feedback. Plus they’re both likely to be on sale or going on sale in the near future, so hopefully it’ll be useful to someone.

Quick info about fit/sizing/purpose: Wearing 9.5 women’s standard width in both. My feet are on the wider side of normal. Neither has caused any hotspots, irritation, or pain and fit great. Both shoes were purchased to be daily trainers, with the intent to get a new pair when it’s time to taper and wear one of them on race day. I use these two in rotation along with a Brooks Hyperion Max v1 I rarely break out.

About me: F, Early 30s, slow runner(11:00-12:15 easy pace despite trying to pretend otherwise). Currently training for my 2nd marathon in March, goal is 4h45.

Glycerin 21 pros: Super comfortable over long periods of wear. Great easy day shoe that protects the legs and can pick up the pace when needed. Have worn them for short sessions and had no problems or discomfort reaching cruising speed or going all out. They don’t really have a pace where they shine but rather can do a little bit of everything. I’ve gone 10+ miles in easy pace long runs in them and my feet and legs have felt fine afterwards. Outsole is phenomenal: looks damn near brand new forever, traction is decent without feeling sticky.

Glycerin 21 cons: Longevity - shoe looks great even at the end of its life (I’m on my second pair), but that’s at ~275 miles for me (weight: 175#). It’s like I’ve squished all the nitrogen out of it or something. Starts to feel a bit flat, then the knee pains begin about a week later. Long run sessions in this shoe are also a bit of a mixed bag. I was hoping for that protective feel to help me feel fresh on an aggressive progression long run and they missed the mark, which concerns me if I’m trying to keep things flowing on race day. Also, for what it’s worth, upper is a bit warm.

Novablast 4 pros: Light, snappy, bouncy shoe. Feels especially good uptempo but can handle a long slow cruise no problem. Have taken these on super slow long runs at 11:45 pace, and used them for pyramid workouts where my target pace for an interval was low 8’s.  Upper is divine - like a hug that’s decently breathable. Underfoot the rocker isn’t too aggressive but it’s there when you need it, which I appreciate. Outsole looks decent at current mileage - certainly leagues better than the 3rd iteration which looked far more shredded at 100 mi.

Novablast 4 cons: Traction - the world’s smallest puddle from your neighbor’s sprinkler will make you feel like you’re attempting to ice skate on the sidewalk. Less protective. In my case: when my calves are tight, these will not aid you in working through it. Feet are a bit more sore/tired after longer runs (not painful, just in the way that suggests I wear a recovery slide vs standing on my tile floor afterward).

Marathon Shoe Pick: Novablast 4 (tentatively)

I plan to wear the Novablast 4 for a half marathon race next weekend. If they perform the way I think they should do, the new pair I just picked up at the Asics outlet (despite the horrific colorway - creme with a hint of pistachio green and orange) will probably be the way I go. However, if the Glycerin 22 coming out in Feb is as worth the hype as it looks… 😏 Either way, both the Glycerin and Novablast can definitely go the distance, but I think that between these two specific iterations the Novablast will give me a little more help with keeping up the pace and reminding my running lizard brain that I’m wearing a bouncy speedy “race” shoe when mindset matters most.

1h3i24t,RunningShoeGeeks,<Review> Puma ForeverRun Nitro - 200 Mile Review,"**BLUF-->**

Picked these up on a good deal and logged 200 miles in the Puma ForeverRun Nitro over the past two months. It’s an underrated daily trainer, especially if your gait needs a bit of stability. With current deals (I believe you can find them for $50-$75), they offer great value. I expect these to last at least another 100 miles, likely more.

**REVIEW -->**

**Fit**: True to size (TTS). I wear an 11 in most brands, and it’s the same here. Despite swapping in Nathan’s lock laces, the lockdown remains solid. The upper is breathable, which is essential since I live in the southern U.S., where summers are hot and humid. Even on longer runs (\~10 miles), I’ve had no issues with overheating.

**Midsole**: The midsole has been a pleasant surprise—soft and comfortable. The \~9mm drop is noticeable, especially if you’re used to lower-drop shoes like Altras, but it works well with my mechanics as a mid-to-heel striker. The mild stability provides just enough guidance without being intrusive, making it ideal for those who need a little extra support.

**Outsole**: It’s Puma Grip, which means excellent traction. I’ve run in wet conditions with no issues, and the outsole durability has been impressive.

**How I Use It**

I’ve used this shoe for all my runs over the past two months: easy, moderate, threshold, and even intervals. It works well at soaking up slow to moderate pace miles but feels a bit clunky for fast intervals (400s and 800s). If your budget allows, investing in a tempo shoe for speedwork is a good idea. That said, this shoe shines as a workhorse daily trainer, which is exactly what it’s designed to be.

**Context**

I’m 5’11”, 165 lbs, and I run 25-35 miles per week with a cadence of 170-180 spm, depending on pace. As mentioned, I’m a mid-to-heel foot striker.

This is my first review post, so thanks for bearing with me. Let me know if you’ve any questions, happy to give more feedback!

1h23ssa,RunningShoeGeeks,Metaspeed Edge Paris First Run ,"Background: 18 year old male, 168cm and around 60kg. Running for around 2 years.

First of all, I want to say that I do not subscribe to asics way of describing the Sky and the Edge. I think you should try both on and see which one you think is better. For me, I ran in both on the treadmill at the store I bought them from. The Edge felt firmer and more responsive to me, which was perfect for my use case (5k/10k racing and maybe a road mile here and there).

I took them out for 5x1 mile today at around 3:40/km, and I felt like I was FLYING. After training in non carbon plated shoes for months, every rep felt effortless. The shoe felt a bit unstable walking around, but during warmup strides and the workout, it felt pretty stable, and very snappy. It might be the most fun shoe I've tried on since the Takumi Sen 9 and racing in Dragonflys. In fact, the shoe might be lighter than the Takumi. The upper is exactly what I want from a racing shoe, thin, lightweight, and snug. The outsole traction was very grippy, although I did nearpy slip a few times due to some ice on the track.

Overall it's an amazing shoe, but I will not be wearing them for another workout, and will save them for races instead. I want to put them on for a race and feel as smooth as I did today. Also, it doesn't seem like there's too much rubber coverage on the outsole so I don't want to chew it up logging a bunch of miles.

Side note: it is a narrow shoe, so if you have a wider foot, keep that in mind. I have a very narrow foot so the fit was just fine in my US size 8.

1h21vqo,RunningShoeGeeks,Adidas Takumi Sen 10 50 mile review. The Adios’ 8 bigger and faster brother,"About me: I am a 16M 6’1 145lb high school XC and Track athlete. I run 30 miles a week and my main races are: 3 mile- 16:14, 5k 16:49, 800- 2:02, 400- 52.2. I’m a heel striker as you see in photos 4-5

How I’ve used them: I’ve ran around 50 miles in these shoes, most of it’s been speed work. From 100s strides to mile repeats to 4 mile tempos. I’ve ran most of my mileage on a XC course where we train, so these shoes have been on mud, gravel, grass, tree roots, etc. I’ve raced in them only once, which was for a turkey trot today on roads.

The fit: As I expected with the TS 10s, they have a snug, race like fit, but I still have a thumbs width space in the front. Not much wiggle room, but that’s what I want in a speed shoe. However there was some heel slip but we’ll get to there later.

The ride: Initially the ride was a bit firm, but it softened up a bit as a broke it in. The shoe is very light and quite responsive. Think like a racing flat but more responsive. I could feel the rods propelling me forward, but what I appreciated more was the snappy turnover that made 5k paces easier. I love the nimble feeling underfoot and how it disappears, allowing you to focus on the race. 

Likes:
-Nimble underfoot feel, and decently responsive 
-Good grip, my footing felt secure and I had no problems with grip on a variety of terrains, except wet mud but no shoe really grips well on that
-Durable, it’s held up quite well and lightstrike pro only gets better with time. The outsole has smoothened out a bit in the heel, and the midsole has gotten chewed up a bit but it’s purely visual degradation. 

Dislikes:
-Laces(not the ones photod, the laces suck and they are too short to make a secure runners knot. Also they came untied constantly, even without  runners knot and I just took the sawtooth laces off my dragonfly spikes, and the problem has been solved
-Heel slip, it’s consistently been a problem in this shoe, and it’s gotten a bit better after some breaking in and it’s still a lingering problem 
-Lace bite, I suppose I should expect this with a racing shoe, but the lack of padding causes some discomfort and pain when I’m lacing up tight for a race

Comparison to the Adios 8: The adios 8 was what I used before and I’ve used it for countless workouts until I acquired the TS10 to replace it. The TS10 is a big step up over the Adios. It’s lighter, more responsive, gripper, and overall better than the Adios. However the adios is a bit more comfortable and reliable. If you are in the market for a racing flat and have the budget, then get the TS10. But the adios 8 is cheaper, and is constantly on sale. I purchased my adios 8s at 50% of for 65 USD. 

Conclusion: The TS10 is a wonderful speed shoe that will make 5ks and below slightly easier and more enjoyable. Replace those laces and you got an awesome tool to use for speed. Feel free to ask any questions and I’ll be happy to respond

1h1lpvb,RunningShoeGeeks,unfortunately for you it was me: a review of the Adidas Evo SL after 10 miles & much waiting,"# general notes on my likes & preferences as they apply to shoes

as my flair’d suggest, i’ve *really* been enjoying Adidas’ running shoes. the adios 3 was my second super-shoe and was my first moment of, “woah, shoes can do that?” and i’ve got \~300 mi between 2 pair. (my experience w/ the endorphin pro 3 was good, but not comparable.) the boston 12 was my first “super-trainer,” and i’ve put \~900 miles across 3 pairs. love the SL2 since buying it in June, at \~190 miles in em so far. i’m about to hit 100 in my pxsv1, but i only use those for long runs. me gusta adidas, as we say down in argentina. 

i find adidas shoes really fit my feet well — i have a quite wide foot at the metatarsals, but regular width at the arch & heel, basically shaped like a triangle. high volume foot. adidas’ lasts as of lately have been basically set up to reward that, with the combination of the rods in the AP3 & B12, and the use of LSP in the SL2. (it’s worth noting the one shoe this is not true of; the takumi sen series, at least the 8/9, did not fit my foot in either my ap3/b12/sl2/evosl/psx/adios size, a size 12. or even fit comfortably a half-size up. so imo, if you have a wide foot, most \*all\* of adidas’ line is available to you, but NOT the takumi sen series.)

i’m also crazy about lightstrike pro — it’s my favorite foam i’ve touched by a mile, second-fav is probably the flytefoam turbo present in the superblast. i’m heavy (200 lbs), and i find that LSP rewards high-power landings more than other foams i’ve tried (specifically recently that’d be the peba in Saucony’d Speed 3/Pro3 that i’m blanking on the name of for some reason.)

so the Evo SL was my most anticipated shoe of 2024/5 for me — exactly what i liked already, but without the rods that make the AP3 unfit as a daily trainer (if you believe it’s a good daily trainer, i love you, i see you, and you’re deluding yourself! hope this helps). but it’s just been impossible to get. many such cases!

luckily a fella also in NYC was selling theirs over at r/runningrack (go sub), and within the course of about 5 hours i managed to pick them up.

# visual impressions

i mean, they definitely look as good as you thought they did. maybe you thought “there’s no way it looks that good in real life?” but there is, and they do. if you didn’t love pics of the design then you probably won’t love it. but for me, there is a 5x mental joy modifier that gets applied to any run where i think the shoe looks \*really\* good, and that’s how i’ve felt in my runs w/ the shoe so far.

# comfort

… is excellent, and shoes adidas clearly learning from their mistakes with a speed that feels meaningful (cough nike cough). upper on the b12/ap3 sucked, but adidas’ technical mesh uppers on the SL and SL2 were nice, new ap4 upper is apparently great, and the upper on the Evo SL feels \*very familiar\* to that on the SL2 (unrelated — i feel like adidas’ naming scheme here w/ the SL series is a self-own long the line of xbox’s “series” debacle. this could have been easy!). laces are closer to the boston 12 than those in the SL2, but i haven’t experienced any meaningful lace bite, and my high-volume foot makes me susceptible to it. 

# first runs

i did 4 mi the first day i got them, with a mix of tempo paces (\~7:30 min/mi) and easy effort (\~9:30 min/mi), with a handful of stride accelerations at the end (\~6:45 min/mi). the tempo pace was accidental and psychological, that thing where you put on a new shoe and you wanna run fast just to see what it can do. and it’s interesting, the feeling of the shoe — there’s a \*hint\* of uncanny valley if you’ve run a lot in the AP3, because the feeling underfoot of a thick slab of LSP foam is so familiar, but with 2 major differences: 1, there are no rods to boost propulsion, and 2, the rocker is in a meaningfully different spot.

re: point 1, i found the shoe actually slightly \*less\* stable than the AP3 — i don’t really need stability in my shoes, i land on the lateral edge of my midfoot, but i noticed when turning corners & running on unstable ground. my running theory (nice) is that the rods take chat’s effectively a chaotic vector chart and aligns the vectors just north/south — propelling your foot forward off the ground, but not propelling it to the side. so in the absence of the carbon rods of the ap3, the shoe feels equally \*bouncy\* but less \*propulsive\*, as there’s far less “call” to lean forward & engage pace.

point 2, i’m not sure where i land on the moved rocker yet. what i liked about the 70% rocker on the ap3 was that if gave the shoe a “flat” feel. but the new 60% point rocker definitely has me up on my toes a little more — i find they pull me forward into a quicker running position than the SL2 do. but that’s what’s a bit odd here — without the rods present, the shoe is relatively \*less\* pace demanding than the Boston 12 or Adios Pro 3; yet the rocker position makes it, in another way, \*more\* aggressive than those 2. huh!

overall, though, the shoe is a wonderful ride — it’s meaningfully more pace-flexible than the AP3 or B12, but i think it loses in pace flexibility to the SL2. the SL2 can handle top-end speed just as well as the Evo SL, but the Evo SL lost to the SL2 at my slowest paces (\~9:30 easy miles). it handles thudding downhills with aplomb, but accelerates up inclines with ease due to how light they are. i mean it’s just nuts to experience it; it’s quite good.

today i did 7ish miles on them, and wore them out to get pizza afterwards (without staining them with sauce!). they’re excellent easy run shoes, but again, that 60% rocker definitely made me push into the 8:30s when i was aiming for 9:30s — i think my body learning how to utilize a rocker like that at different paces may take a bit more adjustment time than the meager 10 miles i’ve gotten so far. and it’s worth noting again: they look like a million bucks. there’s even the fun mindgames aspect of it w/ other runners where it’s like, wait, is that big guy wearing Adios Evo Pro 1s to jog 9:30 min miles? i mean i know no-one’s thinking about it like that; just a fun what-if.

# conclusion

i was right in that it was basically everything i’ve wanted in a daily trainer: a light, fast, sexy shoe that \*can\* go quick, but doesn’t \*make\* you, and one without any structural enhancements (plates/rods/etc). these are those! and while they’re not revolutionary, they \*absolutely\* feel like the market turning a corner w/r/t the quality of “basic” running shoes. i think a lot of running shoe manufacturers are slowing their EVA foam usage, but some (hoka! nike too) continue to use eva & supercritical eva in their lower-market shoe offerings. but with adidas offering this for $150? this is the thing in tech, too — the real advantage of incredible iphones isn’t incredible iphones — it’s that the median low-end phone will be *much* better. and i think the Evo SL is going to become the template of a specific kind of daily trainer that, hopefully, we’ll see more versions of from brands.

Half Marathon 2:45  10k 1:10 heel striker

Ran a 5k on the treadmill in them at a 6:40 km pace

Fit: fit my foot really well similiar to the Novablast 4. No hot spots pinching etc heel wasn't as padded as some other shoes but not really an issues didn't have any run or heel slip.

Ride: not the biggest rocker front to back felt similiar to the Brooks Glycerin 21s  aka a lot of foot in contact with the ground at once. I prefer a more heel to toe rocker. Foam also felt similiar to the Glycerin not hard/harsh but definitely not soft/bouncy (in fairness I've been running in the Zegama 2s lately which are the softest most bouncy shoes I've run in so might be selling the RADs a bit short). Would feel comfortable running up to an hour in then any longer and they would be to firm for me.

Overall verdict: bought them because I wear RAD Ones for working out/CrossFit and like the brand so I bought the runners. They are plenty comfortable to walk around in and that's what I'll use them for might occasionally run in them if it's all I have with me.",2024-11-26 23:35:10+00:00,21,6

* Forefoot Striker
* Supinator
* 40 year old male
* 5’10/155 lbs
* 50-75 Km a week
* Half - 1:31:06

Super trainers/ Carbon plated shoes I’ve used:
-Hoka Cielo X1 - 200km
-ASICS Superblast - over 1000km
-NB SC Trainer V1 - over 600km
-NB RC Elite v2 - over 600km
-Adidas Adizero adios pro v3 - 350km

I didn’t intend to buy these but was looking for a replacement for my Superblasts and because I live in a market where NOTHING is available (South Korea),  got these on a whim because they were on sale for 150,000 won (about $108 USD)

First Run: uptempoish 12.9 km/4:55 (8 mi/7:55)

Upper: Great upper. Feels substantial but not too heavy. Got my regular size 8.5 and fits well with no heel slippage issues. 

Midsole: Midsole is smooth. The first few KMs I actually wasn’t impressed but it got better as the run progressed. The midsole seems very smooth but not poppy or bouncy to me. The plate doesn’t really pop or propel but rather guides. I love the Cielo X1 but sometimes I really have to control my stride because of how bouncy it is. The Zoom Fly 6 just seems to glide in comparison.  I think some people could use these for easy runs, but I don’t think I can. The plate isn’t as stiff as others but I could still feel it at slower paces. Even though the stack is high, it didn’t feel wobbly and felt stable throughout. 

Verdict: I found my middle shoe for my rotation. While no where as versatile (or light) as the Superblast or as fun as the Cielo X1.  This shoe on the first run made the miles enjoyable at a faster pace. It doesn’t have the “wow” factor that some others might, but it is smooth and comfortable. ",2024-11-26 04:34:03+00:00,164,60
1gzvtmb,RunningShoeGeeks,First run and first half marathon in Saucony Triumph 21 ,"Me: I am Female, 5'1 , 79kg slow runner, 5k PB 38 minutes, 10k PB one hour 17 minutes.Runner since April . Uk size 4. European size 37 in trainers. 

Shoes: Saucony Triumph 21 , heel to toe drop 8mm or 10mm, high stack, rocker, , looots of cushioning ,neutral runners and perfect for heel strikers. Also feels very light. 



First run: I set out a 17km run ( around 10 miles i think) but I ended up running my first ever half marathon in 2 hours 45 minutes. I had no pains, no aches ( i used to be prone to shin splints and calf pain, hence i changed to high heel drop shoes). 

The sole is very springy yet firm. The rocker helps me push myself forward. I like a lot of cushion but I find most shoes like Novablast too soft and sinking. 
I do like a snug fit however if you dont, order up by size and half instead of one size. I am a UK 3 in sandals and 4 in trainers , a 4.5 would have given me more room at the toe box if you like it that way. 

The grip is good, did slip on some wet leaves running downhill couple times. So could be bit better. I ran on road, footpath, mud, pebbles and it feels stable. 


It was only my first run but I can say this might replace my current favourite Puma Magnify Nitro 2. ",2024-11-25 22:23:35+00:00,125,67

Context:

Been using a couple a speed shoes for the month and this is the first time I am actually amazed for a pair of shoes wich is not carbon platet. No blister issues, no heel slippage, just fun and fast runs. And I love that color.

Currently using Saucony Speed 4 and Adidas Boston 12 as my up tempo and speed training shoes.

Overall, I think I will reach to the Mach X2 for every speed session as of now to confirm they are my current best option.

Will sell the B12 as they are the less comfortable out of the 3 (confort > grip it seems)

Will keep the Speed 4 as my versatile option.

1gzlild,RunningShoeGeeks,Alphafly 3 first run from a very non-elite runner,"About me: 22M, 178cm & 79kg~, 42:30 10k (havent done other distances recently). Midfoot striker (from race pics)

Fit: I actually think they fit great in half a size smaller than I wear in my daily trainers / adizero shoes. I normally buy all of my shoes in a 9.5, as a 9 is usually too narrow at the forefoot for my foot type. However, I feel like the alphafly is quite forgiving at the toes and it feels quite roomy. Compared to my vaporfly in a 9.5, they have around the same amount of room (will attach pictures).

Got these for €150 so decided they might just be worth a shot, normally only run in adidas (ap3, pxs1&2, takumi sen 9&10, b12) and never tried anything from nike. The first thing I noticed is that in a 0.5 size bigger, they seem to be 20g heavier (see pics, the purple pair is 9.5, other one 9). Apart from the fact that the size 9 fit my foot well and didnt feel too small, it is why I went with the smaller size for my 10k and will probably reserve the bigger size for a longer distance event.

Used these for 2 runs so far, 6k break in session the day before my 10k and the 10k itself. I broke my PB by 2 minutes, which I ran with the prime X 2 before. Must say that I went deeper this time as my heart rate was noticeably higher. Both the prime x 2 and alphafly 3 feel best when extending your stride and that is exactly what I prefer in a race shoe. I have given the takumi sen 10 a chance, but they really just feel best with a forefoot strike on interval runs for me. The alphafly 3 felt amazing, by far the best race shoe I have tried so far, be prepared for some cool sound effects during your run though.

I also got a pair of the alphafly 2 (was able to get them for €110) as I want to save the magical feeling of the 3 for just races, as well as for the fact that they are not durable for someone like me. My stride is not perfect in any way and I tend to wear out shoes fast, so already see some signs of wear on my af3. The alphafly 2 feels much more mechanical than the af3 and I personally feel like it is a bit of a harsher ride compared to the 3. Though I do not see this as a bad thing, I would rather train in something like the 2 and be blown away by the 3 on race day. The fit of the 3 is wider and more forgiving, and has less of a prominent arch, did personally not have any issues with the arch on the 2 though. Both of the alphafly’s feel completely different from anything adizero to be honest; the fit, the ride, the traction. 

Overall, I really like the fit of the alphafly 3 and the smooth ride it has. It is not as mechanical as the 2 and it likes my running style where I open up my stride as I speed up. I assume this is because of the stack of soft & responsive cushioning allowing me to put down the increased amount of force with a longer stride.

If anyone wants me to compare it to anything, or has any more questions: let me know!",2024-11-25 15:32:39+00:00,155,38

1gz9spw,RunningShoeGeeks,ASICS GEL-Cumulus 26 first run,"I got my hands on the ASICS GEL-Cumulus 26, and since there aren't many reviews for this shoe here, I'll try to give an overview of my first impressions! 

A bit of background: I'm a beginner runner with an average daily pace of 6-6.30 min/km and around 40km+ weekly mileage. I'm 175 cm, 88kg, and a midfoot-heel striker with an average cadence of 175. I'm used to a more bouncy and responsive shoe with the Superblast and Puma ForeverRun Nitro.

I took this bad boy on an easy 10k at 6 min/km straight out of the box, and right away, I felt a major disconnect between my feet and the shoe. It felt like I was running on slime or something. It felt very mushy and I could feel that it didn't give a lot back. I know that not every shoe needs to feel responsive and quick, but I didn't feel like I was enjoying cruising with this shoe at slower paces either. I suspect it was the Ortholite sock liner, so I changed it with one from my old On shoe as soon as I got home. The mushiness is immediately gone and the shoe feels a lot firmer, but I still need to try it out on a run to see how it changes the ride.

Another issue is that this shoe is not very breathable. My feet got super hot during my runs, especially because I live in a warmer climate. The Fluidride outsole is okay, but I ran on wet surfaces, and I didn't feel very confident with the grip.

On a more positive note, I love the look of this shoe I thought it looked great in this colourway. I'll try to clock more easy miles with this shoe, and hopefully, it'll break in (or I will get used to it).",2024-11-25 03:41:00+00:00,80,70

Figured I would share my experience with the ride of both of these shoes and how similar the rocker geometry,l and roll through on foot strike both are.

No don't worry, I'm by no means saying the Glycerin Max is a contender for the slot the superblast fills in many runners rotation.  

But rather having logged just shy of 1,000 miles in two pairs of the superblast I have become very familiar with the ride of that shoe.  It dictates your foot strike slightly but in a good way.  Overtime you except it, hate it or enjoy it.  I have enjoyed the ride of the superblast since day one.

I did not think I would find another shoe that rolls so smooth through foot strike like the superblast does but in a softer format...and just feels ""more forgiving and better"" underfoot while still offering that smooth transition.  

I have logged 30 miles in the glycerin max so far.  It's a big shoe but somehow manages to disappear on foot.  I don't understand how but it does.  With that much stack you would think it would be a clumsy block of a shoe but it's not....it's actually rather nimble.  Yeah, nimble...not a word I would have ever thought to use for a gigantic max stack shoe.  I have never owned a single pair of Brooks running shoes in my 30+ years of running.  But I'm glad I waited.

In the pictures you can see that Brooks most definitely did their homework and straight up borrowed that rocker geometry and width from the superblast.  The ride in these two shoe are so similar it is baffling.  Yes the Brooks is heavier and softer underfoot but the way it rolls through is the same.  The late stage rocker is not only visually identical but also feels the same on toe off.  

I can actually keep a higher cadence of around 180 in the Brooks compared to 170 in the superblast.  That's not a huge difference but I am a high cadence runner and prefer to keep it higher on easier days with max stack underfoot so I don't lose that turnover.

I will continue to use the superblast as a long run shoe with faster sections but the glycerin max will be replacing the superblast for long runs with steady pacing....especially when the legs are tired.  

Why am I writing any of this...I have no clue just laying down my thoughts on both of these shoes and thinking maybe this little bit of info may help someone else.",2024-11-24 22:20:33+00:00,138,25
1gz16wb,RunningShoeGeeks,Zoom Fly 6 First Impressions,"Got the new Zoom Fly 6 and decided to take them on a 10 mile long run to see how they fell. Plan on taking them for a workout in a few days to see how they feel at faster speeds.

Running Ability and comparison
5'10"", 155lb, midfoot strike, US Men's Size 11
5k: 22:57, 10k: 47:30, HM: 1:43:22 

Upper: The upper is very no nonsense. It's not flashy or the greatest you'll probably find but it gets the job done very well and I never had any issues with hotspots. Laces were good and didn't have any lacebite.

Midsole: The upper ZoomX layer is very bouncy and compliments the Flyplate very well. They give a strong rolling sensation and less of a bounding feel. I did notice that the more forward you are on your footstrike, the more bounce you get from the ZoomX. The Flyplate isn't as flexible for me as other people have noted. The lower SR-02 layer has very nice soft and cushioned ride. One large complaint is the stability. Going downhill was very sketchy and I don't know if I'd do the same route again in the shoes because of it. And the general stability on flat surfaces was also a bit more than I'm used to.

Outsole: The waffle outsole was very tacky and I had 0 issues of slipping on the run.

Score 8.5/10

If it wasn't for the issue of stability, the shoe would be a 9/10 for me. Thankfully I've practiced and trained stability for a while so it isn't as much of an issue for me right now but could be very bad for some people. Another thing to note is the toe box width. I was very surprised on how wide the it was, included a Pegasus Plus as a comparison and it is noticeably wider.",2024-11-24 20:51:02+00:00,104,49

I have wide feet plus high volume insteps. True foot length is US8. For regular width shoes I HAVE to go 1.5 sizes up at US9.5 D just to not have a painful step-in feeling.

Even if the toebox feels ok, most shoes still feel very tight on the midfoot due to my insteps. Both my ES4 and Topo Specter 2 gave me foot numbness at US9.5 D, so unfortunately regular width shoes just don't work for me and I need 2E wide shoes.

https://imgur.com/a/yCTF8i8 - shoe pics at its current state

Not only is this my first running shoe ever, it also happens to be the very first running shoe I tried on when I started shopping for running shoes. I remember that initial step-in; it was absolutely perfect and so comfortable. 

I thought it was too good to be true initially; since its the first shoe I tried on, then maybe obviously anything would be better than nothing or maybe I just wanted to get the shopping experience over with. But nope--the salesperson gave me more shoes to try on and they were nowhere close to that amazing step-in feel I felt with the Brooks Glycerin 21. I was instantly sold. Even in the following weeks after I already got these shoes and tried other different shoes at stores, nothing lived up that same feeling.

**Upper/Fit** - Size I got is a US8.5, 2E wide. No heel slippage. Upper and fit feels very comfortable. It's not quite breathable in hot temps. But now that it's cold and constantly raining here in the Pacific Northwest, the upper is perfect for these conditions. Even if it's cold out and my shoes and socks are completely soaked from the rain, my feet don't feel cold.

**Outsole** - Amazing grip. Have taken these mostly on regular roads but also on the track; including conditions of pouring rain, loose gravel and dirt, and mossy surfaces. Even during threshold workouts in these conditions, I can run with zero hesitation and feel planted to the ground with no slippage. Despite the worn down outsoles from the picture, grip still feels same as brand new.

**Ride** - Feels very comfortable and cushioned. Protected from ground feel. Have tested this on all types of runs. Feels great and responsive up to tempo paces. Just disappears from foot. At threshold and above, while it can be done, it does leave me wanting a more propulsive/bouncier shoe especially since my thresholds are usually 19min reps. 

The weight of this shoe, compared to the lighter shoes I've tried, doesn't bother me until I hit the faster end of my tempo runs and into the threshold+ speeds where I do notice that I have a harder time opening up my stride in these speeds.

Shoe feels very stable and offers a smooth rolling ride and transitions as a heel striker. This is in comparison to my Rebel v4, where so far it doesn't feel as smooth when heel striking. 

Out of the shoes I have tried, including the NB Rebel v4 I recently bought, I definitely prefer the Glycerin as my daily trainer for normal/long/recovery runs. Maybe even prefer it in some tempo runs as the comfort and smooth ride kinda outweighs the speed benefit that I would get from lighter/bouncier shoes like Saucony ES4 or Rebel v4--which are still comfy at slower paces but noticeably less comfier than the Glycerin. Glycerin still feels responsive at tempo speeds for me.

----------------------------------------

Unfortunately, the shoes foam feel dead and flat now. It started to feel flat at around 450km; weirdly enough it was only my left shoe that felt flat but my right shoe was still good. Then finally in the last 50km I have run so far this week, my right shoe finally caught up and feels flat now too. It's to the point that I'm actually suffering persistent shin aches on my left leg after runs this week. I did run the last 300km of these shoes as my only shoe in rotation; I probably could've extended the lifespan of the foam a bit more if I had a rotation.

Overall, amazing shoe as a cushioned and comfortable daily trainer that just disappears on foot and offers a smooth relaxed ride.",2024-11-24 02:25:40+00:00,33,7

1gy4jby,RunningShoeGeeks,Zegama 2 Big Slow Man First Run(s) Impression,"6'4 230lbs

1/2 marathon 2:45
10k 30mins
Heel striker

Runs: did a treadmill session then this morning ran an hour outside in the snow in -12c (10F). Outside ran 7:40-8:15min/km. Treadmill ran 6:20-7:40min/km

Fit: true to size, fit similiar to my Nova blast 4. (Pumas/Hokas I need wides) Good width in the forefoot/toes not a ton of vertical space in the toes but the material is flexible and no issues for me. I have really pointy heels and stiff heel counters cause blisters didn't have any issues with the Zegamas.

The tongue is comfy and protective needed to tie the shoes pretty tight by the heel to get lockdown but didn't have any bite from the laces.

Ride: Haven't run in a zoomx shoe before and I get the hype now. Super comfy and bouncy even at my slower pace. In the cold they were a bit firmer than inside but still super comfy. 

Felt the tall stack for the first bit outside but after a couple kms they disappeared and were really comfortable. No rubs/hot spots. They handle the compacted show really well and cleared concrete very well. In soft snow they weren't very grippy/bitey but handled fine. 

Minor inconsequential gripe: shoe laces are too short

Overall: Really enjoy them and look forward to longer runs in them. Training for a spring trail marathon and unless something weird comes up i will be running it in the Zegama 2s.",2024-11-23 17:13:26+00:00,56,31
1gy2a1b,RunningShoeGeeks,"Xtep 160x 6.0 Pro, 3 runs","China shoe time :3

The shoe puts a lot of new things on the market featuring the first shot-molded foam and the first carbon plate that is reinforced with PI fibers.

Since I reviewed the 3.0 pro and 5.0 pro I will also get the 6.0 Pro! 
And here it is. For people who ask: there is no 4.0 version because 4 is bad luck number there 💀

To me, Iam 175cm, currently 70kg, midfoot striker (the first 30km 🫠) and my weekly running distances is currently about 50-70km, because... Its very very cold here right now.
Iam usually wearing US9, with 

In Chinese brands I usually have to size a half up.


Took them out for an interval session (3:20-3-40/km) a slow daily run (8km, 5:40-6:20/km) and a threshhold run 10 km (4:40-5:20/km)

Tldr:

Pro:

- insane rebound and resilience
- super fun ride
- super comfy upper and tongue
- cpu outsole and high build quality = super high durability of what xtep is known for (for their high class shoes)
- 208g in size US9.5/EU 43
- big biiig improvement to the 5.0 Pro
- for that price you get a loooooot of shoe

Con:

- supports only a very certain type of strike paddern
- heel cup basically not cushioned at all, means fit there is a yeah or ney
- runs longer than any other xtep shoe but sizing down makes them too narrow for the most, sizing down also makes the area you have to land even smaller

Neutral:
- firmer than expected, firmness reminds me a lot of the Vaporfly 3


Fit:

The upper is very very comfy and the tongue is the best tongue I have ever had in shoe, its super soft and cushioned, yet thin and not noticable. The 5.0 pro had the worst tongue ever made, now its the best.

They run a touch long, but sizing down makes them too narrow. And the area where you have to land gets even smaller. You have no slip, no movement, so I dont mind, but having a good thumb size room is new to me in xtep shoes.

Ride:

repoulsive, not super bouncy, but very high resilence and rebound, the ride reminds me a lot of the Vaporfly 3(have around 300km in different pairs in those), but with a stronger and earlier rocker.

I dont like to pretend anything, Iam too slow for that shoe. It feels the best below 4:30/km if you strike it perfectly you really get that crazy ""omph"" feeling which many of us remember as we tried our very first super shoe.
But its defintely not a nightmare to run in at slower paces like the 5.0 pro was. 
Compared to the fantastic 3.0 Pro it feels more like a modern super shoe and its almost 100g lighter overall.



Comparison (all shoes that I own):

Alphafly 3 - more suited for different strike padderns and feels more stable, 6.0 Pro feels more exciting to run in

Asics Metaspeed Sky Paris - feels more chaotic, less stable, is lighter but also easier to access in terms of foot strikes

Adios pro 3 - feels more like a trainig shoe 

Endorphin Elite - way firmer, way more stable, also needs a very certain strike paddern

Vaporfly 3 - very similiar ride in terms of resilence and propulsion, just less aggressive. 

Li-ning Feidian Ultra 4 - firmer, smother transition leading to a deep, soft springy toe off, requires a very clean running form.


Random stuff:

First real introduction was at Paris olympics, Wu Xiangdong run a 2:12:36 in them, which was Chinas fastest finish. 
The pi reinforced carbon plate is 30% lighter than regular modern carbon while also maintaining the same stiffness. And also features first shot-molded foam. Its really amazing, there are different softness levels through the foam without adding a new foam layer.

1gwytwt,RunningShoeGeeks,Brooks Glycerin 21 Review/450+mi,"Profile: 5’8”/130-135lbs, size 8.5 us M

Use Case: Easy Runs/Long Runs/Moderate Cut Downs/Strides

Best Use:  For me this is long runs or moderate cut downs.  The foam really feels great at 5:50-6:50 mi pace, it feels like the perfect amount of bounce to cruise through.  At recovery/slower speeds I don’t feel like I’m putting enough force into the foam to feel a nice bounce back but it’s still comfy.  At faster paces the stealthfit upper has too much give and weight/design just isn’t meant for that in my opinion.

They are solid for walking, which I mostly originally got them for/short recovery stuff.  But I really like them as daily trainers/long run shoes now.

If you try to absolutely blast hill sprints they will bottom out, the foam is fairly soft and unsurprisingly isn’t designed for max power impacts like a hill sprint.

Grip: I live in a very rainy climate, it’s decent.  Better than the ghost max/novablast 3 by a good margin, but falls short of adidas/puma grip.

Fit: Had no issues with TTS.  I usually only have issues with Nike/puma fit wise though.

Foam: Reminds me of Reeboks TPU stuff with a bit more bounce/softness.

Durability:  I am very light on shoes in general but it seems great.  The foam still feels 100%.  The outsole/upper are all fine, aside from some cosmetic wear.  I will continue using them until I feel they are toast.

Final Thoughts:  overall these are far more versatile shoes than I thought.  I’ve never done any true hard workouts in them, but I do think they’d do some threshold just fine in a pinch.  I’ve done several cut down long runs with the last 3-4mi in the 5:45-6:05mi range and they can move.

They are flexible and that is something I love in long run shoes.  There is a surprising amount of ground feel for this amount of stack but it is still at the end of the day a daily trainer first and foremost.

Please understand these are my experiences and i cannot guarantee that others will feel the same way.

1gw60zq,RunningShoeGeeks,Asics Gel Contend 8 quick review (≈50 miles of running),"Not seen these reviewed much, so here's info for anyone ever googling. They're a cheapo competitor to the Reebok Floatride Energy and Addidas Duramo. They have an 10mm drop (measured as 9mm on runrepeat) and a quite normal stack height of 22-32mm. Currently around £45-£50. I paid £37+postage, 6 months ago (early 2024). The Gel Contend 9 is already out now, but I haven't tried them.

About me: 63-70kg/140-155lbs, male. My feet are wide in the mid-foot (""extra wide"" according to the lady in Clarks). I have a hard time finding shoes that are wide enough (plus have a size discrepancy between my feet). Buying shoes stresses me out. Only other running shoe I've used are Kinvara 10. I half-heartedly ran cross country for a year at the end of high school (got kicked out of CC for non-attendance), then didn't run for years, besides warmups for other stuff. I had shin issues for 4 years, even when walking - I relearnt walking/running form and did shoeless running intervals (eg carefully jogging few hundred metres with good and stable form/stopped if pain increased, then walking a km), before starting to use shoes again after a couple months (my Nike Cortez sneakers and then Kinvaras. Saucony stability shoes hurt me considerably more). So I'm quite picky with shoes. I prefer to strengthen my muscles than have a comfortable shoe.

How I've used them:

* 5k runs on hilly sidewalks (in the 21-23:30 range, if it matters), 10k runs, uphill near-sprint repeats, horizontal near-sprint repeats, laps of grass field (up to 3km total). The weather varied from 10C-22C, dry and rain.
* I like their fit compared to my other shoes, so I started also walking in them. I've only used them for walking for a few months now, since I had knee/personal issues and stopped running. I walk in them several miles per week (on sidewalks), so easily 100+ miles of walking.

Fit and comfort:

* I got size 8.5. I usually wear size 8.5-9 shoes and bought size 9 as that's all they had in-store, but they were too big, especially for my smaller foot. They're wide in the midfoot.
* They have the heel locking lace holes.
* The upper isn't the most flexible, which can be good since they stay tied quite well (compared to my Kinvara 10s, which I usually retie every 7-10 minutes) and you know what you're getting. A downside is if your foot is too wide for the insole, you have nearly zero real estate to expand into, since the upper is inflexible so won't go wider than the insole. Also it makes them harder to quickly loosen up when putting them on.
* The tongue is thin and the laces can pinch you if you tie them tightly and are wearing non-thick socks - I've not felt it as much lately while walking in them, but I don't know if that's due to them improving or because I'm not running. Supposedly the Gel Contend 9 has a thicker tongue to address this issue.

Build quality of upper/laces:

* The upper isn't the strongest. I already put a small hole in it, due to having a habit of lifting my toe when walking/running. If you don't have that habit it won't happen (my Kinvaras have the same, but it took longer to happen). The shoe's overall structure is still good.
* I tie my laces tight and retie them repeatedly, but there are no signs of damage to them or to the lace holes (the laces are round btw, not flat).

Build quality of sole/inside:

* The tread of the sole still has its features intact.
* The inside of the shoe where your heel goes has a small amount of fraying in both shoes, which I've never noticed, until just now taking a closer look at them.

Sole grip:

* Excellent grip, both while running and now while walking. I walk a lot and worry about the grip of shoes, especially as it rains often in the UK and the pavements are covered in wet leaves. I feel quite safe in these shoes while walking or running, more than in any other shoes, excluding walking in actual non-slip safety boots.
* Kinvara 10s can lose traction when sharply turning a corner while running on a rainy pavement, but these don't.

Shoe performance:

* The first time I ran in these I didn't like them. They're loud on the pavement and didn't feel very responsive or natural, compared to the Kinvara 10 (which are a more minimalist and quite responsive shoe). I also felt like they were difficult to not heel strike in (whether that means not touching heel down at all, or just means touching the heel down last). I figured I would just use them for slow runs.
* HOWEVER, after that I've found them responsive enough (maybe I was just tired that first day) and they're perfectly good for doing speed work. I can definitely run fast in them.
* Compared to the Kinvara 10, these put more of a layer between your feet and the ground so you don't feel the ground as much. They're firm shoes.

1gvqvr5,RunningShoeGeeks,Perpetually increasing stack heights,"The post with the upcoming Vomero kind of solidified a thought I’ve been having lately—I think it’s really a shame that shoe companies seem to be in a race to the top, and keep increasing stack heights to outdo one another. What used to be daily shoes are now >40mm. 

It seems to me that trainers are eclipsing race shoes for a large segment of the market. The Zoom Fly 6, for example, is ostensibly meant to be a training companion to the Vaporfly. Yet it has a higher stack. Yes, it’s heavier, not as nimble, etc. But I’m still of the mindset that training in worse shoes is more beneficial, in order to get the most out of a race day shoe. But now companies encourage people to get used to running on a max-stack shoe which offers more cushion than race day options. At worst, I see this leading to injury. 

I’m not at all knocking anyone who chooses to train in these shoes. If they’re your jam, great. Not everyone wants to race and I get that, so whatever gets you out the door and enjoying your run is the absolute best shoe. That said, I do think it’s a shame that companies are pruning their lower stack options in favor of these maximalist shoes. It does suck to pass on daily shoes because they’re taller than what I can race in. I think Saucony and On are two of the best right now in terms of more traditional options.

Product Details:

As the lowest-stacked sibling of the adidas adizero racing family including the Takumi Sen, Adios Pro, and Adios Pro Evo, the Adios 9 is a razor-honed flat to destroy 3K to 10K races and track workouts. The headline update for this version is the full-length Lightstrike Pro superfoam midsole, removing any usage of Lightstrike 2.0. Also gone are the EnergyTorsion Rods 2.0, in favor of a simple and effective midfoot nylon shank. Together, these changes yield higher energy return and significantly greater flexibility.

The new Micro Fit upper's soft one-way stretch material flaunts enhanced comfort, while the integrated LIGHTLOCK band and Slinglaunch heel ensure foot security with minimal materials. Lastly, the new Lighttraxion GCPU outsole reduces weight to an absolute minimum, while retaining a sticky Continental rubber toe-off patch.

However you choose to say ""goodbye"" add the adidas adizero Adios 9 to your racing stable to confidently back up your words on race day.

1guc7gz,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Mach X 2 - Review after 30km .. Wow,"**My profile:** (if you need it before the TLDR)

6' / 175lbs / heel-to-midfoot striker / 3:44 MP & 1:40 HMP & run about 40-50km/week

Recent shoes : Novablast 4 / Endorphin Pro 3 / CBoston 12 (retired), I was specifically looking for a replacement for the Boston 12

TLDR; Wow, this is by far the best ride I have ever had in a shoe. I specify ride cus the fit needs work, but wow I've never enjoyed running in a shoe this much.

**Runs so far:**

As I usually do with a new shoe, I did a 10km progression run with paces ranging from 6:00min to 4:00min splits. Next day did an easy 5km at recovery pace with my partner. And just finished a 15km run with 12km at tempo (4:45 split).

In general I plan on using this shoe for my tempo / threshold runs, and some long runs when I want to include a bit of speed.

**Ride:**

Amazing, incredible, I have no words. I mostly heel-strike, unless I’m doing speed work. The transition from heel to toe is incredibly smooth, and the toe-off is powerful. The shoe feels bouncy and fast due to the top layer of race foam, but the firmer training foam at the heel gives it a good sense of control. They’ve mentioned the plate is mostly for stability, and I can definitely feel the foam is “restricted” to a certain area thanks to it, giving good (albeit not great) stability. But it also feels like it snaps back and propels you forward pretty well as well.

Maybe the only thing I would say is that the toe-off is “too powerful”, if that even counts as a negative. Running at a 6min split was actually difficult, I felt I was fighting the shoe, and my knees were feeling it. Honestly anything less than a 5:15 split (my “not) felt like I was fighting the shoe. It’s really meant to go at a good pace.

**Fit:**

This is where it struggles more. It’s a Hoka shoe so it fits snug. I personally like it, I don’t like having too much room in my shoe, doesn’t feel agile. Especially for a super-trainer such as this. Upper feels light and breathable, but not “cheap” and rough like some other racing uppers for trainers (looking at you Boston 12).

Now for the heel-counter and heel fit altogether. It sucks. The reviews weren’t wrong, that’s why I made sure to try it out in a shoe-store first before buying it, and I would recommend that you do too. But I’ll go a little bit more into details as to “why”, at least for me.

The heel counter is very flimsy and provides very little support. To remediate that, Hoka put 2 “pads” in the middle of the collar to squeeze around your achilles and avoid heel lift / slip. The thing is, it works. But your heel still WANTS to slip or lift, and whenever it does, you really feel those pads dig into the skin around your achilles to hold it in place. This creates what feels like rubbing or sliding, but I’ve noticed it doesn’t actually cause any chafing or pain, it just feels weird. Which is still annoying, but I’ll live with it if it means I can run on this amazing midsole.

**Final thoughts:**

Go try this out in a shoe store before you buy it, or make sure you have a good return policy. The heel fit may be a deal breaker for you. However, if it isn’t, then you’re in for an incredible ride. This isn’t just my favorite super-trainer on the market, it’s my favorite shoe.

Edit: Also, in case anyone was wondering, a runner's not did help the heel pad issue! Not completely removing it, but definitely helping.",2024-11-18 18:48:54+00:00,44,37

1gtl8tu,RunningShoeGeeks,NB 1080v13 400+mi Review,"Hey everyone, I figured I’d write this as the v14 have come out so I’m sure a bunch of people will be picking these up for cheap and there weren’t very many long term reviews of this shoe when I originally bought it.

About me:
Weight when I bought this shoe about 195
Current about 180
1.5mi - 10:03
5k - 22:18
10k - 54
Half M - 2:03
Full M - 4:39
Other shoes - NB SC Trainer v3

Why I bought this shoe: 
This was my first real running shoe that I bought when I started running around March/April. I was having some ankle/calf pain as I live in a hilly neighborhood and wanted something to soak up miles and I could also wear for my Sept marathon.

Upper:
Very comfortable and plush. Pretty warm but it didn’t bother me much. Never got lace bite. 

Footbed:
I got a standard width and it was fine. Didn’t feel tight or loose. I had some blistering issues on the outside of my big toe but thinner insoles fixed that. However when you pull the insole a lot of the shoes plushness is lost.

Ride:
Very comfortable and has decent bounce. I’d say they are not very stable. They aren’t bad if you forefoot striker but a heel striker might have some issues. I have run up to a 7:20ish mile and done hill sprints in these and they have never felt slow or like running in sand. When I first started I felt like they were TOO fast if I’m honest. That could be more because I wasn’t good at controlling my own pace though.

Durability:
It’s been solid so far. Haven’t had any issues with degradation and the outsole has held up great.

Overall:
I like these shoes a bunch. They’re super comfortable and I they make recovery miles easy, BUT… I had a lot of issues with blistering on the outside of my big toe and eventually started getting them on the ball of my foot. This was after 4-6weeks of wear (180-200ish miles) and I started to get desperate for a fix as nothing I tried worked. It was extremely frustrating to spend $200 on shoes and experience this. What eventually worked for me was buying Wright double layer socks, superfeet insoles, and lots of aquaphor. This combination along with a second pair of shoes to rotate solved the blistering, though today, if I’m going to run more than 4 miles I wouldn’t wear them solely off of fear of more blisters.

Would I buy again?
Honestly, I have no idea. On one hand I think they’re good all around shoes. On the other idk if these are worth it when you add the cost of insoles. If I could get them for, say, $75 ($125 after insoles) with the knowledge I’d only wear for short recovery runs, then I guess. Idk if I would recommend them for to anyone else though.",2024-11-17 19:19:20+00:00,90,50

Weight: 165 lbs / 75 kg
Size: 10 US

I picked these shoes up from sierra, on sale for $59.99. Seemed like a great deal and I think the colorway is dope.

Once I got them, I took my dogs for a couple of 1 mile walks to break them in. They felt great, super cushioned and a little bouncy. The heel and tongue are nicely padded. Toe box mesh is a little stiff feeling but has adequate room. 

Then today I went for my first run and oooh boy…it sucked haha. 

Within about 10 seconds I thought “these feel way thinner than when I was walking”. I quickly realized that I was compressing all the foam way before all of my weight was on my foot. After about a mile, my calves and the muscles in my feet were getting tired from trying to soften the impact of my feet hitting the road. Felt like running in minimalist shoes. 

I have a cheap pair of under armor shoes that I have been running in that are way too firm, but at least I’m not bottoming out in them. 

So yea, these are great walking shoes but I will not be running in them again.",2024-11-17 02:22:42+00:00,59,34

I’m 170 lbs, wear a size 10, and am a midfoot striker. I picked up this shoe for training runs of 6 to 13 miles at around a 9-minute pace.



This wasn’t the first shoe I tried on. Being 15% more expensive and 15% heavier than the competition it is not really on top of any list. However, the alternatives were either too soft for me - compromising my ankle stability - or didn’t provide enough forefoot protection, making them not great for longer training runs. I previously logged most of my long miles in the Superblast, but I wanted to switch things up after the last training block.



Kicked modest 8 miles in this shoe today on tired legs at about a 9-minute pace. The shoe had rewarding energy return throughout. It felt stable enough to swirl around food carts and tree planters and had great traction when I had to stop abruptly at a crossing light. The roll forward is my absolute favorite part of the shoe! It has no mid-foot cutout so there is no weird breaking mid stride; the ramp is present but subtle helping you forward but still leaving enough foam directly under the toes. At mile 6 I started noticing the weight - it’s definitely not a nimble shoe, particularly on uphills. That said, I don’t mind having a heavier shoe in my rotation as a daily training.



After my cooldown, I walked another mile while running errands, and I didn’t once feel like I was wearing a running shoe. It felt stable and predictable. So, it would be my pick for a travel week where it could double as an airport shoe. Size 10 fits me generously and with a thicker sock in current cold weather I had no blisters or rubbing on the first run. The upper is heavy as the rest of the shoe, but at least it didn't need much of fiddling with laces to get a good fit.



I don't think it is a recovery or highly cushioned shoe at all; for me, it’s firmly in the daily trainer category. Something like the Endorphin Speed would be better for threshold runs but wouldn’t handle long runs as well. The Superblast is a better option for even longer runs, like 20 milers. The NB4 would be the direct competition and is for sure a technically superior and a cheaper shoe. But as a midfoot striker, I found it has most of the foam where I don't actually need it and the midfoot cutout makes for a jagged transition for me.",2024-11-16 17:01:06+00:00,34,8

1gsfbhe,RunningShoeGeeks,Asics GlideRide Max,"Stats: 75-80kg BW. 22:34 5K, 53:13 10K. Typical do ultras (50+ miles) Avg pace anywhere from 11:20-13:30. On avg 50+ MPW. Size 9. Midfoot/Heel strike. 

Looks: After lookin at different colorways for other shoes in the Asics lineup I’m hoping they can manufacture more “fun” colors than the 3 current offerings. The white attracts a lot of dirt and is a pain to clean. I changed out the default black laces for white longer laces and it looks better. 

Feel/Fit: Ive had my fair share of Maximalist shoes (Glycerin Max, Skyward X, Ghost Max 1&2, VIA Olympus 2. None of these shoes gave me the right “Cinderella step in feel” I need from a pair of daily max trainers. After attempting a 100 miler with the Glycerin Max (DNF @ 84 due to metatarsal flexor inflammation) I went back to fleet feet and did a return. Talking to the employee they understood immediately what I needed and brought me out the GRM. I thought it was the Nimbus and a little reluctant. Upon putting these on all my doubts and worries went away. They fit on my feet as if I had worn them for months. I’m a size 9 in Glycerin 21 and Max, so same size for the GMR. 

While on the move: The rocker stabilizing the midsole giving more bounce and responsive than say a nimbus or Glycerin. The smoothness of the rocker allows for easier heel to toe transitions and more efficiency. Overall these shoes can excel at a myriad of paces. I used these for a 15 mile long run and had no issues, no heat spots and no issues overall. 

Final Score 4.2/5
Some hiccups in terms of shoe lace bite (they’re a bit short for the styling of the shoe) led to not being a 5/5. Overall these are fantastic for recovery runs or longer runs (especially if you’re a slower pace runner such as myself). Just need more colors ASAP Asics! ",2024-11-16 04:21:12+00:00,137,82

1gs61u1,RunningShoeGeeks,Saucony Endorphin Pro 4 review after 50 miles,"**Total distance ran:**

50 miles (80 km)

**Type of runs:**

Easy runs (8:00-8:30/mile), steady runs (7:20-7:40/mile), threshold repeats (6:20-6:30/mile). All on roads.

**My profile:**

Height: 6’0”

Weight: 160lbs

Weekly mileage: 65-70 miles (\~108km)

Strike Type: Midfoot

**Overview:**

I've been using the Saucony Endorphin Speed 3 as my do-it-all shoe for much of the year, logging hundreds of miles across two pairs, but am no longer able to find them in my size. So I decided to buy the Endorphin Pro 4 as their replacement. 

Like the ES3, the EP4 are lightweight and have a comfortable upper. But compared to the ES3, the rocker and energy return feels much subtler. This was most noticeable during a staple workout I do during marathon training: 4x2 miles at threshold pace. I didn't feel like I was getting a ton of assistance from the shoes, but instead was having to earn every rep. 

So while I've enjoyed the EP4 at easy and moderate efforts, there just seems to be something about the shoe's geometry and my foot strike that makes it difficult to maintain marathon (or faster) pace. 

**Positives:**

* Fit is true to size
* Comfortable, lightweight upper
* Outsole durability

**Negatives:**

* Cartoonishly long laces
* Middling energy return

**Worth buying?:**

It depends on how someone plans to use them. These'll be a great lightweight daily trainer for me. But I can't see myself ever using them for a marathon and would instead reach for more aggressive offerings like the Alphafly or Adios Pro.

\- Tried to go on a MUCH faster pace in them (4:45-5:00 per KM) and that's where they kind of shined, the foam + the plate was super comfortable. They felt absorbent and springy and made each stride so much easier  
\- They're super lightweight, genuinely surprised when I got them in the mail as I thought it was just the box and someone stole my shoes  
\- The upper feels kinda crinkly and feels a bit wide for me (I have narrow feet)  
\- They fit true to size (at least for me)  
\- The insole is glued in, and I tried to remove them and they just wouldn't budge  
\- This colorway is gorgeous, I adore it (I could also be just super biased towards blue)  
\- The tongue is not gusseted and is SUPER thin (not my preference, I like some padding)  
\- VERY minimal heel padding  
\- The heel is VERY narrow, so it kinda feels tippy both horizontally (narrowness) and vertically (shoe geometry)  
\- Did a rough measurement of the thickest part of the midsole, it's at least 45mm of stack height

Let me know if you have any other questions that I can answer

1grjnfu,RunningShoeGeeks,First Run Adidas Adizero Adios Pro Evo 1 - NYC Marathon,"So, after a stroke of luck (or madness?), I managed to get my hands on a pair of Adidas Adios Evo Pro 1s from Running Warehouse just a day before the New York Marathon. My goal was a sub-3-hour finish, something I haven’t achieved since running in the OG Vapor Fly 1s three years ago. Here’s my take on these hyped “mega shoes.”

Sizing and Fit
I usually run in Adizero Boston 12s (US 8) as my daily trainers, and these definitely run narrower. I had to go up half a size to avoid foot cramp, but even then, the fit felt a bit off. The lacing was tricky—I just couldn’t get them to sit right and had to keep adjusting, leading to rubbing that haunted me through most of the race. Unfortunately, the tongue also dug into my foot enough to cause light bleeding, partly because I wore low socks. Not ideal.

Performance
When it comes to performance, these shoes are insanely light and built for speed; they definitely have a “let’s go fast” feel. Up to about mile 16, I was on pace for a 2:56 finish, which says something. However, I found the ride pretty firm, and eventually, between the overall discomfort of the fit and the firmness of the ride, my mechanics took a bit of a pounding. Ignoring the pain became challenging, and my rhythm fell off. The energy return is solid, but it’s not quite the plush or forgiving feel I’ve had with other super shoes.

Verdict
So, would I spend $500 again on these? Or run another marathon in them? I don’t think so. They have some serious speed potential but feel a bit too inaccessible from a comfort perspective, and I’m not sure they’re ready for a mainstream marathon crowd just yet.

I’ve run in several Nike super shoes and Asics Metaspeeds, and honestly, I’m not sure the Adidas Adios Evo Pro 1s match up in terms of a prosumer-friendly experience. For anyone considering these, unless you’re an elite, I’d say proceed with caution.",2024-11-15 00:24:57+00:00,164,50
1gr1a7m,RunningShoeGeeks,Instant relief after replacing insoles in Nike Vaporfly 3,"I know this shoe has been out for a while now, but I managed to pick up for £100 in the UK which is a big discount from £240 RRP.

When putting it on first time and walking around, I knew I was going to have trouble with the arches. I went for a quick jog and it felt horrible.

My foot isn't flat, but I could just feel my foot spilling over the narrow insole and the exposed midsole pushing up into my arch in every step. I'd seen google results of arch blisters and definitely didn't want that.

If I'd paid full price I would have returned these, but as I got them quite cheap, I thought I'd experiment to make it work for me as I've always wanted to try a carbon plate shoes.

I pulled out some insoles of some On shoes I had lying around, and they seemed a good match; wider at the arch area. At first I tried overlaying the insole, but it didn't feel right. I then ripped out the glued insole of the Vaporfly (I knew it'd be massively devaluing the shoes so there was no going back).

Once the On insole was in, it was instant relief. I took it out for a 5k run, and had no more issues. I could still feel slight pressure in the arch, but not enough to cause pain or discomfort. 

Look forward to getting some more use out of them and hopefully some PBs

1gqdt1a,RunningShoeGeeks,Asics Novablast 4 - my take after 1000 km,"**How are you, my fellow runners?**

I want to share my thoughts about Novablast 4, which I now consider one of the best buys I have made. I paid the retail price, and I don't regret it! If you have any questions, please feel free to ask!

**Purpose**

I needed a shoe to prepare for my half-marathon. It became my main choice for almost every training unit besides the fastest intervals. Novablast 4 made me feel quick and unbothered on long distance. Fast, moderate, and slow units worked perfectly for me. I love the push-off , the shock absorption and the effortless running feeling which was at its best for the first 500 km. I find the foam doing its job as stated by the producer. I don't see it being overhyped at all. Well, all the more reason I find it a good choice for someone considering buying their first running shoes. I have managed to do my longest 30km run in these and my feet were very thankful.

**Fit**

I found them almost perfect, true to size. As an ectomorph, I have a long, slim feet and I remember having a corn once or twice, but probably because of wrong socks. I have a feeling that thick socks do not work well with these shoes. If you like this combination I would recommend going at least half a size up. Your feet might feel a bit claustrophobic. My pronation is quite neutral as you can see in the sole comparison picture.

**Longevity and materials used**

With an emphasis on ""durability,"" my pedantic soul is so satisfied. I was running 70% asphalt and 30% soft gravel. They have no scuffs or scars. Shoes still have a lot of life in them, even if the foam is not as responsive and spongy, as it was before. Let's see how long it will take to retire this pair. I bet another 500km or 1000km. Also after the running journey, I'm sure they will be more than ready for casual usage.

**TL:DR**

Durable, versatile, good-looking, worth your hard-earned money. Good for first-timers.

If you can grab it for 100-110$, don't hesitate, it is a steal.

1gpevqm,RunningShoeGeeks,Hoka Mach 6 - 1500km review (over 2 pairs),"M 6ft2 87kg Mar: 2:58 HM1:26 

Recently hit around 1,500km in my Mach 6 journey (for reference first pair got to about 1,000km and second pair at just over 500km). I unfortunately don’t have my first pair anymore so the pictures are the second pair at 500km for reference. So my thoughts on the shoes for anyone considering them. 

So before anything, clearly I like this shoe. I’ve had 2 pairs and will probably get a 3rd so for me they work. So will mostly be a positive review but there are some areas I don’t like them for so will discuss those as well. 

How I have used the shoe and what I feel they do well at: 
I have had 3 main uses for them. 
1) when I’m home my workout shoe and long run shoe. If I’m doing something a bit shorter like 10x1km I might go for an old race shoe but for works out that are longer (such as 4x5km at x pace) I will grab these. 
2) the Swiss Army knife shoe. I travel a lot for work so whenever I go if I just wanted to put on 1 pair of shoes and it be able to handle pretty much everything this will be it. 
3) non peak races. Have also used it for a few races that I’m not chasing a time as well as when helping pace a friend. Have done 3:10 Marathons all the way to 4:50 marathons in them so have handled a range of paces. 

There are a lot of reviews on them so won’t dive into the detail about them to much but in summary. Fit is normal Hoka size (half a size up from my normal size for me). Upper is not the most plush upper but found it comfortable with no blisters/hot spots/rubbing etc. midsole will chat about below and durability I think has been very good. 
Worth noting I tend to be very light on my shoes (in terms of visual wear) so my shoes tend to die in terms of midsole before they look beaten up. So not sure how others will cope but for me has been good. 

A bit more on the feel and how they last. In one sentence would say “good energy return with enough cushion for most runs while not being overly soft”. They tend to feel very soft when walking or standing in them but find they stiffen up a bit when running so you not sinking into them. How the midsole last. 
0-50km found they took about 50km just to settle in and find their sweet spot. Still bouncy and responsive during this time. 
50-500km the real sweet spot where they work best. 
500-1000km a general decline and start to loose their pop. Mine just got softer and softer so they never really hardened up (but did start to feel dead in longer runs on 20km plus). So take that as you will. 

What I did not like these for: 
- Recovery shoes - just not the type of shoe I would use. They fine but not the most comfortable so don’t slip them on and your feet are thanking you for the comfort (how I would like recovery shoe to be). 

- daily shoe: maybe a bit of a contra opinion here but I didn’t like using them for MY dairy runs. What I specifically mean by that is during a week about 3 to 4 runs are just easy, cruising at around a 5:30 (per kilometer) pace. Now they can certainly handle this fine but the shoes I like for this are pretty much the same as my recovery shoe. Specifically shoes that are extremely comfortable. But this is just for my runs, they can no doubt be a daily shoe if you looking for one. 

So who are they for? 
Well clearly first option is someone whose looking for exactly what I do and use them for. 
Otherwise if someone is looking for a “do it all shoe” or if you looking for a race shoe and don’t want to go carbon I think they worth looking at. 

Lastly if you considering them as a marathon or ultramarathon shoe I would just take note. They certainly fine and can do the job but for my height and weight I found they start to feel like they were bottoming out a bit once I hit the 30km plus mark. Wasn’t a massive issue and didn’t cause any pain but just felt that was about the upper end of where the pop felt like it was really thriving. But again I did a 56km ultra in them and they were fine but wouldn’t be my first choice again for this type of race.

Some alternative if you not wanting Hoka or want other options. Puma deviate nitro, Saucony speed series, NB Rebel, ASICS Superblast (never owned a Superblast but throwing it based on the hype around them). 

Happy to answer any questions!

1gpebv4,RunningShoeGeeks,"Cheap Alphafly 2s, oops","Bought not one but two pairs of cheap (compared to retail price) Alphafly 2s. I promised to not wear them until I get faster, but got a little trigger happy when I cut a minute off my 1k interval pace last month. 

Busted out one of the pairs for a 8 mile run. Normally I would wear a Pegasus 41 for this run or maybe my Vaporfly 3s (which I absolutely love love love)

One mile in I thought hmm, these are really stiff. 

Two miles in I thought I probably need to get some speed to feel these do their thing. 

Four miles in I thought hmm inner arch is feeling some rub. 

Six miles in I thought holy crap am I going to have to DNF my run because of these shoes?

Eight miles in I was full of regret.

These shoes absolutely tore up my feet. 2-3 inch inner arch blisters on both feet. Heel rubbing tore skin open too. Serious pain in one foot. Absolute disaster. 

(I run 20-30 miles a week and haven't gotten blisters from any shoes in 10 years)

I searched this sub and found mentions of taping down or cutting out that inner arch insole flap that rides up. So I taped it up and also the heel. 

Went out for a second run for 6 miles after a 9 day recovery to heal the damage.

Second run was way better from a pain standpoint and I guess the shoes felt okay but still feel stiff, bordering on clunky. 

I've got 30 miles on them and today another 5 mile tempo run that resulted in a new batch of blisters, even with tape inside the shoes.

I'm blown away by how BAD these shoes are for me. Especially considering how close to perfection the Vaporfly 3 is, and how decent other Nike shoes are for me.

Lesson learned, always buy shoes from an outlet that accepts returns after a test run. Other lesson: what other people love isn't necessarily what you will love. ",2024-11-12 06:12:42+00:00,37,25

1goltwp,RunningShoeGeeks,Mizuno Neo Vista 150km+ Review,"Ever since these shoes released I've wanted a pair. They're like just about nothing else on the market aesthetically and I have become a big fan of the max cushion offerings coming into the running world of late, especially the ones with some go in them. I was never a fan of the original blue colourway but when my local shop finally got this colourway in stock, I had to pull the trigger. I've done three 30k runs in them plus more shorter runs but nothing below 10-12k.

Background: 30yo male, 65kg, midfoot striker, usually race over ultra distance but have a 5k pb of 17:30 and 10k of 35:56. 

The look: as mentioned above, I absolutely love the styling of the shoe. I either go very subtle or completely out there with my shoe colour choices and this is definitely in the subtle but fun category. The pink strip at the back and the 'glittery' midsole look awesome. They definitely feel and look a little basketball shoe like when you first put them on but you get used to it. I think it's a shoe that you would either love or hate aesthetically, and I absolutely love it n

The midsole: plush, just absolute plush. So much cushion, but also enough responsiveness and pop thanks to the foam and plate to stop them feeling sluggish and give them a bit of a fun factor. It's the sort of shoe that will just eat up easy kilometres but also one that turns your easy 5:15 pace recovery run into a 4:45 pace not recovery run. Once you get into rhythm, they are just buttery smooth. I did take them for an interval session but found them to feel quite clunky at paces below 4min/k. That shouldn't be an issue for anyone though since that sort of pace is not what this shoe was made for. No issues with instability or hot spots/blisters, they were good for me straight out of the box. 

The outsole: so far so good. The wear pattern looks about right and there is still plenty of rubber to burn through. I've had no issues with getting things caught in the cut out in the sole and it is also unnoticeable for me on the run, if all it is is a weight saving technique, I'm here for it. I haven't been out with them in the wet so I can't comment on their grip. 

Conclusion: I love this shoe. I look forward to long run days of which there have been plenty lately. I've not experienced this feeling in a shoe, it's the perfect balance for me between being super plush and cushioned but having enough pop to make them enjoyable for long runs whilst leaving the legs feeling as fresh as can be. Would buy again! ",2024-11-11 06:22:35+00:00,156,60

1god5su,RunningShoeGeeks,Brooks Glycerin Max,"Coming from a long-time Brooks doubter, the Glycerin Max are the real deal. Wanted something new in the rotation and went to my local running store to try out the Glycerin Max, Mach X 2’s & Zoom Fly 6’s. Only had the GMax & MX2’s in store, but the GMax intrigued me immediately. 

The stack is noticeable - the ride is super plush but oddly responsive for a max cushion shoe. Took it out for a 5 miler right out of the box at Marathon pace & the ride was fun & enjoyable the whole way through! The only time I noticed them was on steeper inclines where you feel the 11oz weight to them. 

For the pricetag of $200, it’s hard to compete with the Superblasts, Endorphin Speeds, & Novablasts of the world, but the GMax’s find their niche as a great recovery day shoe that can be used daily. To me, this is a better version of the Nike Invincibles. ",2024-11-10 22:43:45+00:00,355,117

I recently retired my previous trainers (Saucony Triumph 22s) after 350+ miles. I decided to pick up the ZF6 when it released.

Now, I’m not the best at describing the various attributes of a good running shoe like some of otherposts do so I’ll save some of the details. What I can describe is how they felt.

My profile (sorry ladies I’m taken) male 32, 200 ibs, size 11 US. Used to be a bit of a bigger runner 😂. 

**These. Shoes. Freaking. Slap** I took these out for what was supposed to be an anaerobic workout. High intensity for one 1 min, 3 min cool down, rinse and repeat until my Garmin says I’m done. The shoes felt great on the initial 15 min warm-up. The energy return was something I haven’t felt with my old trainers. Springy, light, and comfortable. The ZoomX foam is no joke and made the ride extraordinary. 

My legs did not get tired at all. I ended up running the last mile at my 10K pace (8:00) even though my Garmin yelled at me for going too fast. I was literally saying “Wow” as I cruised back home in my fancy boy shoes.

1gnrgba,RunningShoeGeeks,Adizero EVO SL - initital thoughts,"I picked these up recently and wanted to provide some feedback based off of the first few runs, for two reasons: one, to let people know this is *not* a $150 racer replacement, and two, to alleviate some of their anxiety in not getting one before next spring.

Here's my thoughts so far, after taking 'em out for 9 miles and some 400m intervals at 80s:

**Size**: I bought these blind, and went with my usual Adidas size (9.5M). It works, but they are snug. I heard the last was based off of the Boston 12, but these run markedly shorter. If the Adios pro 3s fit you perfectly and you have some room, I'd go with the same size. If your usual size in the Adios pro is snug, I'd consider going up half a size. The front near the toes is reinforced and very stiff--not something you'd want to hit your toes against for very long. The EVO SL is pretty much exactly the same size as my Prime X strung V1s, but they're much more padded around the heel, and I was a little surprised by how tight they were.

**Fit**: No complaints about the upper here. If you've lived through the misery of the Adios pro and Boston uppers, breathe a deep sigh of relief: they can't hurt you any longer. The upper fabric is a light mesh and is fairly smooth to the touch--no Adios 3 sandpaper here. The shoe is also much more padded around the heel, without the little bumpers you see on the other Adizero shoes. The heel cup is just one smooth surface and has a stiff heel counter. The rocker is noticeable on step-in and can make you feel like you're sliding forward if you're not locked in. I wouldn't wear these as a lifestyle shoe, but I'm positive others will anyhow.

Some people complained about tongue slipping; I didn't experience any of that. In fact, I would say that this tongue is just an outright better version of the one in the B12. It's not gusseted either, but it's less flimsy, feels broader, and has more padding, with better lace integration.

**Weight**: This weighs in at exactly 8.00 oz in my men's 9.5. For reference, that's about an ounce less per shoe than the Boston 12 or the PXS v1 in the same size. That weight loss is noticeable underfoot, as well: this is not a shoe that you really feel the heft of.

**Looks**: Let's get this out of the way. Yes, it has drip. Fine. It leaks. It sprays. It floods your entire kitchen and you have to call an emergency plumber. This is a good looking shoe, and you will feel like a good looking person wearing it. Prepare to see people who are not runners wear this everywhere. Moving on.

**Midsole**: Let's cut through the noise here and be honest about what you're getting: This isn't an EVO 1 at a third of the price; this is an Adios pro 3 with no rods, for a hundred bucks less. That's it. It has the bounce, but none of the snap of the carbon racers. Don't expect this to push you to up your pace the way the adios pro or pxs do, it's just not that kind of shoe. You lock in whatever pace you set, and the shoe gets out of the way. There is *some* ground feel, but it is fairly minimal. I think almost anyone could easily run HM distance training runs in this; a more svelte runner might be fine doing 20 miles or even the full 26.2. As with all lightstrike pro shoes, I expect it to soften up a little on break-in.

**The Ride**: The ride is pleasant and accommodating. It's not all marshmallows and molasses, there's a firmness to the bounce. If you're familiar with lightstrike pro (and who isn't by now), you know exactly what to expect here--fairly minimal sink in, quick rebound. It's firmer than a rebel v2, but softer than the Boston 12.  If Tracksmith were making this shoe, they'd call the ride 'peppy'. Given that this shoe is 2 oz lighter than the eliot runner and has a higher stack of foam, they'd actually be right. The rocker geometry is different from the others, and it is very noticeable, bordering on aggressive--it definitely promotes quick turnover. I ran a variety of paces from 9:30/mi to 5min/mi, and it felt right at about all of them. If you're clicking off anything faster than 5 min miles, I'd opt for something with carbon.

Stability-wise, I cut my teeth on the PXSv1, so the very concept of stability seems like a distant memory by now. If you heel strike, it might be a little squirrelly, but as a midfoot/forefoot runner, this felt easy as pie to run in.

**Value**: Here's where this shoe shines. Don't get me wrong: it's lovely, but look at your collection: you have other shoes that do things better already. Just not *at this price*. In my book, this shoe makes the Boston line obsolete. It's lighter, sports a better upper, is less firm in the ride, and costs  less! It may have less snap at speed, but I never got on with the Bostons at pace since I couldn't get my foot from slipping around and getting hot spots. Damn that shoe.

In short, I want to get ahead of the inevitable glazing: this shoe is neither a Superblast destroyer (it doesn't have the stack height) nor a Vaporfly killer (it lacks the speed); it's an up-and-down tempo daily workhorse, in a very fancy jacket. It's pretty, but it looks built to last too. If you love the adios pro 3, this is a no-brainer. If you liked the Boston 12s, this is their younger, better looking sibling. If you were hoping to replace your $300 Prime X strung v1s with this, stop lying to yourself, but have a hug. If you're anxious to get your hands on it, don't be. Put some comfy socks on, go run in your Adios pro 3s, and wait for spring.

After all, a lot of shoes can do what this shoe can; some can even do it better. None can do it at this price.",2024-11-10 03:23:28+00:00,259,94

1gmln9m,RunningShoeGeeks,Adidas Supernova Solution review (after 400km / 250 miles),"Hi guys,

I bought these in June. I went to a local running store for gait analysis, and they told me that I overpronate and should consider stability shoes. I took their advice and ended up buying a pair of the Adidas Supernova Solutions, because they were the most comfortable of the stability shoes I tried.

They were great for the first few weeks of training. I used them as a daily trainer and they felt comfortable and cushioned. I used them for long runs (up to about 23kms) and for easy runs.

At about 350km, they started giving me problems. When I ran for more than 20 mins, I would get sharp shooting pains in both legs which was quite alarming. I tried switching them out for another pair of shoes (Puma Deviate Nitro 3s) and my legs were fine. When I tried to run in the Supernova Solutions again, the shooting pains started again.

I'm not exactly sure what caused this, but it feels like the midsole on the Supernova Solutions wore down quite quickly, as they feel very hard to the touch now. It goes without saying that I had to stop running in them at about 400kms to avoid any pain or potential injuries. I'm normally able to get 800km+ out of a daily trainer, so was quite surprised that I'd worn these out so quickly.

I contacted Adidas to ask whether this was a known issue with the Supernova Solutions, and they claim it isn't and told me that they can't help.

I just wanted to warn others, because these shoes aren't cheap and, at least in my case, they didn't last long at all. I have carbon plated shoes which have lasted much longer.

Thanks.

1gltsko,RunningShoeGeeks,Adios Pro 4 - First run thoughts ,"Total distance ran:
4 miles. 

Fit:
take your normal running size. I tried 12.5 and 13….12.5 was very 1 to 1 in terms of fit but the toe reinforcement doesn’t make this very pleasant so immediately I knew it was too small. And this is coming from someone who likes their shoes to fit perfect! 13 was the move. I wear 13 in the alphafly 3, metaspeed sky, puma deviate 3 elite for reference. I got a 12.5 in the adios 3 and never had an issue but I should probably wear a 13 in that too😂

Type of runs:
Just Vibes. I hit 6:30 for the first 3, 6:22 for the last mile. Was comfortable. But I could tell I was giving a tad bit more effort than just chilling going for a stroll 

Weather ran in:
A Texas night. Around 70, clear and dry roads.

My profile:
Height: 6'2
Weight: 175lbs
Range of average cadence with this shoe: 158 steps/ min
Strike Type: forefoot mostly. I have a sprinter background. 
I run 3-4 days a week (2wice on Wednesdays). I probably never go over 30 miles a week. Stay around 20-25. I barely get 70 a month as of recently. Training for 10k’s, do half marathon training long runs on Saturdays though 

Positives:
I got to wear them a little early and stunt. Adios pro 3 was my favorite super shoe and the shoe I would pick if I couldn’t afford all of the shoes I get to try. This is the new version and runs quite similarly, although you do kind of get more of a bounce/ assistance. Where I feel like the adios, if you pound the ground harder, that’s how you get that return. By force: this you still had that of course but with less effort. Overall I enjoyed the shoe and will be taking them for 12 miles Saturday morning. Still has that signature adios feel if that’s what you are looking for. Upper is super comfortable. Great lockdown

**Negatives** : the graphic on the insole started to peel away and I could feel it on my socks as I was runningS almost like I had something in my shoe. A little annoying. They are also a bit unstable on the turns so be careful to slow down or turn really wide, especially if you have weaker ankles. 

**Overview** : Very good shoe. I was afraid it was gonna be too mushy and run slower but it was quite pleasant. I will report back after my 12 miles Saturday. A great follow up. Different from the 3 and evo pro 1 but still runs like it’s apart of the family. I don’t do reviews so ask specifics in the comments",2024-11-07 15:59:39+00:00,293,120
1glqtyc,RunningShoeGeeks,Adidas Evo SL First Run ,"Managed to get myself a pair of EVO SL's during the limited drop after the Cape Town Marathon in South Africa. I have the Adios Pro 3 and Boston 12's which have been amazing; the thought of a shoe with full Lightstrike Pro foam with no robs was just too enticing. 

**Fit & Comfort** \- I went half a size up as per my AP3's and Bostons and they fit perfectly. They are very comfortable...worlds apart from the Adizero shoes. This would actually be a great true to travel with as it is comfortable for walking and can easily handle any run. 

**Look & Outer** \- This shoe looks amazing and the materials look and feel quite premium. A lot more padding in comparison to the AP3's and Boston. 

**Midsole & Ride**  \- Lightstrike pro ! Need I say more; my favourite foam of all time. It feels like the same as the AP3's which feels great for slow and fast paces. The rocker is evident and propels you forward smoothly. If you are a heal striker; I would say you need to take caution; the heal may be unstable; similar feel to the AP3's. 

**Use** \- This is a do it all shoe in my opinion. It is what has been missing in the Adidas lineup. I did a 10km mixed run where I went slow, fast (Marathon and HM pace) and also did some walking. The route had some hills and downhills and flats.....the shoe handled all excellently. 

Can you use this for your tempo and speed sessions ? Yes but this is not its strength as it doesn't have that pop that you get from a plate or the rods. For runners in the front of the pack; this would be a up-tempo perfect daily trainer that pairs with your race shoe. For us middle of the pack runners; this can be your do it all shoe including for use in races. 

Will share more as I do more runs.....",2024-11-07 13:48:18+00:00,102,58
