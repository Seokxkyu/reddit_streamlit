1jwa4ek,handbags,Is it vintage coach?,"The general consensus is that it’s vintage coach. But what model? No tags that I am aware of but I found two of the same model online.

1jvykb4,handbags,Too gaudy?,"Question to all my handbag girlies 
I've recently gotten into handbags and have been on a constant search for a bag that I love and fits into my budget. 

After scouring poshmark, I found this vintage coach 7791 hampton satchel in good condition (at a steal!) that I loved and decided I needed to have. It's missing its strap to turn it into a crossbody which I'm fine with replacing but I knew I wanted to jazz it up a bit.

My question to all of you long time hand bag lovers, is this too gaudy? Too much? Should the chain be shorter or placed on a larger bag?

The more I look at it the more it's growing on me but I just wanted to see what others thought 😊",2025-04-10 13:58:06+00:00,15,11

This is the inside of a second hand Coach bag. What would be the best way to repair this? It seems like it’s some sort of gum stuck to the bottom that cannot be cleaned off.

I would like to purchase my first “luxury” handbag, currently I own couple of coaches and a Kate spade, which I love. But I recently became obsessed with Chanel. My budget is $10k. I’m looking for advice, 
1. which Chanel should I purchase? 
2. Should I go to pre loved route or brand new?
3. If going the pre loved route, which websites/ pages are the most reliable?

Note: Ideally I would like to buy 2 different staple bags for different times and season. Since my budget is $10k i understand purchasing 2 chanel bags may not be possible so i open to other brand recommendations. Please any advice is appreciated. 🙏 ",2025-04-10 01:07:28+00:00,3,17
1jvhx25,handbags,In search of the perfect small black bag (with gold hardware),"Hello everyone,
I'm looking for a small black bag with gold hardware that can go from day to night. 

I've been eying the Coach Quilted Tabby 20 and the Small Gucci Marmont, but I am definitely open to more suggestions and not set on a quilted bag! Ideally the bag should have atleast two handle options (e.g. shoulder bag to crossbody)

I usually gravitate towards other colors when choosing a bag, but I found that for more formal-ish events a black bag is kind of a must have.

Juliet Shoulder Bag in Dark Stone - Partial to the maple colour but there isn’t one in this style anymore. Love that it has a zip and generous shoulder drop!

Soft Tabby in Maple - I already have a black tabby bag (regular tabby) but heard good things about this leather and style. I like that it’s  more secure than the Brooklyn bags. Worried it’s a bit too dressy for an every day bag.

Brooklyn 28 in Maple or Honey Brown - I really do love these but don’t love the lack of security (no zip or top flap) and i think it leans trendy rather than classic. I’m a bit worried Honey Brown is too “yellow” for my skin tone (light brown/beige).

1jsiwia,handbags,Help me pick a crossbody/shoulder bag that’s good for casual outings and special occasions,"I want something that looks high quality, that can look cool with casual attire and relaxed luxe for special events. Which do you think gives off that vibe? Or maybe I already have that bag 😆 (Chloe Tess). I kind of want a box calf leather type of bag, maybe something like the Hermes Constance.

##The Idol Bag: 
I like it because of the smooth leather that’s box calf (oh patina), plus the magnet is super satisfying. But the shoulder chain strap I wish was a leather strap that can be adjusted to a shoulder strap.

##Time Square Tabby:
I like that the shoulder strap has a leather portion and it definitely can be an everyday bag as well as a special occasion bag. I also love the canvas interior. 

##Lee Radziwill Shoulder Bag:
I like that it can be adjusted as a shoulder or crossbody bag with just one strap.

It’s the Leather Medium Tanner Shoulder bag. The shape is reminiscent of styles like the Coach Brooklyn Shoulder bag and the red color caught my eye.

Unfortunately, I can’t find any reviews of this particular bag apart from the reviews on the retailer sites.

This year, I gave away two Coach bags (the only ones I had and the only high end brand in my collection) to relatives as gifts because after the initial few uses back in 2023 and maybe once or twice in 2024, I didn’t see myself reaching for them.

1jrj1kn,handbags,Work bag I can put my shoes in,"So I work a few days a week in an office space where I can’t really leave my shoes (partially because storage, partially because I have client meetings the rest of the week and need them!). I’m NYC based and commute via public transit and a lot of walking, so comfy shoes when commuting is a must (plus I don’t want to get crud on my shoes). 

I currently have [this tote](https://www.dagnedover.com/collections/classic-tote) from Dagne Dover, which I love for the size, the chain for my keys (lifesaver when I’m coming home and don’t want to fumble around in my bag), the pockets, and the water bottle holder. 

That being said- the bag isn’t really my style. Outside of work I tend more towards Beara Beara, Fable England, vintage Coach, London Fog, and even some more eclectic choices like a carpetbag for travel. I work in the history field so I can absolutely lean into that urge for me! I lean towards dark brown leathers and very classic styles- but it has to be able to close by zipper as well as fastening because when I travel I’ve run into pickpockets. 

What I usually have in my bag- granola bar, lipstick, concealer, compact, wallet, business cards, keys, water bottle, meds, and my kindle. I don’t need to schlep around a laptop but I do often have legal-size folders on me for documents, and sometimes do have regular books in it as well. I also usually have a small umbrella, a scarf, and some other odds and ends like a mending kit and such. My workdays are very long, as is my commute, so I need to have all my stuff with me.

I am really wanting a big slouchy maroon tote (similar to my black Coach Brooklyn, but more maroon less red than their current available colors). I went to Etsy because I would really like to support smaller artisans, and I couldn’t decide between a few listings till I noticed these two listings are almost identical, but from different stores… They look to be identical bags which wouldn’t be too crazy but they also come with what looks to be identical complementary canvas pouches? Am I paranoid or is this a red flag? I know Etsy is sometimes bad about allowing drop shippers parading their items as “hand made” when they are just like bought off sites like ali express but I didn’t think that would be a thing for bags… I just want to make sure I’m supporting a real business and getting an actual handmade bag. What do y’all think? Am I over thinking this or should I avoid these listings? ",2025-04-03 20:49:17+00:00,2,10

1jqkjuo,handbags,Best place to buy a nice but affordable bag in NYC?,"Hi everyone,

I’ll be visiting New York City soon (for a week), and I’d love to buy a beautiful bag while I’m there—but nothing too expensive. I’d say my budget is around 300 euros (about the same in USD). I’ve been looking at Kate Spade and COACH (some bags I like: Hadley, Rowan Large, City Tote Bag, Andrea Carryall), partly because they’re brands originally from New York.

I’m from the Netherlands, and even at outlet stores here, the prices are much higher. I noticed that there aren’t any outlet locations in NYC itself. My question is: would you recommend ordering a bag from the COACH outlet website and having it delivered to a pickup point in NYC (I have no experience with this in the U.S.), or should I just visit a store and find one there?

Also, if you have any other suggestions for bags, brands, or stores, I’d love to hear them!

Thanks in advance!",2025-04-03 14:54:20+00:00,4,21

1jqd07l,handbags,Need 15 inch laptop shoulder tote that zips!,"Hi all, I’m looking for a nice dressy leather shoulder tote that is large enough to hold a 15 inch laptop and zips across the top. I either find ones that are too small, made out of nylon and look too casual, don’t stand up on their own, don’t have shoulder straps, or don’t zip across the top. 

I travel to a few conferences a year and want to have something that looks dressy with the rest of my professional outfit and that fully zips so that when I travel on the plane nothing falls out of it. 

I need room for the 15 inch laptop (does not need a special padded sleeve, just large enough to accommodate 14.5 inches wide and 10.5 inches tall), one or two full-size standard notebooks, and a handful of accessories like pens, a phone charger, Post-it notes, presentation clicker, and my business card holder. Bonus points for interior pockets, but I could deal with an exterior pocket that holds smaller items as long as it also zips. 

I feel like I’m Goldilocks and I can’t find a nice dressy bag that holds a larger computer. I tried ordering some off of Amazon, I tried looking at coach and coach outlet, I tried at Nordstrom, and even looked around a lot online and still can’t find one that fits those specs.

I’m so appreciative of any suggestions! Thank you!",2025-04-03 08:25:19+00:00,2,5

I wonder if there is a more elevated and elegant looking bag that can achieve the same goal? Something that fits a lot more than it would suggest, is secure (le Pliage has the zip closure which is great), and is durable. 

My budget is £1000, although I wonder if part of the appeal of the Le Pliage is that it is cheaper and so I feel like i don’t need to baby it.

If you carry similar items in this bag, would you please share how they fit (is it at capacity, misshapen, etc) or even share a picture? I don’t have stores that carry this brand near me and would like to avoid the hassle of a return so I’d appreciate any advice! ",2025-04-01 12:27:39+00:00,3,2

1jo3c0k,handbags,Is this normal for Coach?,"I recently (3 months ago) bought my very first Coach bag, and i have to say that i’m so disappointed in the quality. My bag is the Coach hobo crossbody in black with gunmetal hardware.

The metal parts started chipping after just a couple of months, and at this point the chipping is very noticable. The metallic layer, and even the brass is showing underneath. The bag comes with three different straps, and one of the short straps has already broken stitching. I cannot justify this level of wear and tear after just three months for almost a 400€ handbag 🥲

I don’t have much experience with quality/designer handbags, but i did some research and found out that Coach has very good quality for the price point.
The grossgrain leather seems to be durable, but good quality leather only helps so much if everything else is falling apart. 

Is this normal for Coach, or did i just get a faulty bag?",2025-03-31 13:35:23+00:00,59,66

1jl4wa8,handbags,lil dumpling treat 👛,"I had no intention of buying a bag the other day, and admittedly am not a big Kate Spade fan (this is my first), but I saw her in the window as I walked by and I couldn’t resist!!! I love purple, and don’t have any other ‘croc’ bags so that solidified it for me. 

This is the mini dumpling bag and I paid $90. The leather is beautiful up close and it fits more inside than I would expect for a mini bag (everything pictured + hair clip, iPhone 15 pro, cash, and business cards easily). It’s not quite as soft and supple as some of my Coach bags or Furlas, but that could be due to the texture and structure as well. It doesn’t fully close on the top, just a clasp, so it did make me a little nervous carrying it on the subway last night; maybe only a bag for driving/ubering nights (city girls get it).

Overall I think the bag is really cute and will definitely be worn as it matches well with my closet. $90 is probably the top price I’d pay for it but I don’t have any buyers remorse. 

End of my unprompted review; my irl friends don’t love handbags as much as y’all do so I wanted to share!

If I need to carry a bottle, a snack or a cardigan, it's always a hassle with a smaller bag. So I picked this one because it has a shoulder strap, the main fabric is recycled synthetic therefore less fragile than leather.

1jkn5pi,handbags,Help a purse noob!,"Hello!!! I'm one of those girls who always just used little backpacks or random purses .. prior to COVID a tried buying my first big girl purse from Kate Spade, but I realized I don't like how it looks on me. Right now I'm using an aerie crossbody bag that is cute and sporty, but I'd like something more girly and feminine 🥺

How do I pick a purse?! What are good brands to look at that aren't VERY expensive? Maybe in the $100-$250 ish range? I have no idea what I'm doing 💀

Edit: thank you so much for all the feedback!!!! I'm looking at everyone's recommendations ❤️🙏

To answer some questions:

1. The budget is CAD 
2. Colour - I think I'd ideally go for black because it's easily matched with most things! I don't like the patterns coach has on their purses, I think more plain leather is nice for me 
3. Size - I think the size of the ""Coach Maggie Small Tote"" seems nice! 9.75x7.5x4.5"". I carry my phone, a small pill case, a small wallet, mini brush, lip balm and gloss, sunglasses, and a reusable bag on my day to day 
4. Length/ where it should land - i think I'd like something like a tote with shorter handles - I can hold it in my elbow or in my hand since that's where I find I end up carrying my purse right now. I am 5'0 for reference!

1jkgbpo,handbags,Mid-Range Black Bag!!,"Howdy gang! I’ve been desperately searching for an every day, mid-range black bag and need help choosing amongst the contenders! 

Things that are important to me:

- real leather
- staying power of the style
- being able to style in multiple ways
- Bonus points for silver hardware (or minimal hardware if gold)

My current rotation is the Oroton Emilia Large tote in black, the Chloé Medium Faye in black/suede, and a CalPak Stevyn Fanny Pack in brown (which I’ve been relying on for every single casual outfit 😅). At some point I will also probably get the Coach Tabby 26 in Maple/Silver, so hoping this new bag fills the gap in my closet for a small, casual top handle / shoulder bag in black leather.

Ideally, I’d like to spend as little as it takes to invest in a piece of reasonable quality (definitely not looking to splurge here! This will be a daily workhorse and I’d rather not feel guilty when I inevitably put it through a lot). But that said, also willing to be convinced to spend a little more for a bag that will last me many seasons, in style and durability.

So, the options (in order of my current feelings, but these change like every day lol):

1. Quince Trapeze Crossbody ($99)
2. Furla Nuvola Mini ($238)
3. Songmont Luna Bag (Silver-tone) ($349)
4. Polène Béri ($490)
5. Polène Mokki Mini ($660)
6. Oroton Emilia Soft Mini Tote ($345)
7. Polène Numéro Neuf Mini ($540)

Honorable mentions go to the Songmont Drippy Roof and The Horse Clementine, whose styles I do like, but I think I will be happier with a more “tailored” look long term.

I feel that I’ve scoured everywhere for options, but if you do have any other recommendations, please let me know!! I’m also an avid thrifter / second-hand shopper, so also always open to those listings as well! TY!!

At first I was completely sold on the gummy colorway, but after looking at it for too long it felt boring to me (don’t get me wrong it’s still gorgeous, I think I just looked at it too long) I decided to get the malaga color. I usually carry solid black leather bags (I’m mostly a coach girlie) so I wanted something colorful. This bag is so gorgeous and the leather and suede are so soft. It doesn’t have feet on the bottom but stands up on its own just fine. It fits a ton—my wallet, keys, iPhone 14 Pro, small pouch with hand sanitizer, ibuprofen and other bits and bobs, AirPods, and lip balm. Even a 16.9oz water bottle fits in there too. it shipped quickly and arrived from Turkey to NJ in 5 days. It was wrapped in the box beautifully and came with a cream colored dust bag (they used to be green, same shade as a the box). overall I’m very pleased with this purchase, first time spending $$$$$ on a bag which is also why I put off buying it for so long but it did not disappoint.

1jiqn25,handbags,Coach Laurel: My New Mom-ish Bag!,"I've been on the hunt for a nicer ""mom bag"" to use while my kid and I are out and about. She's 6, so I don't need to carry diapers or anything, but I still end up carrying a lot. Especially since we live in a big city and don't drive, so we're on the trains, buses, walking around, etc.

I basically wanted a big tote bag, but totes often slide off my shoulders, and I wanted the option to wear it as a crossbody (key for playing with my kid and waking long distances). After researching on this sub and the Coach sub I decided on the Laurel (large). 

I love it! As you can see from this pic it fits a ton-- this is basically what was in my bag by the end of the day: wallet, battery pack, mask pack, some random toothbrush heads I bought at the drugstore, my kid's water bottle, her sweater, hand towel, Shuppato eco bag (if you know, you know), kid sunglasses, adult sunglasses, a lipstick, and a million different snacks (both eaten and uneaten, ha). I could still shove even more in it if I needed to as well!

It's a little on the heavy side when packed like this, but I wanted a leather bag, not lighter fabric, so that's the price I pay I guess. I chose the dark stone color, which is a really sophisticated feeling neutral. I feel like it has just the right amount of slouch for me, without feeling sloppy.

1jigjac,handbags,Custom bag review,"I took advantage of a recent sale from u/raptureofsenses and got myself a variation on the Bottega Veneta hula hoop bag. It’s a little bigger and the body is woven while the straps are not, an inversion of the BV bag.

I’ve spent the last year and a half window shopping and trying on Celine, YSL, and Bottega Veneta bags. The leather and lining of this bag is better than the Celine and YSL and on par with BV. The leather feels very luxe and soft, and the lining is a beautiful soft suede and it feels really luxurious every time I open it. It even smells amazing.

I was going to treat myself to a Celine bag in a few months and honestly I think I’m going to order another bag from her instead, the quality is incredible and you pay for the craftsmanship rather than the brand name.

Communication, payment, and shipping was also really easy.

Highly recommend!

I like that they have similar shapes, but something about the Lana just really scratches a nice itch in my brain. I'm also trying to figure out if I actually like the Brooklyn or if it's just the hype from social media that made me even consider it. Once I make my decision, I plan to use it for both work and as like a ""city bag"" (so like when I go out on the town for a full day and need to bring a decent amount of stuff, if that makes any sense).

So all of this being said, what are your thoughts on both of these bags? Should I settle for the Brooklyn since it costs less, or should I wait for the Lana? Do you think functionality-wise they're interchangeable? ",2025-03-22 19:06:11+00:00,3,5

1jh8owk,handbags,Bag recs for work,"Hello brains trust! I was hoping to get some recommendations that fit the following criteria. I'm more interested in quality and design than brand name. 
- Budget - about 500USD (but willing to shop second hand, so it’s ok if the RRP is higher) 
- Material - Leather
- Style - shoulder bag
- Size: Must fit 14 inch laptop + lunchbox (so needs a bit of width). I am petite though so the smallest possible bag that meets this criteria would be ideal. 
- Additional Requirements: Must fully close (zip or flap), studs on the bottom to prevent wear (I will be using this bag everyday), classic look suitable for professional environment. I like gold hardware. Thicker straps so that the weight doesn’t dig into your shoulders would be a plus but not essential! 

- Inspo: I like the look of both the Mulberry Bayswater and Celine 16 Soft bags, but both are out of my price range. Any Coach or Furla styles that fit the bill would be great.

1jh2v7b,handbags,"Need suggestion for tall, sturdy bag","I need some bag suggestions for a tote that is a real everyday bag.  Everyday as in ‘ if I leave the house, it will be with me.’  I have crappy organs that need replacement, but until my number on the transplant lists get pulled, I’m on 24/7 O2. When I go outside my house, I have to change from my big condenser to a mobile one. The only bags offered by the company my insurance picked are cheaply made fabrics, all black, crossbody with cheap plastic hardware and a 3 inch wide strap. It is also not the correct size (around 8 inches too long). My mobile set up is a small O2 tank with a regulator on top, adding up to 14i inches tall. I hate carrying this damned thing everywhere, especially in a bag that was possibly purchased at the Dollar Tree, plus my normal bag. 

I am looking for a sturdy, well made bag that isn’t trendy but one that will always be stylish. I’d prefer $500 or less (frankly, I’m not going to be here for the lifetime of a super luxury bag), is leather or a similarly tough fabric, and roomy enough to serve as  O2 storage and a purse. I really don’t want two bags. Everywhere I browse have totes, but most are 10”-12” high, or are considered luggage. I don’t care if my tank has to lean a little, but not enough to crimp the hose closed. Even my beloved PLG ( the land of a thousand totes) is falling short, literally.  

Apparently just being a 10lbs inconvenience isn’t enough, it also needs to be a size that is too big for a lot of bags, but too small for the comically large bags that make the wearer look like a toddler holding Grandma’s big ol bag, or change purse.  I’d also prefer no giant names/logos ( a là Michael Kors or Steve Madden). I’m open to any color, but not a lot of do-daddery on it. No extra straps that serve no purpose, grommets, rivets, tassels, little chains, or a purse for my purse (I don’t get the charm thing at all, I’m old and jumped off the fashion train many stops ago). I’m not opposed to pre-loved as long as it is in good shape and not wildly overpriced. Maybe even a backpack or sling bag as long as they are obviously not something for a child. I’ve been considering a La Pilage or Coach Willow, but neither of them catch my eye. 

So please, suggest away. With all the passion for bags here, as well as the sense of community, I’m 100% sure I’ll find one. Or, most likely 50 that I love. 

Thanks in advance and sorry for my wildly overly-verbose post. ",2025-03-22 07:10:41+00:00,4,10

Requirements: must at least fit a phone, slim cardholder, makeup compact, lippie, and sunglasses, and ideally AirPods

Currently I have a few small bags that I can wear out at night that are nicer (a red coach shoulder bag and small black pillow tabby), but don’t use either of these during the day much since they fall off my shoulder/don’t fit My sunnies and AirPods. I also have been using a lululemon belt bag during the day but want something a bit more elevated.

style: as kind of basic with an edge, I wear a lot of blacks and whites and some neutrals, and love a different bag that not everybody has to pop against an outfit . I love an artsy statement piece like a hand painted pair of pants or embroidered t shirt 



Currently considering:
Min and Mon amantis: $250, could dress up at night with my all black outfits and add a black strap to make it a shoulder bag 

Indigolush mini hobo bag: $350, can convert to crossbody, considering either smooth or crocodile embossed

LV papillon in either 30 or 26: ~500 on Japanese eBay, con that I’ve never bought an LV  before and def don’t wanna get scammed! I love the shape of this bag but def less edgy, however would like a more spring/summer bag so it’s on the table :)

1jgajt4,handbags,Conflicted - Fleming Soft Suede Hobo Bag,"Here is my dilemma.

I work in corporate, so I often lean towards sizes that would at least fit my laptop. I currently use the Coach Day Tote, which fits my everyday requirements. Now, I saw this Tory bag which I thought was beautiful; however, I am not sure what size I should go for.

I feel like the intended slouch of the bag looks better suited to the smaller size. But if I get the larger size, I will get more use out of it and if I am getting something, I want to use it often.

If I do get the smaller size, I can still use it, but I would have to carry my laptop in a handy tote (btw I work in consulting, so it is pretty on the go and I need my laptop on me at all times) which I am okay with, but it might get kinda cumbersome overtime.

So please let me know what you would suggest as per your experience. Also, help me out on how to care for suede.

So a couple months ago I bought a previously owned large YSL SDJ bag. Classic black, studded strap, in near perfect condition. But I’m kinda having second thoughts about it. The bag is beautiful and it’s a classic bag but I just don’t know.
It might sound crazy but I’m thinking of reselling it and purchasing the Coach Rogue 39. I’ve been thinking about that bag for a WHILE but I would prefer to customize with charms and chains, all the fun stuff to make it personalized.
Both bags are my style and about the same size. The YSL would be a great work bag and forever chic but I think the Coach is a more everyday style, but I’m also thinking I might be influenced by the trend over something timeless?
Or do I do both? That’s always an option lol

1jdd3mf,handbags,Work + weekend bag in one?,"Hello, I'm looking for recommendations for a shoulder bag that can function as both a work bag and weekend bag. I have a convertible backpack that can hold everything I need no matter where I go, but I'm looking for something dressier and cuter. While I do have bags that work very nicely for work or weekend (but not both), I've recently been finding it a little cumbersome to move my things from bag to bag depending on the day (in other words, I'm lazy). I'm looking for a good quality and durable shoulder bag that's spacious, not too heavy, and has various compartments/pockets. I'm open to using pouches or an insert to organize the contents if there are no/limited compartments/pockets. Some things I would like to have but don't absolutely need are some type of closure at the top, feet, gold hardware over silver.

For work, I need to hold a 14"" laptop, water bottle, small wallet, and makeup pouch. For weekend (or errands), I need to hold various kid items (water bottles, snacks, little toys, sweaters) plus my own small wallet and makeup bag.

My budget is up to $700, preferably closer to $500 or less, but I would consider spending up to $700 for a very good quality bag that checks all the boxes. Two bags I'm considering are Kate Spade's large deco shoulder bag and Coach's Brooklyn 39 bag (see links below), but I would love to hear other ideas (or feedback about these two bags).

I hadn't even considered the Coach Lana when poking around online. In photos it looked bulky and yet also as though my laptop might not fit. I only looked more closely once the SA pointed it out as an option.

It's actually kind of perfect! Extremely roomy (I swear Coach bags have some TARDIS magic so they're bigger on the inside--my Cassie 19 is the same way), yet it looks more like a large purse than a briefcase. I already adore it! I already had the pear charm and I think it looks fabulous here.

1jcy0yx,handbags,Bag suggestion for Mum,"Hello everyone! First time posting but I've been lurking for a while and loving everybody's beautiful collections.

I wanted to get some suggestions about a possible designer bag I can purchase for my mum from my first salary. I'm south east asian and it's a lovely tradition to buy items for your parents from your first paycheck. Years ago I promised myself I'd get my mum a bag that she'd never choose to get herself since she'd rather spend that money on her family - so here I am now : )

My budget is around 4.5K AUD, though I can extend a little if needed. Ideally will try limit it though because the more expensive the bag, the more difficulty I'll have getting mum to accept it. I'm in Melbourne, Australia and would prefer to buy locally. While I do love supporting more indie or niche houses, for this bag I'm looking at the big designers to fulfill my promise.

Requirements are: 
- Designer house, can be purchased in Australia
- In 4.5K AUD range (potentially a little more if neccesary)
- Top handle, structured handbag
- Balanced size wise for a petite person
- Neutral shade to be used with multiple outfits
- Leather 
- Optional, but some sort of closure/zip for security 

Currently considering these beige nano sac de jour's from YSL - would love to hear some experiences with these as well. I'm also happy to answer any additional questions like the bags and colours she already has from brands like coach etc.

I need an everyday bag that can fit basic essentials (phone, small wallet, small makeup pouch) plus occasionally one of my kids’ water bottles or a change of clothes, etc. Would love any input on these options!

1. Love the way this one looks and the color. Not sure about the strap and kind of think it looks messy being adjustable. 
2. Like the shape and lack of branding. Worried the color is too light and will get messy since the leather is smooth. Also wondering if it will be hard to get into with the shape. 
3. Probably the front runner that I keep coming back to. Wish the color was slightly less orange but otherwise seems great. 
4. I just really love this bag and think it’s so cute. I’m not crazy about the color (I really love the brown suede version but I don’t want to be limited to when I can use it). It’s probably not as practical and I can’t really figure out the true size so may not be big enough for me. Talk me out of it😂
5. Feel like this is similar style but not as cute as the longchamp but if it’s way better I could be convinced. 
6. Love the color. Not crazy about the logo on the front even though it’s small. Again feel like it may be hard to get into. ",2025-03-16 17:14:05+00:00,12,15
1jcp4le,handbags,Trying to remember a studded crossbody popular in the mid 2010's (2012-2017),"Going by memory: It was a crossbody, hard leather, and studded trim. Sometimes black studs, but also silver. Leather was often black, but available in other bright colours as well (if memory serves). Cant remember if it came in different sizes, but the one I remember was a medium....not a tote, but also not a clutch.

Lots of the rock/alternative bloggers of the time would have the bag, or bags from the line. In Canada, you could find the bag at The Bay and Nordstorm for $200-$300.

NOT Coach, Ted Baker, Tory Birch, Kate Spade, or All Saints (100% fits All Saints vibe though). Feel like the name of the brand/line started with an 'A' (was a name), but also feel like it may have started with an 'M' as well?

Any leads would be awesome. 💗

But I've been looking for the *perfect* red bag for like a year now, and I finally found THE ONE and it was only $80! It's a patent leather Pratesi that's definitely a made-for-outlets version of their Barchetta bag. But I honestly wouldn't want to pay more for a patent leather bag because of the inevitable scuffs and scratches. This one is real leather at least, and I found a patent leather conditioner by Saphir I'm going to order asap to try to keep it in good shape, but I know it's not going to be pristine forever no matter what I do. 

I took my mom purse shopping at Marshall's the very next day and I found this super fun cherry print straw bag by Betsey Johnson for $25! As you can probably guess from the picture, cherries are pretty much my ""thing"" and I will happily rock this little cutie all summer. 

And finally, the Coach Teri bag in chalk white cherry print. I have been eyeing this bag, the Florence sandal, and the diamond silk scarf in this cherry print since the day they came out. 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍

My husband and I were shopping for his brother's birthday present when I made a joke about needing him to keep me out of the Coach Outlet as we were passing it, so then of course we immediately went inside. 🤣 

I obsessively showed him every single accessory with the cherry print until we finally made it to the back where they had like 4 bags with the print in chalk. They're 60% off now so I snagged the Teri bag for $160! 

I had been behaving myself for MONTHS trying to convince myself I didn't need it. But when I finally held it in my hands I knew I'd kick myself forever if I didn't grab it, especially at that price. 

Yesterday I looked online one more time at the diamond silk scarf and there was exactly ONE left on Amazon and every other site I looked at was already sold out. So yup, I grabbed the scarf too! 🤣

the Puzzle is my daily driver, as you can tell with all the charms lol. next on my list is to add a white and a yellow bag. ideally, i’ll eventually add orange, purple and pink bags as well, but those aren’t as high on my list of priorities. i want my luxury collection to be a mix of classic/timeless pieces, as well as some bolder, trendier pieces since that fits my wardrobe well as a gay late 20-something. i also wanted a variety in terms of textures (shearling, jacquard, suede, large hardware) and patterns (the zucca print). i have two crossbodies, one hobo, three flaps and a structured tote, so i’m looking to add more unique silhouettes.

i only want one bag from each brand until i have fleshed out my bases, and the next brands i’ve been looking at are Prada (i really enjoy their bags in the triangle shapes), Ferragamo (specifically the Hug bag), and something from one of the gaudier brands (Balmain’s new stuff looks really cool) but i’m a huge stickler for quality. i was really impressed by the quality of all these bags after being used to Coach’s more expensive bags for a long time, but brands like Balenciaga and Versace’s handbag quality really disappointed me when i handled them in person. to my surprise, the Burberry is absolutely the best quality bag of all of these pictured; they might be having an identity crisis right now, but the build quality is absolutely amazing. only the Sac De Jour comes close.

1jayyj4,handbags,Vintage Gucci Diana tote: should I get it?,"Hey everyone, I'm not sure if I want to be enabled or deinfluenced....

Lately I've been obsessed with the idea of getting a light brown vintage Gucci Diana tote.

I found a couple in very good condition for about 600-650$.

I love how the bag looks, it is quite spacious and the price is pretty good for the condition.

But... should I really get it?

For context, I am a mom to a 7 month old so I don't go out that much without the baby so I usually end up carrying one of the following combinations:

* a backpack and a small crossbody bag (a tiny vintage black Longchamp)
* put the diaper bag on the stroller and wear either the same small crossbody or a slightly bigger bag, more specifically a black Coach Willow shoulder bag but with the crossbody strap.

  
When I do go out by myself I usually carry the Coach Willow shoulder bag either as a shoulder bag or crossbody, depending on the mood.

The crossbody function of both of those is super useful because it frees up my hands when I'm with the baby so this is the first doubt I am having; that the tote is ""only"" a handbag. This then leads to the question if I should really spend that money on a bag I will not use that much (immediately, at least) but then... Who knows if I will find what I want when I am actually ""ready"".

On one hand, I definitely don't need the bag but on the other hand, there is a little devil on my shoulder telling me to treat myself 😭

1jag8bi,handbags,Best bag for travel across Europe?,"Hi all!

I’m traveling to Europe for my wedding and honeymoon, and I am trying to decide which bag to get for everyday use during my trip. Right now I have some high end/luxury very small bags that are great for a night out but not practical for travel use. All my other bags are not all that exciting.

We are going to be in a few major cities including Paris and London, so something that’s a bit harder to pickpocket or grab off me is ideal (learned the hard way when my phone was stolen from a flap bag in Barcelona once). We will be going to some high end restaurants as well as doing some private guided tours.

I’m open to interesting designs and fun colors! I was looking at Furla, Andres Gallardo (maybe), Strathberry, Coach, Mulberry, etc. Ideally looking to spend about $1000 USD or less.

1j9u4dk,handbags,"So…what do you guys think? I like her, but not infatuated.","This is one of the red Swing Zips that were 60% off at Macys. We all know getting 60% off on retail Coach, especially when all the other colors of this style are still $399, is RARE.

Pros:

Love the Ruby shade of red. Not too blue-red; not too orange-red. True red IMHO.

I’m inclined to believe she’s a floor model or maybe a return. The only real wear I see is tiny scratches on the feet. Also the glovetanned leather is softer than a brand new factory wrapped, never opened bag, which is a pro for me. It takes a good month of wearing to soften this leather.

I knew she was small, and in the last two years or so, I prefer small bags. She feels good against my body. Close to a perfect Goldilocks size for me.

She’s leather lined! 

Again, 60% off!!!


Cons:

This is pretty stupid, but it sort of bothers me she was thrown into a Macys plastic bag instead of a box. The purse was in a a sloppy plastic bag, although she had stuffing and was in excellent condition. Oh yeah, UPS forgot to deliver her to Denver and she was flown to Portland, Oregon and had to be flown back so she was 7 days late. 

She’s floppier than my favorite Coach bags (Rogue Top Handle, Bandit, and Sammy off the top of my head). She does stand up when full.

Maybe I don’t prefer zipper closures anymore? 

I like the narrow straps, but one tend to slide off my shoulder.

I really like changing out straps and she’s kind of dedicated to these straps.

So…I thought I’d get your input. Plus it’s fun to share pics and comments.

Sorry my red car is dirty! Just washed her two days ago. Then again I live in Colorado…

1j95h3z,handbags,Oldie: my first premium 👜: Ferragamo Sophia,"This bag has fallen out of rotation as it is larger than I need most of the time. But it is a fave! 

This was my first premium bag, and how I became a Ferragamo fan! This bag fits a ton without being huge. 

I took it out today because I am headed to a networking meeting and wanted space for a cardigan. 😂

The details are what stood out for me with this bag and still do today. The branding is minimal - mostly the trademark horseshoe hardware in a couple places. The flap also has a zipper for security.  

When I got this bag I was always drawn to structured bags. But my workplace was casual at the time. I wanted a big work bag (no need to bring a laptop when I got this one), a crossbody strap, and something that felt polished. I went back and forth on the pebbled or smooth leather.  I went for pebbled, which made this bag feel less formal and not too much at the office where the CTO wore a purple dinosaur onesie a few days a week. 

This bag served me well as a daily bag for 3 years. And occasional use since. And honestly it barely even looks worn at all. It has gone on trips. To the ballet (I happened to find an old ticket in the pocket today), and everywhere in between.  

I got the last generation with the leather lining which was a must for me. And some more details changed after. 

But I love this practical, classic lady like bag that still works for more casual lifestyles. This one I’ll keep forever. A mini would serve me well at this point. 

I had a charm on this bag pretty much the whole time, but landed on this Coach feather as a perfect touch.  ",2025-03-11 23:51:45+00:00,165,9

I loved the shape of the Polene Umi, but it is sadly discontinued and I don’t believe it came in a deep brown, but I’ve been chasing a similar vibe for a while. I’d also love a matching medium wallet if the brand makes something similar. I know coach has a ton.

Coach (Outlet) - Teri Hobo Bag
Haven’t seen this one in person yet but I love the shape, size, and color! Hate the silver hardware and the clips for the handle look cheap. It is on the affordable side due to being Coach outlet, but I’d love something that looks more elevated, I think the silver and the clips for the handle look cheap, but I love that it can be a crossbody/long strap or the shoulder strap!

Coach Brooklyn Shoulder bag 23-
Love this bag! The hardware is brass, which I’d prefer gold, but I think it looks great. The shape is fantastic, it could be a little bigger (not a fan of the 28 size), but there’s no zipper!!

Cuyana Celestia Shoulder Bag- super cute shape, color, and size, and love the buckle to adjust the strap! Worried about the smooth leather and I’m not very familiar with the brand, not sure how it would hold up long term. Would appreciate the option to make it crossbody if needed, but not 100% necessary.

After looking at vintage Prada, Gucci, etc. online, I decided I needed to try on different styles in person and stopped by Nordstrom and happened to see the Brooklyn. I actually think the leather is great. It’s unlined, which keeps it light weight, but is still supple and soft and yet firm enough to keep its structure. I assume as I use it, it’ll soften up even more with time. I don’t mind a floppy bag 😍

It fills a ton, including sunglasses, water bottle, several mini pouches filled with misc such as cosmetics, first aid, card holders, etc. for organization.

I also love the d rings for personalization. I added my vintage LV x TM cle in black mc to dress her up 🌈

I’m 5’6 and I find the size a little oversized but honestly perfect for my frame. I had my sights on the 28 but it was unfortunately too small.

I like the minimal logo and design, and subtle branding. However, I don’t like the genuine leather stamp on the bottom… good thing it’s not as noticeable on the larger Brooklyn.

Coach brooklyn - love this bag! it’s not available in my country though 🫨 probably the only thing is that there’s no zipper and it gets slouchy over time, but i figured an insert works 

LV carryall - love the silhouette, way out of budget

1iv4f5r,handbags,Wardrobe advice needed,"
I’m going to a nice lunch with my best friend and then on for cocktails with her and a group of friends afterwards, in London next week. 

I’m planning on wearing this dress, with the silver belt trim, Louboutin flats  (I just cannot wear heels these days) and a black velvet biker jacket with silver tone zips. 

I’m in a bag quandary, and this is where you lot come in.  I need to bring quite a little of stuff so need a bigger bag. I’d love to bring my new black Coach Empire as she hasn’t had an outing yet, but feels like the brass hardware will be weird with all the silver trim on the outfit?? I could do my Lime Brooklyn as the brass is minimal and will bring a pop of colour? Or I have a yellow Coach Elise from a few years ago that has silver hardware?? 

Or do I go for a small bag and a carryall. I could do a black Gucci Dionysus and a black Le Pliage ?

1it8jp2,handbags,Coach 28 welp - a cult? I’m just a mom!,"Hello, for my 33rd bday my friends want to give me a handbag! Now I'm chin deep into this handbag-rabbit hole and I found Brooklyn 28 on Zalando. It was love at first sight but I must say, the hype is a bit daunting to me!

Maybe you guys can help me out.

Is it true it isn't super durable..? And the lining comes off or something? Really wondering about this firstly. 

Then, will it fit a water bottle? I think the 39 is too big so I'm hoping it does. 

Then, a friend told me it will be like the longchamp handbags that now every 14 y/o wears. And that it will steal away from it's allure. Others who feel similar?? Like, what teenager can afford 350 dollar bags?? (i know, rich ones, but how plenty are those really). 

Anyway, it also needs to be a bit of a 'mom bag'. So just a bag for everyday use that will fit many styles. And an emergency diaper.

Maybe this is a bit too long of a post, but moms, teenagers and everything in between, please share with me your handbag wisdom, 'cause I ain't got none (yet)! 

Much appreciated 😻

Update after only a couple of hours:

Omg thank you all for the thorough replies!! I do see now that I will definitely not just order it online but take a look in a store first. And then see if it meets my wants and needs. I definitely also always have a diaper backpack so this one would be for extra haha.

As for the 'teenagers wearing it too' thing, I don't think I actually care, but I was curious to see if that's a thing! 350 for me is definitely a lot of money, so hence my curiosity! I shall tell my friend to start wearing her longchamp bag again, and stop caring about the cool gen-alphas 😌

Got my bonus at work this year, and I get to keep more of it than expected (thought we’d owe on our taxes this year but we don’t!). I want to branch out from Coach though which is what I usually buy.  

Right now, my Brooklyn 39 is my main bag, and then when I switch I just take things from there to put in my smaller bags if I want one for the day, then put everything back to go back to the Brooklyn. The other two in the main rotation are a Rogue 25 and an older Coach Hadley Duffle.  

I use pouches or an organizer in my open bags, but I think I’d like something that has more pockets/organization. I like leather, and it can’t be something I’d have to baby because I have a toddler. I’ve been eyeing The Sak thanks to social media algorithms which is nice because of the price and it seems like people in this sub think they’re good quality, but I’d go up to  $500 budget-wise.

1in441x,handbags,Coach Brooklyn 28 or Opelle Baby Ballet,"I ordered a Coach Willow Soft 19 in dark stone as an early birthday gift to myself as I wanted a softer bag compared to my more structured bags that I could wear both around town or on vacation. I thought it would be a good fit because I don’t carry too much in my bags typically or when traveling. I love how it feels and I love the color and size, but I’m not sure I love the bucket style. Most of my bags are either top handle or crossbody or both. I may be returning it which really makes me sad. 

I’ve been thinking of possibly getting in its place either a Coach Brooklyn 28 or an Opelle Baby Ballet. I’m in between these two because they seem not too big or small for my needs and they both look very soft and smooth feeling. I was leaning towards the Baby Ballet because it does have the option to crossbody or top handle and that seems like a better fit. It also has the zippered top closure while the Brooklyn is just a magnetic closure. Not a deal breaker at all though. And the Brooklyn 28 is only shoulder wear capable. The problem here is that the Baby Ballet seems to not be available at this time to order (doesn’t say limited edition, just not available currently) and it’s not like I can check it out in store since I’m in the U.S.  

What are your thoughts on all three bags? Am I crazy to consider returning the Willow? Does anyone know if the Baby Ballet in Cuero is being restocked soon? Or is the Brooklyn Bag just as good?

Since this sub was where I first found out about the Acquired podcast and their episodes on LVMH and Hermes, I thought maybe others would be interested, too.

First, guess which Coach products were so successful that they got a shout out during the call 😊

Ok, ready? Coach sales were up by 10% this quarter. The number one bag was... the Tabby, specifically the 26. The New York line, in particular the Brooklyn 28, was also a huge driver of sales. (That did surprise me, I would have guessed the 39.) And their #4 product overall? The cherry charm. 

Other notes of interest: while Coach is up 10%, Kate Spade sales are down 10%.

No surprises for any regular reader of the sub, but it was so interesting to see how accurately the vibes in the sub match actual sales!

2. The Coach bag is marginally smaller than the KS, and I do appreciate more space in my bags. 

3. The drop length of Coach is 21.5 while KS is 20.5

1iaqy5y,handbags,It’s like a reward.. help me pick!,"My last cancer treatment is coming up in a week, and to celebrate 18mo of chemo, losing my boobs, and just all around surviving, I’m treating myself to a handbag. 

Up until like a month ago, I was SET on it being the Pochette Métis in black. I’ve wanted this bag for years and talked myself out of it over and over again. Tried it on in person in store and adore it.

But then.. I put second thoughts in my head. Is that the one I want?? The City bag was a lust of mine 20 years ago, and now that I have adult money, I could make the 23 year old me very happy. And I’m always in love with the Alexa… she will happen at some point. The Diane is super cute, and in that grey color 🥰 

Current owns: Neverfull MM monogram canvas, Speedy B25 in DE, a Mosaic in bottle green, a Bayswater in chalk, a Tabby 26 oxblood, and a Brooklyn 39 in brown suede. Something black would round out my collection quite nicely. I like a medium size bag, and even better when I can wear it crossbody. 

Thoughts, comments, suggestions?? I’m 95 percent certain it’ll be the LV PM… but open to a sale of something else to celebrate my big win!!",2025-01-26 21:26:56+00:00,367,257

Has anyone else with the Coach Brooklyn bag in Cedar Suede experienced quick signs of wear? I know suede can be challenging to maintain, but I'm surprised how quickly the corners have shown signs of wear considering I've only had it a few weeks and have been pretty gentle to it.

I did some research and loved the look of the Coach Brooklyn Shoulder Bag 28 in Dark Ruby. I also just came across the Mansur Gavriel Candy Hobo in Pomegranate and see that it's on a huge sale and looks similar! The Candy Hobo is normally $1045 CAD + tax but ends up being even cheaper than the Coach bag due to the sale.

Does anyone have either of these and can vouch for their quality and overall feelings on the bags?? I saw some comments in this forum that Mansur Gavriel isn't great quality but that price seems almost too good to pass up!

  
Thanks :)

It's gonna be a while until I get a disposable income, and I can't always rely on gifts from family!

I know they're usually pretty high-quality and use good materials, so I'd like to find cleaning and maintenance tips for both. I've found a blog about Coach products, but I'd appreciate some advice from real users, too - products you recommend for the leather or treatments for the canvas to keep them looking new, things like that.

1i6jx9r,handbags,Weird jabby comments about my bag,"So the other day I was visiting my Step-mother-in-law (SMIL), and like me she loves bags and accessories, she loves her Fossil and Patricia Nash bags and various other outlet bags- so her weird attitude kinda came out of nowhere!   
So I was wearing my new Coach silver tabby shoulder bag which I got on sale, and normally she's very enthusiastic about my bags but this time my SMIL *made a face at it* and then said she was ""looking at those bags but they just weren't for me,"" in a weird dismissive tone and then started bragging about the bag haul she got at Bealls, saying she snagged up five or six different Betsey Johnson and Juicy Couture bags and she proceeded to show off two of them to me, again with this like.... I guess uppity tone, not sure how to describe it, like she was implying that her purchases were better because she got more bags for less than I paid for my Coach bag.  I could be reading too much into it but that's really how it came off, and she's never really done that before so I was like ???? the whole time. I've always been enthusiastic and supportive about her bags and other purchases, even if it's not stuff I personally like, so it just felt so odd!  I mean it's not like she's never bought a mid range bag before, she has a few in her collection! So I'm sitting here like damn what was THAT about? 

I know a lot of y'all have faced snarky, dismissive, or straight up mean comments about your bags, and like if I'd heard that from a stranger I'd have just rolled my eyes and moved on but that it came from my SMIL just seemed so out of character for her. ",2025-01-21 14:35:33+00:00,103,111

1i3vzh1,handbags,Disappointing order from Virsa Bags,"Sharing my experience with this seller, whom I discovered through this subreddit, in the hopes of helping others make more informed purchasing decisions. Usually I greatly prefer supporting small businesses, the quality and CS are usually better than big brand names, but unfortunately that was not my experience with Virsa Bags.

Buying the bag was super easy; the seller was very quick to reply and friendly. The bag was shipped five days after placing my order which is a very quick turn around time for a handmade bag. Packaging was standard, though the cardboard box it was shipped in was quite thin. Upon receipt, I immediately noticed the[ turnlock hardware had chips and scratches](https://imgur.com/B5uA5E9) even in areas where the turnlock doesn't reach. I contacted the seller to return the bag and they said they could send a replacement turnlock because it would be easy to replace. That sounded reasonable, so I wait a month with nothing arriving before contacting them again to ask if there was a tracking number. They said I would get a tracking number the following week. At this time, I was days from moving and didn't have a new address yet. My window to dispute on Paypal had also passed. I filed a claim on Etsy to return the bag but support told me if I wanted a refund I would have to contact my financial institution and closed my case. [Receipts of messages with the seller.](https://imgur.com/a/virsa-bags-messages-hEzOUpF)

After this, I start combing through the shop's reviews (which I should've done before ordering). Sure enough, there are others who had [similar quality issues](https://imgur.com/pv6MAfy), [replacements which never came](https://imgur.com/0ievdlA), and difficulty in trying to get a refund.. [This reviewer with white marks](https://imgur.com/XgGBTCq) on their bag caught my eye. Upon closer examination, my bag also had[ white marks along the stiches](https://imgur.com/pimxLTZ) all over the bag. There are definitely some quality control issues. My advice to anyone who has issues with a bag purchased from this seller: file a claim with Etsy immediately and don't agree to anything other than returning the item for a refund. I wasted a month waiting for a replacement part that never came, letting all the return windows close, and regret it. \[Edit: If all else fails, do a chargeback. My Etsy account hasn't been suspended (yet), but that's a possibility I can live with. It wasn't required to return the bag so the leather will be upcycled to something else.\]

Anyways, onto reviewing the bag itself. I'll be comparing it to the Coach quilted Tabby. [Comparison photos](https://imgur.com/a/virsa-bags-vs-coach-quilted-tabby-znEk9bg) (Coach is black, Virsa is green). The hardware of the Virsa bag is gold painted, so chipping with use is to be expected (if not already chipped upon arrival). The chain of the bag does not adjust as smoothly as the Tabby, there's slight resistance. I chose the smooth leather option and the leather is smooth, but not buttery and soft like the Tabby. It's quilted but there's not much padding. Apart from the white marks along the stitching, I also noticed the thread does stick out on scattered threadholes. [Here's a picture](https://imgur.com/LgjwrtT) showing what I mean. It does feel prickly when you skim your fingers over it which is annoying. [The parts where the leather was glued ](https://imgur.com/KkzkxUd)are also visible. The interior is lined with fabric. There are two main compartments, one front pocket and one zippered pocket. YMMV depending on the type of bag and leather you choose.

TL;DR Customer service was great until I had an actual problem. The bag is cheap but you get what you pay for.

\[Edited in response to [the shop's reply](https://imgur.com/a/cIfyHak)\]

**Reviews are for buyers, not sellers.** My review and rating reflect my opinion of both the bag I received and my experience buying from the shop and I stand by it. People can read my review and decide for themselves whether or not they want to purchase. Not surprised that the shop chose to reply and discount my experience as it matches my previous dealings with them. Etsy has a tendency to hide negative reviews, my review isn't even visible unless you sort by lowest rating.

The entirety of our message history, after contacting the shop with my issue, is in the receipts. If they sent any other messages I never received it.

Coach tabby is priced $395, in total I purchased it for \~$200 (aafes has great sales). The Virsa bag I purchased is priced at $128.07, the total including discount and shipping was \~$150. Coach is a very accessible brand and many users will be familiar with the Tabby, hence why I used it as a comparison.

I love the size because it fits so much and the strap length is perfect and wears comfortably on the shoulder. Well I wanted to buy another Scotty in another color but I just found out it's been discontinued!! 😭😭😭

If anyone has any recommendations for a small (but not mini) leather shoulder bag that's good for daily wear, I would love you forever! Don't really have a budget and I'm willing to pay for a bag that I love!

A friend had recommended the Brooklyn 28 but it's a bit bigger than I'm looking for and I prefer a zipper closure but neither of those are deal breakers. I figured I'd ask the experts if there's something closer to a Scotty than the Brooklyn before I settle for it. I use my Prada Arque often and I love her but she can feel a bit cramped sometimes.

I'll take any help I can get! Thanks!!

1hv32a7,handbags,Bag Recommendations,"Hey everyone,

I’m in the market for a small leather bag that I can use regularly. 

Ideally, it would be “convertible” to a crossbody but also looks nice without the longer strap. 

I’ve included examples of two bags that I already own that I feel fit this description; the Micro Hamilton Satchet from Angela Roi (which I’m absolutely adore, it’s virtually perfect, but slightly too small) and the Mini Shopper Tote from Article & Goods. 

I’ve found many different similar options online—like the Freya shoulder bag and the Clementine bag from the Horse. Plus Coach tabby bag (but above my price point)

I’m not trying to break the bank so price range I would like to keep around $300. Prefer a neutral color, not necessarily black, and gold hardware (but not a dealbreaker).

1huydwq,handbags,Another bag with pockets like the Tabby?,"So I was hoping to buy the Quilted Tabby this year as my big purchase. But just today I have seen several tiktoks bringing to light the poor leather quality of the Quilted Tabby, in terms of the leather paint on the bottom panel peeling off. 

The Tabby is $1000 in my currency. I cannot spending that amount on a bag that will peel after 3 uses!

The main reason I love the Tabby is the number of pockets it has and how squishy/pillowy yet luxurious it looks… is there any other bag that’s similar, or with the same kind of compartments that the Tabby has?",2025-01-06 12:57:13+00:00,2,3

I need something to wear when I’m “look at me I’m cute” but I also need to carry wipes, change of toddler clothes, my stuff, plus my husband’s phone, car keys, and my kindle. It needs to be lightweight and easy to carry. I prefer top handles with a slouch but still structured and long strap. 

Ideally I’d stay under $1000 and be brand new. I honestly really like the Speedy Bandolier in Damier Ebene but I just can’t do the spend.  I like the slouchy look of it once it starts to break down and honestly this vibe is what I’m looking for that I can’t seem to find in something else. 


Styles I like but I just can’t pull the trigger on: Coach Lana 23, Coach Rowan Large, Coach Mollie Tote 25, Coach Brooklyn, Swing Zip, Cuyana The Mini System Tote, Cuyana The Double Loop

For more photos please check u/raptureofsenses on reddit and [https://www.instagram.com/rivamouth2/](https://www.instagram.com/rivamouth2/) on instagram, who made this lovely bag for me! She took much better photos that are more color accurate and show the whole bag :) 

I found her through r/handbags after seeing some of the gorgeous purses she'd made for others here, particularly a burgundy Jackie inspired bag that is actually the same leather that this bag is made out of! I made an inquiry on Nov 4th, and received my bag today Dec 31st. That's already very fast and within her promised turnaround time, and especially impressive if you consider it's the holiday season! 

I have been drooling over the Western Tabby's posted here for so long, but never pulled the trigger since there wasn't a colorway that I loved and I tend to prefer gold hardware anyways. 

So in getting the chance to request my own version of the bag, I got to make it perfect for me! It's slouchier than the original in the way that I like (structured enough to have a shape, but slouchy enough that you can pack weirdly shaped things without obvious bulges), pockets on the side for airpods/hand sanitizer, slip pocket in the back for my phone, and a front pocket for easy access to keys. I personally prefer turnlocks over magnetic closures, so this bag will match others in my collection too! And of course, getting it in this lovely burgundy/maroon color with gold hardware. 

In terms of process - she is very thorough, asking for details that I hadn't even considered, and making sure that every part of the bag is to your liking. I hadn't been super clear on what kind of strap I wanted (or rather, I accidentally contradicted myself since I forgot what I had said previously), and she was so kind and accommodating and actually just went ahead and made both a shoulder strap and crossbody strap for me, which turned out to be perfect! 

Payment process and shipping was easy and transparent, and she will follow up on things with you! Responds promptly despite time difference issues, and is both kind and clear in her communication! Price wise, it was definitely comparable with the original Coach bag, and though I'm no expert on quality, I can see no flaws on close inspection, and it is sturdy, smooth, and professionally finished. From what I see on this sub from others, it looks as though her bags historically have held up very well too! Definitely worth much more than I paid for, which is why I'm not surprised (and am happy actually) that she posted on IG about raising her base prices in the new year. 

I would strongly recommend working with her, and am planning on asking for another purse after the new year (once I decide what I'm going to ask for haha). For anyone considering it, I would ESPECIALLY recommend looking into it if you're in the situation of wanting an existing bag design but with some changes to make it perfect for you. Please reach out to u/raptureofsenses , she will take good care of you! 

TL;DR: got a custom bag, it's perfect for me, process was smooth, no complaints or feedback whatsoever, recommend without reservations! ",2024-12-31 18:18:53+00:00,14,5

1hhcw4z,handbags,Handbag Wrapped 2024!,"2024 is coming to a close very soon! I always love the concept of Spotify wrapped, so I would love to do a handbag wrapped! I added some questions for y'all to answer, but you're welcome to add your own! I really want to hear how y'all did this year! 

1. What was your most used bag this year? 

2.  What was your least used bag? 

3. the purses you bought this year! which is your fav or do you have a top 2,3,4,5 etc? 

4. what purses did you decide to part ways with? 

5. what are your bag goals/ must haves for next year? and any handbag lessons learned this year! 



Here is mine:   
1. My Coach soft tabby in black/gold still reigns supreme. it only gets better with age! 

2.  my maroon Gucci clutch. I purchased her for my birthday, and its so pretty to me but there are not a lot of occasions I find myself needing a full on clutch! it does have a nice lengthy chain strap, but it's just so flashy I feel like it takes over my outfit. 

3. I am ranking these by most liked to least (I still love them all!) this year was a bit handbag buying year, so I will only do a top 5 lol. Ferragamo East West Tote (in green), Mulberry Jody Tote (in black), Coach Brooklyn 39 (in black), Coach Cargo Tabby (in black), and my Polene Numero Un Nano(in sage green)

4. I parted ways with a TON of different bags. I felt like I was really impulsive this year and the end of last year, some highlights of what I  ended up selling include: Coach Swing Zip in hunter green (wasn't quite my vibe), Coach Jelly Tabby in Black (the smell was killing me after awhile!), Coach Sammy Handle 21 in patent leather (the constant smudging drove me up a wall, also hard to get things in and out of it.), Tory Burch Fleming Barrel in Gold (didn't love the way it sat under my arm, and the shape made it a bit hard to fit what I wanted to carry.), and the Sezane Farrow Bucket Bag (the quality was totally there for the price, but the strap was too short on me.) 

  
5. I have squirreled away some money for that massive Kisslock bag I am PRAYING Coach with come out with in the spring, and I have also added to Ferragamo Hug Bag to my buy list for next year, I really love the way they look and how the bigger ones slouch. The handbag lessons I learned this year were to be wayyyy more careful; about what I let into my collection. Less is more sometimes, I kept buying handbags because I felt I needed to fill ""gaps"" in my collection, but I really just needed to narrow down my collection and keep what I really loved, and reached for. So 2025 for me will be a super mindful year! ",2024-12-18 21:54:50+00:00,14,26

Coach Rogue Top Handle
Woven hobo bag by the Scuola del Cuoio
(Not pictured are 3 gorgeous baggu bags lmao)

Funnily enough, the bag I own the longest (Coach Rogue) is a bag that has a lot of features I usually dislike: flap top instead of a zipper, it‘s very boxy and structured, a short shoulder strap which makes it an armpit bag and it‘s not very spacious. Yet, it‘s the most beautiful bag I’ve seen and I‘m so so happy that I bought it 😂

The Brooklyn is my latest and last purchase. I tried not to love it because of the lack of zipper/zip pocket and black interior; things I tend to avoid. I couldn‘t stop thinking about it though so I gave it a try and I do love it. The slouchy shape is chef‘s kiss.

I‘ve talked about my Scuola del Cuoio bag in another post, feel free to check it out in my post history! 10/10 would recommend

Always happy to share with this lovely community 🫶🏻

1hgiiwo,handbags,"New to handbags, went shopping/comparing this weekend!","Hello!  I'm at the age where I can afford a \*nicer\* bag and this subreddit has been so fun to explore!  

I've never really looked at them in person before.  I've realized I'm not so much into them for the labels/status (altho a little of that is fun) but more the quality and the experience. 

So, I went shopping on the Mag Mile yesterday.  I didn't buy anything, but I was super curious to touch actual bags and see what all the fuss was about. 

I started in Coach bc you guys love Coach, and I watched some Tanner Leatherstein vids too, and he seems to really like Coach.  I really loved what I saw and felt in there.  They felt quality, sturdy, soft leather, and (as a mom) practical (and I think the one I really love is the Times Square Tabby!)

I also looked at Strathberry, Gucci, Kate Spade, and a couple of others in Bloomie's.  I could tell the difference between Coach and Kate Spade - KS was adorable but did not feel quite as nice as the Coach bags.  

  
But, when I got to Gucci, I genuinely could not tell a difference in quality at all, particularly for the price point.   I liked the Strathberry design but did not feel it was markedly higher quality either. 

Is this right?  What am I missing?  I know a lot of what you're paying for is just about status.  But what are your guys' thoughts? I'm learning so much and it's so fun to explore!",2024-12-17 19:24:02+00:00,7,3
1hftxfe,handbags,Little treat for a big birthday ,"I have a big birthday with a zero coming up and I’d like to get myself a treat but could do with some inspiration. Although I do love bright colours, I’m leaning towards something black. I don’t really do neutrals. Evening use, so doesn’t need to hold much - phone, keys, lipstick etc. I usually dress head to toe in black, especially for evenings. My clothing vibe is kinda quirky glam - suede, velvet, patent etc. I could be wearing Doc Martins or I could be wearing Gucci platforms. 

For bags I love quilted/padded, chain details and I tend to prefer silver tone hardware. I’m not a huge fan of logo prints. To give you an idea, recent purchases have been a Coach Quilted Pillow Madison, the gold Coach Jelly Tabby (although it had to go back as it kept falling apart - a story for another day!) and the Louboutin Marie Jane embellished leather bucket bag. My most used bag that I go back to time and again is a black Coach Whiplash Mini Duffle, and I think that sums up my style nicely.  

Go to labels are Marc Jacobs and Coach, but I’m more than happy to try something new and spend a little more than usual for something with a bit of wow factor. Budget is up to about £1000. 

So, handbag hive mind…you lot know everything there is to know and I’d love your ideas!!  ",2024-12-16 21:21:49+00:00,2,14

1hdgg5d,handbags,the perfect ugly brown bag 💘,"https://preview.redd.it/5nba4tnoan6e1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b23411bec807325330208b192eb7548943adf5dc

My mother and sister have kindly listened to my spiel but now I must subject the masses to my horribly mundane saga: the search for the perfect ugly brown bag.

I'm nothing if not a paradoxical mix of practical and dramatic and my bag collection is no exception. I have a Mulberry Green Small Iris, Mulberry Oxblood Small Bayswater, Celine Navy Classic Box Bag (Philo era), and a Loewe Black Small Hammock. I bought all but the Small Iris preloved (not that it matters, but it makes \*me\* feel better). I tend to dress like if your grandma was a hot art museum curator (s/o to my local thrift store), so rich moody hues work all year round.

ANYWAY I hate brown bags. I owned several as a teen and just... yawn. So boring. And yet I felt like I \*needed\* one, just one to fill the true neutral gap in my small but mighty (imo) collection. My self imposed budget this time around was $600 max (I just bought the Loewe and I hate to feel wasteful—there’s a lot to unpack there) so weeks ago I posted looking for alternatives to the Coach Western Tabby and came up short——I ended up purchasing the Coach, twice. The first had a cosmetic hardware defect and by the time the second arrived I had seen the Turnlock Tabby and thought maybe that was the answer to my problem. Hideous but functional and nostalgic (I'm in my 30s) in a cathartic sort of way (I survived Y2K thanks to my mom not allowing me to pluck my eyebrows) and maybe just bad enough that I could love it. Too bad it's literally unavailable everywhere, so I gave up.

Enter: mindless online window shopping because I drank my tea too late in the afternoon and couldn't fall asleep. Anticlimactically (though maybe a mercy for you) because my child now demands my attention but I must finish what I've started, I was blissfully browsing vintage Celine Boston bags when I happened upon the fine specimen attached to this post, the matchless Mulberry Emmy 😎 I'm a firm believer that oftentimes in fashion three lefts do make a right. She's a loathsome shade of tan, she has an abominable face, she's no doubt heavy as a hellhound, and I cannot WAIT to wear the living sh\*t out of her. As always, thanks for indulging me ✨

\*the photo attached is from Mulberry’s website, and while nearly identical to mine, is not the exact same bag. I just like their photo better lol. Also if you saw this before, no you didn’t ty\*",2024-12-13 16:47:30+00:00,10,8

Hello 🌻 I've been looking at the Emmy for a bit, wanting to add a white bag to my collection however I am aware how white might get dirtier, marks easier... So would you do it or not? I was thinking of buying a much cheaper white bag but also I just feel it's throwing my money away. For some, the prices of Coach might not be a lot but for me it's what I let myself spend on bags. ☺️

I also adore the green or the pink one, I do have a pink Longchamp and Brooklyn in lime green very different green but still green hence why I am also hesitant.

I guess I am simply asking if a white bag is worth it or if it's gonna be a real pain in the bum haha.

1h14xmv,handbags,Planning my next big girl bag,"Hello everyone! I wanted to get feedback/thoughts on these bags, as I'm planning my next ""nice"" bag purchase. I've had a somewhat up and down year and would like to treat myself to something with my new raise. 

What kind of bag I'm looking for:  
Something nicer I can use for everyday and sometimes work. I'm leaning towards a suede bag because I'm liking the look of them now, but worried about taking care of it long-term because it rains a lot where I live. My first branded bag I bought new was a Songmont Luna, and I love it! But I want something with more space and to expand my collection. :D I also have a couple of thrifted Coach bags, but they're pretty beaten up at this point. 

Options:  
1. Coach Brooklyn 28 in Cedar (possibly also black or red or the green) - I loved the silhouette the moment I saw it, and have tried it on several times and I like the space, the closure, and the feel. I was considering the Cedar color because I'm into suede bags now, and it looks like the color I want, but this currently isn't in stock where I live (though for this bag I'm really willing to wait for a restock lol)  
2. Mango Double handle suede leather bag - saw this when browsing for more affordable suede bags! I haven't bought from Mango in years, so not sure how the quality is now. I haven't seen this yet in person, but it's the cheapest bag on the list.   
3. Songmont Medium Song Bag in Agarwood - I've been wanting a song bag for a while and I really do love this color and shape! I feel like it would be convenient for me and the way I plan to use this bag with it being open and having an organizer as well  
4. Songmont Mini Song Bag in Lucky Red - ok this is just for fun but HOW CUTE is this tiny little red bag 🥹 This purchase can wait but I just love a cute red bag

Open to suggestions from everyone please!! I'm very new to this world, so any advice or feedback on these bags would be appreciated a lot.

1h14lc9,handbags,"First mid-range bag, can’t decide!","Looking for a chic, black, timeless bag that is good quality and has both a shoulder and cross body (budget £200-300), and feeling so overwhelmed with options, especially with the Black Friday sales!  all this is new to me and I don’t know many brands. 

I was looking at Coach as on here people seem to like the quality, also maybe Kate spade (although I associate this brand with older women, not sure why!) but if anyone has any other brand suggestions I’d love to hear them. 

In terms of style, I was eyeing up the coach Andrea from their outlet but then read bad things about the outlet bags quality. The other bags I like are the Brooklyn, Juliette and miracle. I really wanted gold hardware so may have to compromise as some have silver. I do really love the Brooklyn but it looks like the only way to close it is a popper with some open space either side still. I’ve been pickpocketed in the past so I want a bag that had either a zip or another way to fully close it so pickpockets can’t dip their hands in. 

Any advice appreciated! I also don’t know much about fashion/style so it’s hard to know which style will be more timeless!

I also looked at the tabby as seen it mentioned here but I’m not a fan of the shape of the bag, but could potentially be persuaded haha",2024-11-27 13:42:58+00:00,6,4

 I'm looking for one like it but that has lots of space (I have lots of medications/inhalers that need to brought along everywhere). I really like the structure and the compactness of the way they look, not really a big fan of how big/chunky classic bags looks like. I know that sounds like a contradiction to my need for a bigger size, but I'd like a bigger size with the same structure if that makes sense, not as ""pouchy"" like as the 00's mom bags.

1gwrgm4,handbags,Help me choose,"I’ve been a lurker here for a bit and am finally deciding to buy my first mid range bags this Black Friday.

I’ve already decided to buy the Strathberry Charlotte drawstring bag in caramel and am also looking to get a black bag. I’m torn between the Strathberry mini tote and Coach quilted tabby.

Coach - I’m old enough to remember seeing coach everywhere and had an aversion to the brand until I saw this bag on a post recently. I’m not a fan of the Big C on the bag and am not sure how visible it will be with black on black (I don’t have any coach stores around me to see it in person). The bag, however, seems like a great everyday bag.

Strathberry - I love the style of the bag but am not sure how convenient the metal bar is to keep opening and closing the bag. I’m also not sure how it will wear either.

Does anyone have both / one of the bags and have a preference? Even if you don’t have the bags, I’m keen to hear your thoughts!

1gvrtjl,handbags,Help me decide! Buy a mini bag during Black Friday or treat myself to a big bag next year?,"For context, I did not grow up in money. I always bought vegan leather bags that broke in a couple of years so when I started making my own money, I saved up for real leather and branded bags. 

I am happy that I was able to grow my collection, I own a couple of outlet bags (Coach, Kate Spade, Michael Kors), a Longchamp in coated canvas and a Dooney and Bourke. 

But since I got a new job with a huge pay hike, I’ve been thinking of treating myself to a nicer bag. As someone who’s never bought retail, I wanted to give myself that. So I was considering maybe getting the Coach pillow tabby in 26 which I’ve had on my wish list forever but it turns out they don’t sell it anymore. 

Long story short, I have my eye on a couple of bags wanted to take advantage of — Furla Diamanté mini in Black, Songmont Luna in Taupe, and the Demellier New York large in black.

The three are very different, obviously. And I was saving up for the Demellier since I don’t own a tote in black or neutral (my lovely Longchamp is in a pale pink). But I’m seeing all the Black Friday sales and I’m torn between getting either the Furla or the Songmont one now. As these are smaller, I plan to use them for casual wear, going to the mall, meeting with friends, or short trips.

I really like how chic the Furla Diamanté one looks, but I’ve heard really good reviews about the Songmont Luna and it can be worn 3 ways. 

I actually already have several bags of the same size but I wanted a little treat since I just got a pay hike 🥺 

QUESTION — do you think I should bite the bullet and get either the Songmont or the Furla which I’ve been eyeing for years, or do I save up for the Demellier which I fell in love with a couple of months ago? ",2024-11-20 15:18:02+00:00,3,5

Unfortunately I don't know much about bags, and so would appreciate any recommendations! I'm looking for a deep dark brown leather shoulder bag with gold hardware. I want a zipper, minimal branding, and I like a structured/semi-structured look (but it's not a must!). My friends and I have been looking for ages, but I still haven't found a bag that's ""just right,"" so I would appreciate any suggestions. I know a lot of people have been looking for dark brown bags for fall, so I've been checking those posts and have scoured through a lot of the more popular sites on here (Polene, Strathberry, Songmont, etc.), but I still haven't found one I really loved, so I welcome any niche recs as well!

Here are a few of my running favorites and my thoughts on them - I'm hoping to keep cost under $500, if possible!

* [Verafied hobo bag](https://verafiedny.com/products/gold-chocolate-hobo-bag?variant=47652190650675&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAA9pwGbILTuul8uO-OwY53h1AwaLAB&gclid=Cj0KCQjwgL-3BhDnARIsAL6KZ6-M1djx_mVRgL08LmbdNe9O_O7nECW5-8QNtZ-HT_7g9GXBrHfSnPsaAsNvEALw_wcB) \- this is probably my top contender right now: I love the lock and key!
* [Coach Brooklyn bag](https://www.coach.com/products/brooklyn-shoulder-bag-23/CW614.html?frp=CW614+B4%2FBK) \- I love this one, and if it had a zipper I would get it no questions asked. But as it is, I worry both about the clasp and the fact that pretty much everyone will have one of these - hoping for something a little less trendy so that it won't look out of place in a few years!
* [Freja Roma bag](https://frejanyc.com/products/roma-bag-espresso) \- this one is maybe a little on the boring side, but super cute and classic: that said, it's vegan leather. I don't know anything about it, but is this a fair price for vegan leather, and would it last? I've also heard bad things about their hardware.
* [Coach Cary bag](https://www.bloomingdales.com/shop/product/coach-cary-crossbody?ID=5096238&CategoryID=1004772) \- I love Coach! I also love their maple color, but that said, a lot of their bags have a little too much branding for me (I don't like the giant C on the tabby bags right now- I have an older one that doesn't have that, and it's my favorite bag of all time!). I know people like the Juliet and Junos, and they are super cute but for some reason I'm just not crazy about them. That said, those are both options I'm considering as well
* [Vince Camuto](https://www.vincecamuto.com/products/vince-camuto-maire-shoulder-bag-sandalwood?variant=45732711825575&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=21594463675&utm_content=%7C&gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI5JfwqPDtiAMV1DfUAR2XyxHWEAQYCCABEgKgFvD_BwE) \- I'm not sure about the quality of this brand, but for some reason I really like the reverse triangle shape (sorry, I'm sure there's a much fancier name) and the coin. However, again I don't like that it's just a magnetic clasp.
* [Manu Atelier](https://manuatelier.com/products/three-zipped-baguette-deep-brown) \- this is cute and I like that it's a little different, but the zippers are way too long and would drive me crazy

To be honest, what I really want is a Demellier Tokyo bag or something very like that. They have [this one](https://demellierlondon.com/products/the-tokyo-mocha-shearling-mocha-smooth?variant=45536897532078) in mocha, and I found another one somewhere in suede, but I don't like the shearling or suede. I'd just love the mocha color in actual leather, if that exists somewhere! If not, I'd appreciate any recommendations for anything similar.

Thank you so much for your help!! I've been driving myself and my laptop crazy with this (I have like 50 different tabs of bags open), and I literally made this reddit account exactly for this after having held out for years. Any recommendations or thoughts would be much appreciated!

1gqbcy4,handbags,Shoulder/Cross body black leather bag,"Hi everyone,

I am looking for a shoulder/cross body black leather bag with gold hardware and would love some suggestions! I am in Europe and have a budget of 400 euros (hoping for a lot less or scoring something great in the black friday sales).

I would like something that would be a great everyday bag, but also for going out. Medium sized, but on the smaller side?

For reference:

* I like the coach soft tabby, but I would prefer it if the bag had a zipper.
* A couple of months ago, I was obsessed with the tabby 26, but not anymore. The logo might be too big for me...

Immediately sent it back, it looked so ugly in real life, the crinkly leather texture and the color just seemed so icky to me. 
Pic for reference, not mine since I was so bummed out, I didn't even want to see it longer than 30 seconds, not to mention take a photo :D 
I guess I just am a smooth leather kinda girl (my favorite smooth leather bags I own that I can't stop swooning over are the Coach novelty Moon bag and the pillow tabby). Have you ever felt as disappointed about a bag and what was it?

1gmkglf,handbags,I'm considering to redesign this bag I made two years back. ,"Whenever I see Coach Brooklyn on this subreddit, I'm reminded of a bag I made two years ago. Both designs are quite basic, sharing some similarities. As this was one of my first bag designs, I’m considering building a refined version.
I’m planning a few key changes for the new bag:
 * Plain Stitching: I’ve received feedback about the exposed zig-zag stitching on the sides, as it's more susceptible to snagging on sharp edges. I'll switch to a more durable plain stitch.
 * Brass Feet: Given the bag's hard bottom, I believe adding brass feet would be a practical and stylish upgrade, allowing it to stand upright.
 * Straight Zippers: The current design features zippers sewn onto curved leather pieces. I'll simplify this by using straight-cut leather sides, making the zippers easier to operate.
 * Adjustable Handles: I plan to incorporate longer, adjustable handles with brass buckles for both functionality and aesthetic appeal. Additionally, I'll refine the attachment point of the handles, which currently appears a bit cluttered.
* Painted edges 
I'd love to hear your thoughts and suggestions on these changes. Thank you!",2024-11-08 14:58:55+00:00,20,11

The coach Brooklyn has the look I love but why WHY are we so against zippers ?! I hate open bags and open totes. It’s the only thing stopping me from buying it. I’m not really a bag within a bag person..I just gonna throw my stuff in my bag and hope for the best. 

Under $400, what would you grab? Perhaps my indecisiveness is because nothing is really screaming “yes bring me home”. 

I’ve eyed the Kate spade dumpling but I don’t like the handles - same reason I don’t want the Lana even though I love the shape of both. 


I’ve looked at Aimee kestenberg but I’m on the fence because I don’t see her posted a lot so I know nothing about the quality. Cuyana leather looks so soft in the photos I’ve seen online - but I’m also only 5’2” and don’t want to look like a total clown. Also I feel like a tote is just a bit too big for an every day carry.

I recently bought a bunch of bags that are hyped up, and while I truly enjoy these bags now, I don't know if I'll regret these purchases next year if they're not ""trendy"" anymore. Is there a way to tell if a bag is just trendy or if it's truly timeless? or is there no way to tell 🙃",2024-11-01 18:41:52+00:00,0,5
1ggfu41,handbags,Looking for an every day bag!,"Here’s my criteria:

Sand/nude color
Able to wear over the shoulder (bonus if it has a long crossbody strap as well, but I don’t want a strictly crossbody bag)
Something with some sort of closure (zipper preferred but magnet would be fine
Budget- prefer to spend less on this bag since I’m planning a bigger purchase for a black evening bag as well. Maybe less than $500? Willing to do around $1200 if it’s a luxury brand.
Probably something a small/medium size. Big enough to fit keys, wallet, AirPods, body spray, hand sanitizer etc. But not the size of a tote.

I’ve been gravitating toward slouchy hobo styles for an everyday bag with not as much structure. Thinking maybe something like a Coach Brooklyn. If money were no object, I love something like the Givenchy Voyou in medium. If anyone has either of these bags I’d love to know how they work for you!

1gfkms6,handbags,Brooklyn 28 in Maple - A love story,"I had this bag on pre-order from Neiman Marcus since its been sold out on the Coach website, it was set to ship before December and I was willing to wait.

I happened to run into the mall after work yesterday to make a return at Anthro, and stopped by Coach with the intention of trying the bag in a different color just to make sure it was fitting for me and looked as good in person. I walked in and THERE SHE WAS.

The SA came over and asked if I was looking for something specific, and I instantly responded ""literally this bag"" and she said they had just gotten her in that morning - what are the odds, it was fate. She got her off the shelf so I could try her out and I was instantly in love and knew I needed it immediately.

The SA was amazing and was helping me pick out a wallet and showing me different charms - they ultimately didn't have the matching wallet in the style I wanted and it was sold out online as well so she couldn't get it ordered for me yet, but I was actually able to get it on amazon. I considered a mismatched wallet for a minute but held off because I really prefer matching, and also skipped the charm for now because I'm sure I'll be back in. She got me checked out and even gave me my 10% birthday discount, when I went to pay I pulled my wallet out that matches the current rogue bag I was wearing and the SA goes ""oh I see it you ARE a matchy person"". AND I didn't know this but they monogram the tags on the bag for free in store?! Worth buying in store just for that, I honestly had a 10/10 experience and the SA was so amazing.

So I cancelled my Neiman pre-order and I just can't stop staring at this bag. She's relatively reasonably priced and super high quality, and I'm obsessed with how casual and mature this bag looks.

I also got to try on the hunter green swing bag and hamptons hobo I have been eyeing for a while now (swing zip has been in my coach cart over a year) and its a miracle I didn't walk out with one of those bags too because I'm so indecisive. Who knows maybe I will come back for one of those because both bags were stunning and the green is so beautiful in person!

1gelkvs,handbags,Coach Nina Tote,"So I was here to share my latest birthday bag in the Merlot color, which I haven’t seen before and was instantly obsessed with. But then I realized I really wanted to rant and rave about the Nina tote as a whole. 

First of all this color is incredible. I was too excited to wait for daylight to get you a good picture even but the Merlot is like a deep burgundy wine red. It will be perfect for fall. This is my 4th Nina tote…. Yes I have a problem but I also have a practical use. I started a graduate MFT program in August with a dress code and really wanted/ needed a bag that was professional looking, free standing, and durable/ practical. The moment I saw the Nina in the outlet stores I was sold. 

Nina is timeless, sleek, and honestly kindof gives quiet luxury. My first two were the beige and black/gold croc, which I bought at the same time. I later found a non embossed plain chestnut leather/ gold at TJ Maxx and knew what I had to do. And when I went in for a birthday Tabby I ended up walking out with Miss Merlot. (Tabby is a goal for me but she doesn’t go on sale and I can’t justify her until I get the big girl job). 

This tote just continues to impress me the more I use it, which is daily. I of course rotate through the very neutral colors regularly and store them in their dust bags. I also am very careful with them, using a chair hook to keep them upright in the car and being careful not to bend or dent them while carrying, packing, and setting down in class. And I load these girls up to the max. Old chunky 13 inch Mac fits in the zipper pocket, an iPad and coach notebook in the other, Stanley water bottle, a smaller box of toiletries, one for pens and stationary, sometimes a small sweater, you name it. The straps have not shown a single sign of wear and everything looks just as new as the day I got it. These will last (and stay in style) for decades probably. 

They also are just well designed. The zipper sleeves span the entire sides of the bag, and don’t pucker or pooch easily even if you stuff them a little too much. The inside is fairly open, with two phone sized pockets and a pen holder. I personally prefer the open concept so there is less liner to catch and possibly tear and I can configure things how I need which is different day by day. I also have a lot of smaller organizers I use. The magnetic closure on the center compartment is so strong sometimes it is actually mildly annoying when trying to break the bag in and struggling to shove things in quickly lol. It’s just wide enough to keep things in but also be able to slide my water bottle in or out too. I also love how structured the bag is and it also has little metal feet to protect the leather on the bottom. It does not tip easily either, other than in the car if you aren’t careful and just toss it on the passenger seat. I would definitely consider using this as a personal item on flights but personally would cover it because I’m crazy and particular. Normally I load it to the max and it gets heavy quickly, but I finally used it the other day with only a few things in it and it was a very comfortable carry, not any more cumbersome or difficult than any other purse. 

Overall this bag is so classy and also just screams therapist or professional lol. I get compliments on every color all the time. Coach just really nailed this one. ",2024-10-29 03:38:43+00:00,16,3

Instead of an LV purse, this Tory Burch popped up in the shopping search results. It’s technically more the LV Speedy Nano size but with a $400 price tag, I thought I’d give it a try! It does have the crossbody strap, hard to see in the photos.

Very impressed upon unpacking! The size looks small but it holds a lot. I’m not a large handbag girl and carry as minimal items as possible. A crossbody is almost always my go to. I’ve been carrying an LV wristlet, but wanted the extra comfortability of it being more on my body. I recently bought & returned the Coach Brooklyn 28 bc I couldn’t do the shoulder carry & size of the bag.

1g931sn,handbags,It's okay to not feed into trends.,"I am a chronic trend follower of handbags. If I see everyone raving about something, then I must have it. I recently picked up the Coach Brooklyn 28 in Ruby and Suede. I ended up returning both since I didn't love the suede and red isn't a color I carry nearly often enough. I did like the silhouette, however. I didn't love it, but despite knowing that, I thought, ""Everyone else is loving this bag! I have to love it."" After returning both, I continued stalking the Coach site until the Maple color was restocked. That arrived, and not too soon after, I returned it as well. If you couldn't tell, I bought 3 of the most popular colors thinking it was the color that I didn't love. Nope, I just didn't love the bag and that's ok. There's always going to be something trending, and I must acknowledge that I may not just like it despite all the hype.

About 2 years back I bought my first proper mid luxury brand which was coach pillow tabby in above colour. For some reason I have never been able to use it as much (except for right in the beginning). 

Part of the reason was that I saw soooo many of these bags on reseller platforms. 

Though I am now trying to wear it more consciously, I am very keen to hear everyone’s thoughts here on this bag? Yay or nay? Should I try to sell it at a loss or just style it better?

* preferably under $600 USD

It is just the perfect every day bag in terms of size, it’s so versatile, and I can easily style it up with charms. I feel like this would be the most practical choice. Also, I love the cherry charm, and the cherry charm was made for this bag. 

BUT, I pretty much own all black purses. AND, All the purses I have are also either huge or way to small.

I've been looking for a deep red bag to add to my collection and I saw that there are a couple new releases!

* Leo et Violette - Le Marcia - Burgundy
* Polene - Numero Dix - Black Cherry

I'm looking into purchasing a casual chocolate brown bag for fall to wear with my Boston's. Top of my list are Coach's Brooklyn Shoulder Bag 39 and Michael Kors' Nolita Large Nubuck Hobo Shoulder Bag. 

Has anyone purchased either or have an opinion? I generally buy Coach, Kate Spade, Tory Burch but don't have much Michael Kors. How's the quality? Leaning towards Kors to take advantage of the sale but not 100% convinced. I'm open to other lower/moderately priced recommendations of excellent quality as well!

Unfortunately, I still feel unsatisfied with my final options so I look to you, my fellow handbag lovers— HELP is needed! 

This purse will memorialize my career achievements and a new season of life. I’d like a few recommendations and opinions on the contenders I’ve come up with.

Does anyone have recommendations within this criteria:
- leather
- black
- quilted
- leather threaded chain strap
- shoulder strap with crossbody option
- gold/brass hardware
- not MK or Kate Spade
- less than or around $600 

Contenders:
- Coach Tabby shoulder bag 26
- Aspinal of London Lottie shoulder bag (nappa)

If you would choose the Aspinal over Coach, can you detail why? I’d like to stick to <$600 but am willing to go higher if it makes sense!

1fh6jgz,handbags,Help Me Find an Everyday Shoulder Bag,"Hello!

My sister got me the Polene Cyme mini in textured taupe for my birthday but the company canceled and refunded the order. Now, the only way I can get the bag is via preorder, which I don’t want to do for personal reasons (long story). 

I was given the money refunded to her and told to find something else or to just do the preorder. 

I am very upset about this whole situation for Family Drama Reasons, but I am trying to reframe and make the best of it. I know that even if I get the Polene eventually, the Family Drama will be forever associated with it. For this reason, I think the best thing to do is to choose something new, something that lights my fire and makes me excited for this new bag instead of resentful. 

However, I cannot find something in-stock that fits the specifications below and it’s driving me nuts…

Any help would be greatly appreciated. 

- taupe or mushroom color (to wear any season, with black or brown)
- big enough for a journal and makeup bag, but NOT big enough for a laptop
- no fussy closures or anything inconvenient 
- shoulder bag. Not crossbody. 
- Classic but soft
- no obvious branding. I’d like something iykyk that speaks to taste and quality.
- $500 or less

Here are bags I’ve considered but don’t do it for me…
- songmont Luna (not big enough)
- songmont medium song (not big enough)
- Cuyana double loop medium (fine, but not special or unique enough)
- coach brooklyn 28 in Stone (it’s fine? Again, it doesn’t feel unique)
- coach lana in stone (not delicate or feminine enough)
- Mansur Gavriel Soft Lady bag in Biscotto (looks too dark to be taupe, fussy opening, out of price range)

I’ve asked my mom and sister for suggestions but my mom keeps sending me structured top handle bags with crossbody straps, and my sister refuses to help in the search.

1f1bpi3,handbags,Is a back-up bag a silly idea? ,"While my go-to bag is my LV Pochette Métis, I have been LOVING my Coach Tabby 26 in Dark Stone/Brass. 

Y’ALL. 

The love is real for this one. I’ve been so stinkin’ happy with this lil bag that I put my PM back in its dust bag (😱) for a little while as I’ve been taking it to work every daily. I’ve never been a Coach girly, but this one has made my heart so happy.

My question is, should I purchase a back-up Tabby 26 in the same color way? I saw it’s completely sold out but gosh I’ll be devastated if something happens to it. 

Is this a stupid thing to do? I have brought my collection down to just three bags as I’m trying to keep to a minimalist collection (plus I plan on purchasing one more bag by the end of year to round out my rotation), so should I even think about this? Was going to purchase on EBay or Poshmark if I can find one that’s almost brand new/in good shape.

I have 3 bags from Coach that I am thinking of selling. I don’t know if I should because I am really torn.

However, both the bandit and the pillow tabby look very luxurious to me??? So I don’t know 😭 Am I just overthinking?

I feel like as the day goes by and I collect more bags, I’m kind of questioning the previous bags I bought (if that makes sense). Please help your girl out. 

Apart from these bags, I also have the following Coach bags in my collection (just wanted to share in case this helps):

1eypzlg,handbags,Unisex crossbody recommendations under 300 USD that can fit an iPad?,"Currently looking for a good quality leather crossbody bag that’s big enough to fit an iPad 10th gen. Although I’ve also been looking at other crossbody bags to get to start my collection. I’d prefer if it’s below 300 USD and can ship internationally. For reference, I’m 5’8 with a medium to large frame. 

Some of the items I’m eyeing are

1. The Horse Clementine - love the silhouette of this bag but the strap is too short for my frame :(
2. Coach Cary Crossbody - been really looking into this but it’s phased out already and there’s no way to get it into my country
3. Tocco Toscano Marlows - my first pick out of the three but it’s kinda similar to my Coach Soft Tabby in terms of look.

I tend to match my shoes to my bags so I’m in search of a small crossbody / shoulder bag / mini tote (think Polene numero neuf mini, Bottega Jodie mini, Coach Tabby vibes) that is as close to the colour of the sandals as possible. I’m looking for something pretty minimalist and simple with little to no branding, and priced in the mid range. 

For context, I have the Polene numero neuf mini in taupe, and find this is slightly too warm and has rosy undertones which don’t go with the sandals

My bag collection has grown quite a bit over the last 2-3 years. I started in the world of Coach (what I could afford at the time) and since then I have been obsessed with the world of bags. So many of them have special places in my heart, from the Louis Vuitton Danube bag my late grandma helped me get, the Off White Camera bag my husband got me, the Keepall 25 I bought when I received a promotion at work, to my mother in law getting me my first small Gucci crossbody when she was in Italy as present. 

My bag collection is not huge but I appreciate, worked hard and love to carry each one. I 100% have faves though, as we all do. My top carried recently have been the Gucci small top handle bag, my Keepall 25 top handle & my Jacquemus black Le Baneto.  But I do swap them out pretty often and after pulling them all out have ones I need to alternate back into my regular rotation. 

Bag that I would love to add to my collection would be the Gucci Ophidia (I love the webbing) crescent crossbody & Medium shoulder bag, the Bottega Intrecciato hobo & a duffle for travel. However I haven’t decided which house yet for sure I want a duffle from. I go back and forth between a few- so many good ones!

Hopefully I am doing this right- since it is my first upload but I love a bag, the bag world, the bag collectors and seeing all the different collections people have.
