1ju1omy,Plumbing,Advice on fixing cold water intake leak into navien tankless,"The small leak is somewhere within or near the circled region. The leak is only present when running multiple fixtures and is not present with typical hot water usage. Right now my plan is to secure piece 1 and loosen piece 2. Once those pieces are apart I would put back together with tape then dope. I’m looking to see if I’m on the right track or there’s another route I should take. Knowing how expensive these can be to service, I was hoping for some feedback before I get into it. Any input is much appreciated. ",2025-04-08 01:16:02+00:00,1,0
1ju1oh7,AmITheJerk,AITJ For not standing up for myself while people make fun of me and my feelings.,"Sorry about my grammar it's just I'm really sleepy and i don't feel like using grammar right now

Hey there, Reddit. There isn't much significance to my name, but what matters is my book, where I record everything, I feel and all my darkest thoughts. It's important to note that I am a minor, and I won't talk to my parents about this because they are terrible. What's it called when someone traps you in a house doesn't let you talk to people and throws away your clothes that aren't inappropriate in any way and they call yell at you and call you dumb for not being able to spell somethings and not being able to do math, math is just hard for some people why doesn't just understand that, sorry getting off track any ways like i said my book holds all my feelings and I'm not the person to stand up for myself depending on who you are I now stand up for myself against my mom and my grandma who hates me and my dad i can't stand up to him because he likes to hang my weekly allowance over my and doesn't give it to me if i share my opinion like he doesn't know that i use that money to buy me food I'm quite mature as a 13yo anyway back to the book the biggest reason that i have this book in the first is to share my feelings with someone yes i have gone to therapy before but my mom was in the room so i was unable to say what i needed to say to help me back to the book so this book holds my feelings so it's very important to me now the day of this thing happened last year in winter we were outside trying to make a fire for some perfect melted chocolates and marshmallows and you need a started to start a fire so i ran down to my grandma's house to get some paper and my older sister let's call her Mickky goes into my room and gets my book to take outside to get some paper from it i didn't know that she got my book because i was and grams house i came back running and i see my book i ran over and took it then she started saying some of the things i wrote and she was laughing as she was saying i just ran inside i just kept thinking about this every single day and my family is the family that believes words are alive so if i say something like i feel like dying today then I'm wrong so am I the asshole for not standing up for myself back then and sometimes now because she stills makes fun of me for it.

Sorry about my grammar it's just I'm really sleepy and i don't feel like using grammar right now",2025-04-08 01:15:48+00:00,1,0
1ju1ofi,Plumbing,It’s not my PCV valve! Help!,"My plumber friend told me it was the PCV valve… my house drops 20+ psi every toilet flush and drops significantly if more than one faucet is running.
I replaced the PCV, no luck…thought it was faulty, did it again. No luck! Plumber comes out replumbs everything with a new PCV valve. Still nothing.
He checks the water meter and finds rocks and debris in the meters screens. So he tells me to contact my HOA. Debris is clogging up the screen and they need to fix it.
HOA tells me to contact the Water District… WTF!
Questions:
Would debris coming from the street cause my PCV valve to not regulate properly?
Is there anything else it could be? 
Will the water district ever fix this or am I screwed?

1ju1oaq,GlobalEntry,Using GE mobile phone while declaring an apple,"Silly me opted to make a declaration on the GE app about a single apple which I had carried from the origin airport lounge. I assumed they’d just give me the option to discard it. Instead they escorted me to customs in a courteous fashion and followed the full procedure to note my passport, enter me into the system, and run my bag through the scanner before declaring “fruits aren’t allowed into the US”. The whole thing felt silly. And I feel like I pranked myself. ",2025-04-08 01:15:33+00:00,1,0
1ju1oak,Capitalism,Is capitalism still relevant in a world where the value of human labour is depreciating?,"As technology is getting more and more advanced, we all know a lot of labor will be replaced by Ai. We expect an emergence of new jobs to fill the void, but the question of the century is- as ai gets more and more developed will the ratio of replacement to emergence be the same. A vast majority of replaced jobs will be low skilled workers and medium skilled workers, which will account for the majority of people. We have no certainty that an equal number of jobs will be created except a past preced of industrial revolution which may not repeat and the baseless optimism of those who have their interests linked with ai.

Communism was a failed ideology. Humans won't work hard if they are not paid in tandem with effort. But capitalism has left a world that is obsessed with money, but it is understandable since our life is linked with money. But if capitalism continues through the ai revolution, we may have few people who can still work, people who own everything, and a group that has a unknown fate whether universal income, transition to entertainment or some meanigless of complicated job.

But what will happen to people who are not skilled enough to do what is not doable by ai?

But lets move onto the question, is capitalism still relevant today, currently i do think there is no good alternative for capitalism, since all communist nations are either market socialist with some like china being more capitalist than socialist. North korea, cuba, and laos are authoritarian and are just a fake democracy. There is no modern democratic communist nation. it's all capitalist. And those that are communist are not truly communist.

Absolute power corrupts absolutely, and any new comunist party that holds power absolutely will never function properly. But if there were multiple parties with equal chance of governance, wouldn't the communist nation have a bare minimum competition for efficency among political parties, hence making it a possible alternative. With modern technology acting as base for the motivationless worker to produce just as much. We may not reach the efficiency of capitalism today, but as technology grows, the practicality of communism grows with it.

If the human race is defined by a need for growth, why isn't that desire for growth allocated to the economic system. Or is it possible that we will never find a better form of running the economy in the next billion years than capitalism. 

Now i have made many assumptions, i may seem biased to communism but i am mostly biased against an eternal capitalistic world, if there is an better economic system that can replace this gross commodification of the world, i just wish for that. We are given a gift of life. We are given a chance to understand ourselves and the universe, to obsess in that period over material wealth seems like a waste. Physical and mental Health should not be a commodity but a service.


Tldr; there is no tldr, i sincerely hope you read this with whatever attention you can gather and engage in discourse.

1ju1o8m,AsoiafFanfiction,Aemon and Baelon swap wives,"Okay so in one of my CK2 runs I made a rather interesting change? In that I got Alyssa and Aemon married and Baelon paired with Jocelyn and that got me thinking of these two changed wives what would happen?

From what I remember of the run I think one of their kids from both sides ending up marrying in Aerea’s line (somehow she survived and I’m pretty sure she married Corlys?) which could give a bit more depth to the Dance. I still wanna include the Hightowers as part of it so maybe they marry into Aemon’s line, with Baelon’s kids marrying into his other siblings I think it was Viserra who became the wife of one son and Daella? Whose Blackwood daughter married another.

I’m just curious how the Dance would still happen in this case with all these changes? I suppose some stuff in canon could happen like the GC of 101 in they both predecease Jaehaerys with Aemon and Alyssa’s sons dying early and only having granddaughters as well as a surviving daughter?

1ju1nzc,polydating,"[F4M] 32F/US/ I wanted to reach out to anyone that wants to be my friend/get to know me. I will be here for 24 hours waiting on any missed contacts, so I thought I would touch base with people that have missed out on contacting me.","Okay, some updates here for my profile. I thought I would make one last update before I go.

I never clarified, but I thought I should let people know that I randomly send voice clips out on Discord when gaming; that is honestly what is more comfortable for me. Being on the spectrum, I can't handle a long period of time on a phone. Unless you like the conversation to be, uh, paused for 30 seconds and then come up with a few more sentences, then rinse and repeat. I also personally get easily distracted while playing a game and trying to find something to say, and then, uhhhhh, 30 seconds and get a few sentences out. It's a lot easier for me to send voice clips when I want when we're playing video games together.

A handful of people expressed disappointment that all my games that are in co-op mode worldwide are on Nintendo. I'm sorry about that. If you want to know what I thought about the Nintendo Switch 2 and prices, you can read here in a post I made on r/SadCornerOfGamers. You can read there, and I wonder if anyone knows what video game pictures I used for the profile picture and background picture that I used. I wonder if you can send a chat request if you know we would be awesome friends if you do know!

I will say I've been a Nintendo membership subscriber for 4 years and counting, just the $20 a year plan though, so I guess that really shows that, yeah, all my co-op games are on Nintendo, haha.

I get asked about Minecraft if I played Minecraft on the Switch but not on the PC. But I'm sure the readers probably already knew this already, haha.  I don't know where the cartridge is; I have to find the game again. I've not played this game in ages, and I really mean that, because every time I played Minecraft for 30 minutes or an hour, I would nod off and doze off because the game was too relaxing, haha.

Final notes.

Send everything by chat request and not by commenting. If you would like to send your Discord handles over to my chat request, then please do so, but before you do, please make an entry on why you would like to get to know me.

Well, yes, that person said I had a bad attitude because I asked for Reddit users to go on their mobile app to look at the communities that I joined, because that's the only way you can look at what communities the Reddit users have joined—only through mobile. Anyways, the person said I had a bad attitude about this because he claimed I'm taking the fun out of people getting to know me as a person, and it's always best to ask the person naturally about themselves besides looking at their profile.

Um, okay? No, that doesn't ruin anything to get to know me naturally at all; these are conversation starters, conversation boosters, and a general idea on how to start a conversation with me, and if you claim that I've ruined the chance to get to know me just by looking at my communities that I've joined through the Reddit app or looking at my profile for 5-10 minutes, then that's just terrible; you basically have run out of conversations to have with me, which is quite hilarious if you're already out of conversations just by doing those simple steps.

Why am I leaving Reddit? I asked this several times in my inbox a few days ago, and it's simple. I did explain already, so I will just copy and paste the reasons here.

The last thing I will say is I never felt welcomed either because apparently people think I have a bad attitude when I ask someone to look at the communities that I've joined through the mobile app of Reddit to figure out conversation starters. Remember it's not that bad to be quirky, fun, and unique, and not only that, it's seriously not that bad to be a tad bit different than everyone else that doesn't let themselves sit in a box of normality. So, with that being said, the best way for this situation is just to leave.  


If you want a deeper meaning on why I'm leaving Reddit, okay, sure, I guess if that is what you want.

Keep waving your red flag around for people to see, one person commented on my posts.

I had to delete several of my posts, not the one previously but the one before that. Several people were commenting on my posts when I didn't ask for people to comment on my post at all, which I think should be respected in the OP posts. If the Reddit user says, Don't comment, then don't comment on the posts. But this is where things steer off in the dark seas. Oof, OMG, really? Just why would anyone post a comment like this, which can draw unnecessary drama to me, which caused me to delete my posts because I didn't want people flooding my chat requests, and I had to block several users so those people wouldn't comment again when I repost. Anyways, these people were posting comments about.

You seem in distress about relationships. I think you should go see a relationship therapist specialist, find out about positive reinforcements, and then talk to your therapist about relationship goals to have before going into a relationship. Um, WTF? I can't believe someone honestly typed out a WHOLE PARAGRAPH ABOUT THIS! But that's not all; this is where things get really no comment. Hi, I really think you need to go to therapy for a few years to get your PTSD treatment to help with your flashbacks and nightmares so you can have healthier relationships. Um, WTF? Okay, first and foremost, I think before going on posting on people's posts that didn't even want comments in the first place, you don't have any right to vouch for couch doctor suggestions when you don't have PTSD, and clearly you don't; you're one of those people that think PTSD is all about nightmares and flashbacks, and you don't even take into account that those aren't the whole core aspects of PTSD in general. PTSD is so much more than flashbacks and nightmares, which, to be honest with everyone as someone with PTSD, I don't have nightmares and flashbacks anymore, but I do suffer from the mood/behavioral PTSD problems, which people apparently don't think exist for people with PTSD because people like the couch doctor that hid and sat on Reddit telling me about treating my PTSD flashbacks and nightmares for a healthier relationship totally forget that mood/behavioral problems are a huge core factor for people with PTSD. So, for people that want to play couch doctor and don't have PTSD themselves, please don't comment on people's Reddit posts when the OP never asked. Because on my posts I didn't, and I was looking for friends to talk about relationship issues, and if the person thinks they are cursed in having relationships, which I mean if people are creeped out about that on Reddit, that is a topic that I want to talk about from time to time to get things off my mind, then that's on you, because it's not really a creepy thing to ask. Because apparently there were a handful of people that wanted to converse in that and get to know me, so apparently there isn't an issue with this, and it seems to me that a person with just a normal small box view of the world seems to have an issue with it.

But you should stay to keep chatting with those handful of people that get you; you just have to wait out the storm and wait for these rare people that get you.

No thanks, I understand what you're saying, but I'd rather just leave and just be on Discord, and for people that truly want to get to know me, there is a way outside of here to do so, which I've left on my pinned posts. If you've missed out on this post and missed messaging me, I won't be here within 24 hours.

Now don't get me wrong, I've met a handful of wonderful people on subreddits that decided to reach out to get to know me instead of playing couch doctor. Unfortunately, the hidden couch doctors on subreddits have outweighed the positives and have left me with a negative outlook, which I can't seem to justify me staying on Reddit, but even if you miss me within 24 hours, you still have options to message me, so it's not like you don't at all. By the way, if you can guess where my username is from, that's going to be totally cool!

Small hint: it's a healing movie shouted in an RPG game. May the odds ever be in your favor to figure things out, and good luck!",2025-04-08 01:15:06+00:00,1,0

1ju1nna,laundry,Bluing liquid turns grey when I add it to washing machine?,"Hi all, I've been trying to use bluing liquid (specifically Mrs. Stewart's) while washing my white towels to keep them white. However, I'm running into an issue where the dye seems to disappear shortly after I add it to the washing machine. I'm not the most experienced person when it comes to laundry, so I apologize in advance for any ""dumb"" questions.

I follow the instructions on the bottle (add some drops of bluing to a quart of water, mix together, and then add this to the wash water). However, the wash water goes from sky-blue to practically colorless quite quickly. I'm not really sure where I'm going wrong, but I have some ideas:

* I wash my towels in hot water. I went to the website for Mrs. Stewart's, but couldn't find any info on whether the dye is destroyed by hot water. Should bluing liquid only be used in cold water?

* My routine for washing my towels is: turn on the washer so it starts filling with water, add detergent, dilute the bluing liquid, add the diluted liquid to the wash water, wait until the wash water turns blue, then add the towels (the water loses its color after a few minutes). My washing machine doesn't seem to have an option to pause the cycle at any point before the end, so I've just been adding the bluing liquid right at the beginning. Am I making a mistake with this?

1ju1nmw,twinflames,Hey read this is so true about the runner and it happened to me,"Hi there, I am a “returning” Runner/Matrix twin. The Runner “returns”/makes contact, turns around, thinks intensely about you when you surrender to the Divine. It’s like as soon as you surrender, we dream of you or feel the energy shift and BAM suddenly you’re all we can think about again. If your Runner is reaching out to you, it’s because they miss you. As runners, we often do not realize we are running from you. We often feel just as ghosted as you do and then eventually decide to be the first one to reach out and break the silence because we miss you. This entire journey is about gaining compassion and empathy for each other and understanding that one side isn’t better or worse than the other… you’re both broken souls who need healing and need a closer relationship with the Divine.


So this person story resonated with my story when my TF  runner “ghosted me” he swore up and down when he came back that I ghosted him. But that wasn’t true and from the story above she said some tf don’t even realized they ghosted you and ran from the connection now I see why my tf wasn’t taking full accountability in his mind he felt like I left him too, that what he told me that  I abandoned him.
Also during our long 10 months no contact he was heavily in my energy. I was told by several ppl that he was missing me and constantly thinking about me 
The reason why I felt him in my energy and it took me to stop fighting the feelings and telling the energy to F off because I seriously was done with him.
His energy was so strong that I just out of nowhere surrendered to the Divine, I said to myself one late night that i miss him unbeknownst to me I was surrendering and guess what y’all my TF felt the energy and finally called a few hours later after I said what I said and surrendered and we was in a long no contact for 10 months 
This is really real, they can really feel our energy.
I’m not going to lie I was scared and shook because at this time I didn’t know we were spiritually connected. I didn’t know too much about TF, until he told me what  it was. 
I was so scared shook and confused that I ended up running lol
Plus, he sent me music that was loud and woke me up out of my sleep.
I still don’t understand how he knows how to do all of these things, but it scared me then I ran for 3 months. I did my researched. I felt him pulling on my energy missing me then I reached out to get clarity and he acted like an A$$hole towards me then we ghosted each other more on his end. I tried, but I’m stubborn I don’t chase after no man.
I think he was mad because how I ran, ran off with another guy and when I came back I wanted clarity on our spiritual connection while he was trying to hook up and wanted to see me. 

What do y’all think? The story really true and resonate and it gave me clarity on my tf connection ",2025-04-08 01:14:38+00:00,1,1

In this Civil War love story, inspired by a real-life friendship across enemy lines, the wife of a missing Confederate soldier discovers a wounded Yankee officer and must decide what she’s willing to risk for the life of a stranger, from the New York Times bestselling author of such acclaimed historical fiction as Hour of the Witch and The Sandcastle Girls.

Virginia, 1864—Libby Steadman’s husband has been away for so long that she can barely conjure his voice in her dreams. While she longs for him in the night, fearing him dead in a Union prison camp, her days are spent running a gristmill with her teenage niece, a hired hand, and his wife, all the grain they can produce requisitioned by the Confederate Army. It’s an uneasy life in the Shenandoah Valley, the territory frequently changing hands, control swinging back and forth like a pendulum between North and South, and Libby awakens every morning expecting to see her land a battlefield.
And then she finds a gravely injured Union officer left for dead in a neighbor’s house, the bones of his hand and leg shattered. Captain Jonathan Weybridge of the Vermont Brigade is her enemy – but he’s also a human being, and Libby must make a terrible Does she leave him to die alone? Or does she risk treason and try to nurse him back to health? And if she succeeds, does she try to secretly bring him across Union lines, where she might negotiate a trade for news of her own husband?
A vivid and sweeping story of two people navigating the boundaries of love and humanity in a landscape of brutal violence, The Jackal’s Mistress is a heart-stopping new novel, based on a largely unknown piece of American history, from one of our greatest storytellers.

1ju1nj5,SCCM,How to get a Package/Program to ignore a non-fatal error?,"I’m trying to run a script that adds print drivers to a live system so that users don’t get prompted for admin creds every time they map a printer. The script works fine, but it returns a non-fatal exit code to indicate that it skipped the 32-bit drivers, which causes SCCM to report a failure in Software Center and in reports.

In the Application model and in task sequences, you can specify non-zero error codes that indicate success to SCCM, but I don’t see this option anywhere with the Package/Program deployment model.

How can I get SCCM to ignore this error code?",2025-04-08 01:14:29+00:00,1,0

1ju1nes,MVIS,Augmenting Reality at Ford Motor,"Microsoft HoloLens fundamentally reshapes operator training at Ford’s Rawsonville Components plant in Ypsilanti, Michigan.

Augmented reality (AR) is one of the most accessible advanced technologies available to manufacturers today. Anyone who’s worn a pair of glasses knows precisely how to use the hardware. But if you order up some AR devices without a plan, you’ll probably only wind up with another toy sitting on a shelf somewhere.

James Massey, senior team leader at Ford’s Rawsonville Components Plant near Detroit, historically doesn’t wear a smile when going about his duties in the shop. So, when Massey says a new technology “makes him giddy,” you know something’s changed for the better on the floor.

Plant Manager Sandy Ilievski kicked off skip-level meetings immediately after taking the reins in late 2023. A key finding: team leaders needed more help for training their operators. Then, last spring, she held a Kaizen event that generated a key question about how to deepen the level of training at the plant.

Ford Motor does run centralized technology groups that develop and promote industry 4.0 innovations. Ford does not, however, push industry 4.0 on plant leaders. They have broad autonomy in choosing which technologies to deploy. Ford instead relies on awareness of successful deployments, such as offering bus tours of plants across the country, to encourage technology adoption.

The company does, however, also support a team specifically to promote AR, a technology with which Ford has enjoyed success. A recent AR application at Ford’s plant in Dearborn, Michigan, for example, allows operators to check wiring harnesses on 2L engines.

Karl Kostrzewa, controls engineer at Rawsonville, had watched promotional videos produced by the AR group and, following the skip meetings and Kaizen event, recognized the opportunity to leverage the technology for training.

Ford’s augmented reality group provided a pair of HoloLens units to the Rawsonville plant. The rest of the project came at plant expense, “an investment in training of our workforce,” says Ilievsky.

Digital Illusions Build Real Muscle Memory

The Rawsonville plant manufactures hybrid and fully electric batteries and components for traditional engines. The first AR-based simulation lab deployed in the battery department.

Operators grew curious when Kostrzewa, Massey, senior process coach Colin Wing, the IT department and others cleared space in the center of the manufacturing floor and set up the new simulation lab shortly after the Kaizen.

A few operators already knew the technology well and owned a few sets personally, Massey says, but the vast majority didn’t know what he meant when he said “VR/AR.”

Kostrzewa might have looked a little out of his mind while wearing the HoloLens glasses and gesticulating in the air at unseen objects as he set up the simulation lab. The technology ceased feeling alien to operators very quickly, however.

A training battery sits in the middle of the simulation lab, where operators familiarize themselves with the battery and receive basic knowledge about bolt guns or other hardware that novices to industrial environments might not recognize.

The operator puts on the HoloLens unit and sees panes projected in their field of view. Setting up panes in Microsoft’s MS Guides cloud-based software feels similar to dragging and dropping content into a PowerPoint deck, says Kostrzewa. Text, graphics or videos may all appear within a pane.

In this case, one pane displays the operator information sheet (OIS) for the station, including the order of tasks. Arrows projected in AR hover over the bolts to run down.

The traditional way of doing it, we read the OIS, JSA (job safety analysis)…the critical to quality items, why it’s so critical… it’s all verbal,” Ilievsky says. “Then they go on-line. [With the HoloLens training] we’re now eliminating that first three-to-four times where the person’s trying to get used to it, by [training] off-line. … By the time they get to on-line ready, they already have that muscle memory. They know exactly what they’re doing.”

Massey adds, “About 30% of my people have been trained on the [simulation lab]. Every one of them loves it. They feel better when they get to the line. … They’re more relaxed. And the majority of them are within cycle within three or four parts.”

How does that compare to how quickly new operators get within cycle using traditional, pre-HoloLens training?

“Old school training, with me standing there showing them? They get three days, contractually,” Massey laughs.

All jokes aside, not having to stand over the shoulder of every new operator during training takes the pressure off Massey, as well. Now, instead of supervising a single station during training, Massey divides his time between all the leaders on the floor as he usually does, even with a brand-new operator on the line.

Hence the smile.

The Rawsonville plant now additionally uses HoloLens-based training on the plant’s carbon canister manufacturing line and in the material planning and logistics department, with further expansions planned in the immediate future.
Augmenting Awareness to Increase Innovation

The first bus tour of the Rawsonville plant that showed off the simulation lab took place in August 2024. According to Ilievski, leaders from other Ford plants have since continued returning to Rawsonville to learn more about the training program.

She makes it clear to visiting plant leaders that while augmented reality technology does play the starring role in Rawsonville’s simulation lab, it’s just part of the puzzle. The maintenance group, production teams and IT department all had to get involved to make the project work.

You can’t just order up a few HoloLens units and expect innovation to follow. That way lies pilot purgatory. You need an obvious pain point and a clear plan. Technology, even something as awesome as augmented reality, is always just a tool.",2025-04-08 01:14:18+00:00,1,0
1ju1ne8,PorscheCayenne,Looking at Buying a 2008 Cayenne Turbo – Would Love Your Thoughts!b,"I’m thinking about buying an original owner 2008 Cayenne Turbo and would love to hear your thoughts on it. It’s listed for $8,500 (I offered $6,500), and I’m really into it. Owner has been nice to deal with. It’s got a unique paint color that I’ve never seen on a Cayenne before—kind of a deep metallic purple/navy blue. 

Here’s what I know about the car:

	•	Mileage: Around 230,000 km
	•	Recent work done: Coolant lines replaced, new starter, new brake pads (but needs new rotors), and tires with some life left (winter tires on 21” rims included)
	•	Issues:
	•	Passenger-side catalytic converter needs replacing (it’s throwing a few codes)
	•	Runs a little off, but no lack of power
	•	Mechanics recommend sticking to local driving until the converter’s fixed

A bit about me: I’m really into car mechanics and have worked on my own vehicles before (spark plugs, alternators, belts, struts, and all kinds of fluids). I always baby my cars, and my previous Lincoln Navigator’s paint was always waxed and the leather conditioned. I pride myself on keeping my cars in great shape and running well.

I’m planning on using this for my family (wife, daughter, and me) for local driving mostly. I’m just making sure it’s a good deal and not a money pit. I’ve always wanted a Cayenne, so I’m hoping this one works out!

I’m going to get a pre-purchase inspection done. Besides that, anything else I should look out for? And what’s the deal with that color?

Appreciate any thoughts! I’ve included photos from the listing. ",2025-04-08 01:14:16+00:00,1,0
1ju1nbd,NoMansSkyTheGame,Building up my Frigates?,"I've tried searching and it's hard to get simple answers. I'm still quite new to frigate expeditions, it's one of those things I just ignored for a long time even though I have multiple expedition terminals. 

Currently I have the Normandy, Ship of the Damned, and one other S. Then some random C and now B Class frigates after a decent handful of expeditions. 

I recently got my first living frigate and I've read up on how to get more.

I've always heard the frigate expeditions can be very lucrative, causing players to quickly reach the unit cap. I'm not really even trying to do that.

I know 3 star missions are the max. I only ever see 3 hour or less missions. 1500 to 2000 light years at most. 

A typical rewards haul is less than a million units (350k-800k) maybe some Vy'keen effigies, some rare metals and that's mostly it.

Does a fleet of around 15 mostly low level frigates really increase rewards that much by building up to 30 S Class?

I don't actually know what I'm doing. I mostly just pick a mix of frigates and make sure the rating is higher than the difficulty. I've never run out of fuel or had to make repairs to a frigate. So far I've only had one prompt mid-mission which was an investment opportunity. 

Any info is appreciated. TIA!",2025-04-08 01:14:11+00:00,1,1

1ju1n9f,diablo4,Old D2/WoW BC player starting D4 for the first time. Class rec/overall advice.,"Hey all, I’m sure this gets posted all the time. If there’s one similar to this please let me know but here’s a little background:

I played D2/LOD back in the day 2003-2008ish and eventually got really into the game. Plaid the game pretty heavy (had no responsibilities etc) got all the best runed gear, etc. 

I then went to play WoW and played until about a year into BC. I leveled 2 characters to max and only did end game raiding once. I ran MC with my Shammy and got my one and only Epic wristbands lol. Loved PVP, WSG, AV AB etc. 

I played D3 super casually on my console with a few buddies for a few months and that was about it. 

I downloaded the re-release of D2 a few years back on console, never played it, until just now and leveled necromancy to level 14. It was a huge rush of nostalgia and overall super fun. Started doing trust runs by myself and just having a good ol’ time. 

It got me to the point where I want to buy D4 and play on a semi casual level. I’m 32 and have a FT job but I’m recently single and have no kids etc. 

I guess my ultimate question is, are there any classes that stand out more than others currently? Is there a lot of end game? Is the game as depth as WoW? I know WoW end game has always been crazy, but what is it like for D4? How’s the PVP? I should watch some YouTube videos but I thought I’d ask here as well.

1ju1n7t,CarTalkUK,Advice needed on car swap,"I’m in a bit of a dilemma and could use some honest advice. I currently have a 2007 BMW 318i SE 2.0 petrol engine 126k miles that I bought off a friend for about 1.4K , so I know it’s in good shape overall. I really enjoyed driving it the couple of times I drove it but it’s sorned right now as I’m waiting for my insurance to start, however I’m increasingly worried about the maintenance and ongoing costs like repairs, parts, and services that a bmw would need eventually—not to mention the issues with resale value and market demand when it comes time to sell it.

Now, someone has offered me a direct swap for a VW Polo 2010 3dr 1.4 (85 bhp) 128k miles on marketplace. On paper, the Polo would be cheaper to run day-to-day, which would definitely help with my tight uni budget as the fuel consumption is obviously lower along with lower tax and insurance saving me about £700 in total without considering fuel. However, there’s one small issue, the Polo has a problem with the passenger window, which would need fixing and I’m guessing that’s an easy fix. I’m not 100% sure about the overall condition of the Polo since I don’t know the owner’s history as well as I do my BMW’s, and that makes me a bit nervous about swapping even though the owner seems like a safe guy but one can never be too sure.

What do you all think? Is it worth trading my BMW for a Polo even with the window issue, considering my concerns about reliability, maintenance, service costs, and potential resale value? Any advice would be really appreciated as this is my first car and I’m worried about the resale value as well, as I might consider selling the car as a whole as I recently have been unemployed.

i am a POC, first gen, low income senior from an illinois HS in the burbs (think naperville). i have probably been interested in becoming a software engineer since like the 7th or 8th grade. now that i've been accepted to these schools, i am running into this problem.

because of my low income, madison is giving me a full ride. u of i is only around ~10k a year after merit. i'm currently working to be changed to the iPromise so i can also have a full ride, which i'm like 99% sure will be the case. however i want to commit before i get a response.

my thinking for u of i is that a lot of people from my high school are going there (we feed at least 10-15 kids a year) so i won't feel completely isolated compared to basically no one i know planning on going to madison. it doesn't help knowing about the rumors of it being snobby or lacking diversity. i can also declare computer engineering out of the engineering undeclared program (at u of i), which i think might be able to outweigh madison's cs. i am also worried about madison's cs being too oversaturated.

at the same time, you could argue that i can't bet on going into compeng. you might say that cs aligns me the most with my goals, so i should go to UW-mad. you could also say that the fact that i have a guaranteed full ride is better than assuming i will get more money from u of i. you could also argue that the location and social scene is better (social scene i might care about, location not so much).

i'm just hoping to get some advice from other people. my gut was swaying towards illinois but something about it today just didn't feel right to say for certain.

Why does the dad allow the children to spend so much time with Lucy knowing what they're exposed to ? 
I haven't heard anything about court orders so I can only make assumptions here but - 
If there are no court orders then legally he does not have to provide her with access. 
If there are court orders why would he not seek to have them varied to have conditions such as she must only be allowed access if it takes place in a home with running water/ toilet facilities etc. 
Again I'm making an assumption that he probably wants to ensure the children do see their mother but surely he could safeguard them better ? From what I've seen he's aware of her tt so he knows the food provided doesn't get used etc surely at some point you would seek legal conditions ?

1ju1lsm,hvacadvice,New boiler heating zones that are off,"Recently had a new boiler installed and I'm happy with it overall. The problem is, the boiler runs 3 zones of heat and also runs an indirect water heater. Even when none of my thermostats are calling for heat, the boiler will still fire to satisfy the hot water heater and somehow the hot water works its way up the returns from my heating zones and I end up with an 80 degree house. This is a problem primarily on the 1st floor. 

The installing company has been very good about sending a crew out to fix the issue, but we've tried twice to no avail and I'd like to have a plan in place before I take the time out of my day and theirs to get it fixed. 

The new setup differs from my old setup in that they installed it with a balancing valve connecting the supply and returns. I'm not 100% sure why this is necessary, but I was told the boiler would go into lock-out if it were closed. The system is running on the internal circulator of the boiler and the heating zones and hot water heater each have a zone valve. The old setup had no connection to balance the supply and return side and we never had this problem.

 The first time they came out, they opened this valve a little more, I assume in an effort to decrease the pressure differential. The second time, they replaced a head on the zone valve for my first floor heat thinking it could somehow be stuck slightly open allowing the reverse flow.

I asked about potentially adding check valves in the return lines, but they said this would be too restrictive. I'm not really seeing another solution, as the hot water must be travelling up the return by convection or cooler water flowing down by gravity. I also thought there may be a better solution to balancing than a half-cracked ball valve.

Note in the pictures, I've closed the valves to the heating zones at this point to maintain a comfortable temperature in the house.

If anyone has any thoughts or suggestions, it would be appreciated. Thanks.

1ju1lrw,pregnant,Can’t even wash dishes now 🥲,"My nausea has really started to set-in this last week and it just hit a new low. Washing dishes has been a little bit of a problem for me since it started up, but not so much to the point where I couldn’t finish, or at least mostly finish, cleaning dishes.

My husband (29) and I (27) are looking for a party resort in Cancun to travel to in Maythat isn't too run down, has edible food, and decent alcohol that won't give us crazy hangovers.

We are currently prioritizing staying in the Hotel Zone, but Riu Caribe seems to have a lot of parties and is newly renovated so it's not out of the running for us. The 5 days at a Riu hotels are a bit of a commitment for us, and we're not sure if the higher price point at a Breathless resort is worth it (I saw some reviews saying that the music is the same every night and the hotel is understaffed).

I would go used but there still $45k with 30k miles which is stupid. Along with that if I sadly can’t get a new Type R in time do you guys have any suggestions.

I can't decide what the Meteorologist should sense. My gut says evil player, but I fear it may be too powerful.

""Each night, if you didn't choose a \[Evil player/Minion/Demon\] last night, choose a player.""

Each night:

* If there isn't a **Don't Wake** reminder token on the Meteorologist: Wake them up and have them choose a player
   * If the player is \[Evil/Minion/Demon\], place the **Don't Wake** reminder token on the Meteorologist
* If there is a **Don't Wake** reminder token on the Meteorologist: Don't wake the Meteorologist and remove the **Don't Wake** reminder token.
* If the Meteorologist is **drunk** or **poisoned**: Remove the **Don't Wake** reminder token, if any, and choose to wake or not wake the Meteorologist (suggest you do the opposite of what you would do if sober/healthy).

1ju1l7g,venetiansnares,Weekly Album Discussion #10: Chocolate Wheelchair Album,"*No Herbie, don't do it!*

Hello and welcome back r/venetiansnares, to our newest album discussion! This week we're talking about *[The Chocolate Wheelchair Album](https://venetiansnares.bandcamp.com/album/the-chocolate-wheelchair-album)*! It was released by Planet Mu on Oct 20, 2003. Though listed as *The Chocolate Wheelchair Album* on the Planet Mu website, the album title is not listed anywhere on the album, booklet, sleeve, etc.

[Pitchfork's review](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8441-the-chocolate-wheelchair-album/) notes:
>Rumor has it that Funk's original title for this album was The Stupid Chocolate Wheelchair Album, an idea quashed by a disapproving Paradinas. That didn't stop Funk taking a black marker to pre-release copies distributed at promotional gigs last year and ""correcting"" the tamed album title.

I'm not sure what perception of this album was like upon release, but I'd say it's certainly grown to become a fan favorite in the years since its release.

From Planet Mu:
>Aaron Funk delivers once again for Planet Mu. For those who enjoyed ""Higgins Ultra Low Track Glue Funk Hits 1972-2006"" - this is the stylistic follow-up - full-on punk-rave jungle breaks with lots and lots of pop attitude in 7/8 (and 5/4). As well as the classic single: ""Einstein-Rosen Bridge"" with its funk guitar, sci-fi vocals and salsa trumpets, the album is also choc-full (ho) of other delights. Such as the shouty post-punk vocal hooks of ""Abomination Street"" whose melody is based on the TV theme of a well known & long-running Manchester soap opera, or Too Young - a glitch-hop reworking of the Motley Crue hit. ""Hand Throw"" - in which a gruff (Belgian) MC shouts out to ""Antwerp massive""... or ""Epidermis"" in which another more tremulous post-punk chanteuse pairs up with spooky drexciyan chords, titanium breaks and a buzzing reese bass. The album concludes with Aaron's most daring deconstruction of the amen break yet - ""Herbie Goes Ballistic"" with a guest performance from the little VW beetle who cared.

So, what do you guys think of *The Chocolate Wheelchair Album*? Do you have a favorite track? Least favorite? Favorite sample? Would you eat that chocolate wheelchair on the cover if you could?

...and next week we'll be talking about *Horse and Goat* (I think)",2025-04-08 01:11:09+00:00,2,0

Ilang company allegedly bought beachfront property. Before, people and vehicles could pass through freely. Karon, gitukoran og taas nga concrete wall, and sa area nga bawal tukoran (near the white sand where high tide reaches), gibutangan nalang og closely packed bamboo cottages para murag fence gihapon. Gi-block gyud ang agi, even if the lot inside is still vacant.

Under the Water Code, there should be a public easement from the highest tide line: 3m (urban), 20m (agricultural), 40m (forest)

1ju1ksw,Helldivers,"Since the First Expedition into the Gloom was quite scary, here's one that's more Terrifying.","Veil of Shadows event.

Background, why the heck are there freaking Flying Bile Titans: Some time during the Second Galactic War, the Illuminids thought of a Genius plan, to enslave the Terminids and use then to crush Super Earth and the walking Trash(the Automatons), they created a substance called the ""Veil Fluid""(roughtly the same stuff that is used to create Voteless) and put them in Canisters. After flying to a planet in the [REDACTED] sector, they yeeted the Canisters from Orbit, most of the Canisters remain relatively unscathed, all except for that one Canister that crashed into a Bile Titan, resulting in terrifying mutations that quickly spread to the Planet's core(Phase 1, during this stage, Helldivers still encounter regular Terminids, however there is a 0,1% chance of either encountering the Mutated Bile Titan or Illuminate Ships). After Super Earth and the Helldivers try to save the planet(Phase 2 of the Operation), the Sentient Core began to replicate the entire planet(like how a Bacteria duplicates itself), forcing the Helldivers to do something about it(Destroy It)(the Final Phase)

Random Events:

-Veil Rebirth: A Random Biological Slurry Mass will Explode releasing smaller Terminids.

-Bioluminescent Eclipse: Temporary darkness where only sample glow lights the way.(If this event happens, all players on the planet will encounter this event)

-Tectonic Movement: Earthquake

-Firestorm(SP): Large amounts of trees burned combined with heavy winds create a Storm of Fire.

-Ash Cyclones(SP): A Cyclone will pick up Ash and Ember, limiting vision and will make random stuff(not Helldivers) on fire.

-Emberfields(SP)(A Direct result of the Ash Cyclone): As the Ember settle, it starts burning dry vegetation, creating a mini Firestorm.

-Data Degradation(Data Collection missions): Every 10 minutes, Data nodes will lose 5% integrity, only happens when it's ON the Helldiver.

Environmental Hazards:

-Electrical Surge: The Terrain will randomly emit Surges of Electricity, damaging or killing anything contacted.(Electrical Conduits will reduce damage, Arc-based weapons will have 25% more range and damage)

-Shifting Gravity: Gravity will fluctuate(Either higher Gravity(Slower movement, less jump height) or lower Gravity(Higher Jump height) and even cause Helldivers to float. It will also affect how bullets and bile fly.

-Reality Distortion Zone: Helldivers will sometimes encounter “Mirages” of Terminids and sometimes even SEAF troops and other Helldivers.

-Unstable Terrain: The Ground will sometimes shift, resulting in cracks in the earth and Bug Breaches(25% more likely to happen).

-Luminescent Lure: Fake Bioluminescent Samples that will Explode when picked up, releasing spore clouds that slightly damage the Helldiver.

Enemies:

-Bile Shrieker(not to be confused with the other fanmade Terminid): A Bile Titan + Shrieker, flies and spits bile, larger than a conventional Bile Titan and is more aggressive.

-Unbraclops(names will be changed): A Special Stalker breed, only moves when not observed, can't pounce.

-Black Berserk: A Larger, more Aggressive Charger that leaves black flames in it's path.

-Veil Titan: Basicly a Larger Bile Titan, spews Black Bile(deals alot more damage)

-Scorched Protocol(SP): Helldivers active and Defend a Incendiary Probes to burn away the Veil Flora(best takes place in a Forest map), this attracts Terminids. When the fire's burning, it will create the Environmental Hazards stated above, and will spread across the ENTIRE map.

-Kill _ Terminids

-Blacklight Harvest: Collect Bioluminescent Samples from Veil Terminid Hives. It glows and attracts a lot of bugs, the more the Helldiver carries, the Larger the bug.

-Geyser Blockage: Use heavy explosives to close or collapse Geysers, might cause a Bug Breach.

# Chapter 1: Bittersweet Memories

Tiana’s POV

I was running around the house, trying to get everything sorted out on time. I haven't been given a minute of rest since I started working in the morning, and today is hectic for me; it doesn't seem to be getting better, rather it's getting worse.

“Tiana!” my father screamed my name.

I flinched, making all the breakable plates I held fall to the ground. I was only going to be in more trouble now that all these things were broken. I tried using anything I could find to cover it, but it was already too late since he had seen it.

“You bastard.” Smack. The sharp sting of my father's hand across my face made my eyes water and my cheeks burn. I flinched, even though I had known it was coming.

“Were you sent by the gods to ruin my life? Do you have to do everything to infuriate me? You are nothing but a filthy human.” His voice was harsh and his eyes gleamed with hatred as he stared at me, daring me to move. I stayed still, fighting back the tears that threatened to fall. It wasn't the first time that he's been insulting me, and I was already used to it.

“Clean that up quickly and go prepare breakfast.”

I nodded in response and started picking the plates up and dropping them inside a trash can nearby. I could see my stepsister, Selene, in the background, with a smirk on her face. The truth is, Father doesn't really need a reason to punish me. He relished in my pain and took every opportunity he could to hurt me. He hissed and walked away with Selene, leaving me alone in the kitchen.

It wasn't always like this, though. Once upon a time, when I was a little girl, my father adored and treated me like a little princess. He and my mother doted on me, and I basked in the love they gave me and my brother. As the younger one, I received far more attention than Viktor, my brother, but he never seemed to mind. Viktor is four years older than me.

So naturally he felt like he was more mature. Life was like a fairy tale, but eventually, my life changed for the worse, and it was by my own doing, even though I had never intended for it to happen. I was still young and naive, but that didn't deter my father at all. In his mind, I was the one responsible for his life falling apart, even though he got married to Rhona, Selene’s mother, a year later. The sad thing is, I believe it wholeheartedly too. If it wasn't for me, our family would still be together.

**Flashback**

It was on my eighth birthday. It was a nice and sunny day outside on that particular day. I have been stuck inside the house with my mom for most of the day while my brother has gone out with my dad for training. I was already bored as my mom was busy with the house chores and all the things that needed to be done in the house, but I wanted to go outside with her to get some candy for my birthday. I was pouting.

“Don't pout Tiana,” my mother chided, coming into the sitting room and putting her hands on her hips. “I'm sorry you've had to wait so long, but I'm all done now. Why don't we go outside for a walk? And also get you some candy.”

I instantly brightened up, and my mother laughed. My mother was very beautiful; she had the face of an angel and brunette hair, unlike me, who had blonde hair. Her eyes twinkled as she watched me run to get my coat. I made a dash for the door and excitedly opened it, running outside as my mother hastened to keep up.

We set out for the nearest candy store that also had a playground for kids. When we got there, I spotted a group of children playing, including Sheila the Alpha's daughter. I had a crush on her brother, Derek, so I would usually try to play with her whenever I could in order to get closer to her and see Derek more often, even though I knew he was mostly busy with training, just like my brother.

Sheila smiled at me as I approached. “Hey Tiana, do you want to play hide and seek with us?” She asked, still smiling at me.

“Yes,” I squealed as my mother laughed behind me. “Count me in.” My mother smiled as she walked away to the candy shop. She looked calm and relaxed as she sat down on the sidelines, watching us as we played.

We all ran off to hide as Selene, who is now my stepsister, began to count. I giggled as I ran into the tall bushes and tumbleweeds opposite the candy shop to hide. It was an open field behind the bushes and tumbleweeds, but it was enough to keep me hidden. I was able to see whoever was approaching me and to keep myself hidden, I could also navigate from one tumbleweed to the other to stay hidden.

I could hear her finish counting “98, 99, 100,” she shouted in the distance, and I waited with anticipation. I was sure I'd be the last to be found, so I sat down behind a tumbleweed, staring into the vast open field, and waiting for Selene to come find me. As I stared into the field, I noticed something running towards me. I squinted my eyes to get a better look, then I realized it looked to be some dog or coyote in the distance.

Then the sudden smell of something rotten permeated my nostrils. I swallowed, feeling sick. We were taught from a very young age what that smell meant.

“Rogues!” I cried out.

I stumbled backwards, trying to get up as fast as I could, and started running as fast as my legs could carry me towards my mother. While running, my foot got stuck in a small hole. I cried out as I looked back and noticed more swarms of rogues on the field. They were so many! I saw Sheila and the other children running away to the bunkers.

My mother shifted into her grey wolf and pounded towards me. I got my leg free and stumbled backwards. The sound of a threatening growl made me turn around slowly, and I came face to face with a massive rogue that smelt like sewage.

Drool was dropping from the rogue’s lips. It reared back on its hind legs, ready to pounce on me, but right before it did, my mother's grey wolf leapt over me and tackled the rogue. I felt my heart skip.

“Mom!” I cried out. I stood to my feet as I watched her battle the rogue valiantly. Then another wolf grabbed me and started dragging me away from the scene. I turned to see the familiar wolf; it was Rachael, my mother's best friend.

She returned to her human form. ""Tiana, you need to run.” She said and started shoving me away, but I didn't want to budge. This was my mother, and I was too young and naive to comprehend that I was a hindrance rather than a help to her.

At first, it seemed like my mother would be fine; she was even able to beat the rogue. My heart skipped as three more rogues joined, surrounding my mother. It all happened in slow motion as the three rogues jumped in sync on my mother, ripping and tearing her to pieces. I remember screaming over and over again as my mother’s blood spurted everywhere. The rogues showed no mercy. Tears streamed down my face as my whole body shook in fear. It felt like I was paralyzed.

Rachael, who had been watching with me, picked me up and ran with me back to the safe room in the bunker. Tears trailed down my cheeks.

After the rogues had been defeated that evening, Rachael decided to take me home and to also explain everything to my dad. We found my dad and Viktor outside, nervously waiting for me and my mother to return. They ran towards us when they spotted us, and Rachael handed me over to Viktor to take me inside while she spoke with my father. Viktor took me in with a scared look on his face, “Where is mom?” He asked, upset.

I shook my head, unable to speak. He gasped, and tears began running down his cheek.

“It's your fault,” whispered Viktor as I turned to him in shock. “Mom would still be here with us today and would not have died if you had not forced her to take you out today despite Dad's warnings.”

I hated myself at that moment as I thought about it; if I hadn't forced her to go out in the first place, she would still be alive, and if she hadn't tried to save me, maybe she wouldn't have died. I sobbed, my heartbroken, as I thought of how I had caused my own mother’s death.

# Electric kettle vs. Kettle & Warmer 2025: Efficiency Showdown - Which saves You Money?

In the realm of commercial kitchens, offices, and shared spaces, the seemingly simple task of heating water can have a surprising impact on your bottom line. Whether it's for brewing that perfect cup of coffee, preparing tea for a team, or creating instant soups and noodles, the method you choose to heat water matters. Two popular contenders for this task are the electric kettle and the kettle and warmer combination. But which option truly comes out on top when it comes to efficiency and long-term cost savings? Let's dive deep into the electric kettle vs kettle and warmer efficiency differences to uncover the truth.

[[Explore Top Rated electric kettle vs kettle and warmer efficiency differences on Amazon.]](https://wabashop.com/travel-gifts-7/?kw=%%keyword%)
## Understanding the Contenders: Electric kettles and Kettle Warmers

Before we can compare, it's essential to understand what these appliances are and how they work.

**Electric Kettles:** These self-contained units rapidly heat water using an internal heating element. They're known for their speed and convenience,automatically shutting off once the water boils. The ""best commercial electric kettle,"" as many users search, is one that balances capacity, durability, and energy efficiency. Different wattage electric kettles will affect boiling time, with models offering faster boiling at the expense of higher energy demands and vice versa.

**Kettle and Warmer Combinations:** This approach involves boiling water separately,which is then poured into a kettle that sits on a warming plate. The warming plate maintains the water temperature,keeping it hot and ready for dispensing. While they offer convenience, the persistent warmer functionality has notable energy implications.

[[Explore Top Rated electric kettle vs kettle and warmer efficiency differences on Amazon.]](https://wabashop.com/travel-gifts-7/?kw=%%keyword%)
## The Efficiency Showdown: Breaking Down the Numbers

The crux of the matter lies in the energy consumption of each method. Let's look at the factors affecting the ""electric kettle energy consumption"" and ""kettle warmer power consumption.""

### Electric Kettle Efficiency: Targeted Heating

Electric kettles excel in efficiency as they heat water directly. All power is used to bring water to boil. How efficient is it? When looking at electric kettle vs stovetop kettle efficiency, most studies clearly show the electric kettle wins.This is because you are directly heating the water versus applying heat to a pot, which then heats the water within.

Factors influencing electric kettle energy consumption include:

*   **Wattage:** Higher wattage kettles boil water faster but draw more power.*   **Volume of Water:** Heating a full kettle consumes more energy than heating only the needed amount.
*   **initial Water Temperature:** starting with cooler water naturally requires more energy to reach boiling point.

### Kettle Warmer Inefficiency: constant Energy Output

The main drawback of kettle warmers is their continual energy usage. The ""kettle warmer power consumption"" never stops as long as the warmer is engaged. While it may seem convenient, think about this:

*   **Maintaining Temperature:** A kettle warmer continuously consumes power to maintain the water's temperature, even if no one is using the kettle. This ""trickle"" feed of energy adds up significantly over hours or days.
*   **Heat Loss:** Kettles on warmers are prone to heat loss, meaning the warming plate needs to work even harder to compensate, further increasing energy consumption.
*   **Evaporation:** The continuous heating from a warming plate can lead to water evaporation, requiring refills and additional boiling cycles.

### Quantifying the Cost: ""Cost to Boil Water with Electric Kettle""

To truly grasp the difference, let's consider the actual cost. You can calculate the cost to boil water with electric kettle. Assume a standard electric kettle uses 1500W (1.5kW).Boiling one liter of water might take approximately 3 minutes (0.05 hours). This means one boiling cycle consumes approximately 0.075 kWh of energy (1.5 kW * 0.05 hours). The cost per boil depends on your electricity rate. If electricity costs $0.20 per kWh, each boil costs $0.015.

While this seems minimal, consider a commercial setting needing numerous boils daily. The collective cost is easily managed and predictable with an electric kettle.

In contrast, a kettle warmer might only use 50W but runs constantly for hours. Over an 8-hour workday, this equates to 0.4 kWh of energy consumption per day. at the same $0.20 per kWh rate,it costs $0.08 per day. Although this is a higher initial cost, it fails in comparison to a high volume of kettle boils.### Beyond Boiling: Considering the Larger Impact – Energy Efficient Hot Water Solutions

When comparing energy efficient hot water solutions, and not boiling specifically, kettle warmers falter even further. The only exception where a kettle warmer maybe slightly better is if you only need a very minor amount of hot water throughout the day.

## targeting Specific User Needs: Catering to Our Audience

Now, let's tailor this comparison to the specific needs of our target audience:

**Office Managers:** For office managers, the priority is ""cost-effective solutions for providing hot water to employees."" They need to consider energy bills, maintenance, and the convenience of having hot water readily available. The long term cost of electric kettle is much easier to control versus a warmer plate. Given the frequency of use in an office setting, the electric kettle is the most fiscally responsible choice. Electric kettles easily manage the needs for light volume and high boil frequency.

**Cafe/Restaurant Owners:** For cafe and restaurant owners, the criteria are slightly different.They require ""reliable and efficient water heating for brewing coffee/tea,"" with a focus on speed, capacity, and operational costs. While speed becomes a factor,the commercial coffee maker energy consumption also needs consideration.While a warmer is out of the question for this set, exploring a water boiler vs kettle energy consumption becomes important. Water boilers are typically used for high-volume needs.

**Building Managers:** Building managers prioritize ""enduring and energy-efficient equipment for shared spaces."" They must adhere to environmental regulations while minimizing operational expenses. Here, the electric kettle's on-demand heating and ability to shut off automatically once boiling makes it very suitable for eco-friendly practices.

**Purchasing Agents:** Purchasing agents focus on ""making informed decisions about purchasing in bulk."" They prioritize specifications, maintenance costs, and quality of goods. The simplicity of the electric kettle translates to both lower purchase costs and lower maintenance, making it the best solution.

## Choosing the Right Kettle: Factors to Consider

If an electric kettle is the right choice for you, here are factors to consider when searching for the ""best commercial electric kettle"":

*   **Capacity:** Select a capacity that aligns with your typical usage. Overly large kettles waste energy by heating unneeded water.*   **Wattage:** Balance speed with energy consumption. Higher wattage means faster boiling, but also higher energy usage. Consider looking into an electric kettle wattage vs boiling time.
*   **Material:** Stainless steel is durable and hygienic, making it ideal for commercial settings.
*   **Features:** Look for automatic shut-off, boil-dry protection, and cool-touch exteriors for safety and convenience.
*   **Brand Reputation:** Research reputable brands known for their quality and reliability.

## Conclusion: Efficiency and Savings – The Electric Kettle wins

In the electric kettle vs kettle and warmer efficiency differences discussion, the electric kettle stands out as the more efficient and cost-effective solution for most commercial settings.While kettle warmers may appear convenient initially, their constant energy consumption leads to significant long-term costs.

The electric kettle's on-demand heating, targeted energy usage, and automatic shut-off mechanism make it a champion of energy efficiency. By carefully considering the variables discussed and matching the appropriate kettle features to your needs, you can effectively minimize energy waste and save money. Especially when considering ""energy efficient hot water solutions,"" electric kettles are the smart choice.This, in turn, helps to create a more sustainable and financially responsible operation.Ultimately, by making an informed decision between the electric kettle and warmer, you equip yourself with an efficient solution that benefits both your bottom line and the surroundings, securing a smart investment for 2025 and beyond.

1ju1khu,radeon,Tiniest bit of PL increase makes 9070xt crash,"I'm very happy with my 9070xt Red Devil, and I do realize I don't even need to increase the power limit for any realistic use case. (I only game casually.)

Still, I'm a bit bothered (FOMO?) when I see other folks post their Steel Nomad results with +10 PL in combination with undervolts and high VRAM freqs.

I can get good results with -80mV and 2800MHz VRAM fast timing, but if I raise the PL by +2 it already black screens half way through the Steel Nomad benchmark.

What could be factors influencing the (in)stability under high power limits? Also, what are the best ways of investigating this? Run HWinfo logs probably, but what are things to look out for?

- MOBO: MSI B550m PRO-VDH

Also if you're in this group, don't read this obviously. I can only think of 1 person who might stumble upon this but, Wendell look away.

I've been running the game since 2016 so I feel confident in my abilities and the basics, but I could use some help brainstorming.

Basically I'm running a mini campaign for 8 friends where I split them up into 2 groups of 4 and give each of them 1 of 4 characters I made. At the end of every session, the players jump back to wherever the previous group left off with no memory of it. Also each group speaks a different language (celestial and infernal respectively) so the only way they could communicate is through drawing pictures as notes.

I have a lot of the story planned out but I'm trying to fill in more detail if possible and I'm looking for some potential puzzles that use the swapping mechanic? Maybe 1 group has to find information that the other group has to use and they have to find creative ways of communicating that? Maybe one group is warned of a danger that will face the other?

For more context if its helpful: The PCs (but in the life the players don't remember) summoned a bunch of demons to create a cave to hold themselves and a nearby town safe from the rapture (but way more eldritch) happening outside.

1ju1kbv,marvelrivals,Spiderman: Hero or Menace,"Disclaimer: Spiderman is not a uncounterable, unbeatable or poorly designed character. This is merely a discussion about his gameplay, what is required to play him and if his loop is healthy enough to never be reworked or tweaked slightly. 

Spiderman may very well be one of the best designed characters in a shooter game, in terms of feeling like Spiderman. The designers really nailed the web swinging, the elusiveness and the hit and run nature of a beloved character. Marvel rivals balance is overall pretty solid and given how new the game is, the devs have been quick to throw balance adjustments around when needed to where most of the cast is pretty fun and viable. Assassins are always the hardest to find the perfect balance and Spiderman is one of the prime examples. 

I'm older. Most of what I mention is focused on the casual side, because that's how I consider myself even though I've played games and shooter games for a very long time. Spiderman is a character that on the surface seems pretty straight forward like most of the cast, you check his abilities and off you go. It quickly becomes apparent that even though you understand the basic flow of his kit, it feels like something is missing. Optimization and animation canceling is crucial to this character, and to me so far, this is the only character in the game that requires you watch a Spiderman guide video to learn how to actually play Spiderman. 

If you're familiar with league of legends, it immediately made me think of Riven. Similarly, you can casually understand the kit, play against some weaker players and do fine. But as soon as you start playing against people who are better, your impact falls off a cliff. The guide doesn't automatically make you a better player, but it start to fill in the gaps that were missing before. Maybe practice a little on the training dummies but to really test you have to play against real people. Que to QP. 

I think most people know that QP matchmaking is terrible and very rarely do you get a good, even back and forth match. Most matches are a stomp or get stomped situation. But one thing I can say happens almost every game is Spiderman is flamed more than any other character. You cannot attempt to play Spiderman against and not get shit talked by your team and the enemy team, even if you tried to make the right fights. Thick skin, mute, ignore, sure you can do all of that but it still doesn't feel great when you can put in less effort learning a different character, still lose, but have higher damage and not get flamed. Black panther and Spiderman both have a very simple counter, Strategists that are pretty decent at the game. 

Spiderman is an annoyance, but all the healers need to do is just toss a heal on each other and spidys kill combo is nullified. Similar to most black panthers, a couple stray heals is all it takes and that's not taking into account all the other parts of the healers kits. Healers are the backbone of this game, and it seems the devs plan to keep it that way, at least for the time being. But if you're playing with teammates who aren't very good at playing heals, it feels awful to play against. One spidy cluster with an e-f combo is enough to almost oneshot a healer and if your healing buddy doesn't have your back, it feels not the best. Plenty of the other cast can be oppressive too, but I think they feel more manageable due to how much easier they are to hit. 

Again, I'm old but my aim is okay. It's pretty hard to hit a decent Spiderman, but it changes from who you're playing. Half the cast really can't hit him, but if your aim is true some are perfect for gunning him down. Play against people who can't aim well, and healers who don't play off each other and an average Spiderman will warp the match. Play against a mantis and luna with good aim on their cc, or a hela and your decent Spiderman is basically just an ult bot with not much of a way to impact the game. 

There's plenty of other parts that can be discussed, but my own opinion on the matter is that for how great Spiderman is from a design and even gameplay pov, he suffers and will probably continue to due so as more anti dive and cc options are added to the game. On the higher end, he's not as oppressive and teams with better aim and communication can limit his effectiveness greatly. Against casual or players who are not as good, a great Spiderman runs the lobby and is enough to make people quit the game. People flame the Spiderman player for killing the healers, people flame the Spiderman if you're in the process of learning him and your team loses. You probably get flamed by the enemy team in the process too. 

I don't really know what they could change, or even if they should change anything. But I stand on that you shouldn't have to watch a YouTube video to actually be able to play the character. And also that Spiderman win or lose should not get flamed every single game. Marvel rivals is super fun and I hope they can avoid more issues like this in future character releases.

1ju1kaw,AusRenovation,Outside is now inside,"Have this strange little section of our house where the laundry used to be accessed from outside.

* Ignoring their **website** (or not having one at all)
* No tracking, no analytics, no idea what’s working

That’s not digital marketing—that’s gambling.

# So What Actually Works?

Here’s what we’ve learned from real businesses we’ve helped grow through **Malafaat**:

✅ **Content that solves problems**  
People in Egypt are searching Google every day for answers. If your business creates valuable content (blog posts, videos, how-tos, guides), you build trust *and* traffic.

✅ **SEO + social media = power combo**  
Instead of just relying on Instagram or Facebook, combine them with a website that ranks well on Google. Own your online space.

✅ **Email marketing still works**  
Even in Egypt. Especially for online stores, events, and service-based businesses.

✅ **Arabic-first strategy matters**  
Many local businesses overlook Arabic SEO, Arabic ad copy, and local dialect in content. That’s a huge mistake.

✅ **Data > guesses**  
Use tools like Google Analytics, Meta Business Suite, and Hotjar to see what people actually *do* on your site and socials. Then adjust.

Choosing paint for walls is not just a matter of color. Often, we make mistakes that can ruin the entire interior. Let's break down the main ones so you can avoid unpleasant surprises.



1. Not considering lighting. A color you like in the store may look completely different in your home. Be sure to test the paint under different lighting — both natural and artificial.



2. Ignoring wall texture. Smooth and rough surfaces perceive paint differently. Make sure you choose the right type of paint for your texture.



3. Not checking compatibility. If you plan to paint over previously painted walls, ensure the new paint is compatible with the old one. This will help avoid peeling issues.



4. Not considering the room's purpose. For bathrooms and kitchens, it's better to choose moisture-resistant and washable paints. This will not only extend the lifespan of the coating but also make wall maintenance easier.



5. Saving too much on quality. Cheap paints may look good at first glance, but they often require more coats and fade faster. Invest in quality materials — it will save you time and money in the long run.



6. Not planning ahead. Before you start, make a plan: what colors, what materials, how much time it will take. This will help avoid chaos and misunderstandings during the process.



Now that you know about common mistakes, you can make a more informed choice. Don't be afraid to experiment, but always keep your needs and the specifics of your space in mind!

1ju1jyz,Genealogy,Book name indexes: is it needed? How does one contend with edits?,"When I'm reading any genealogy book in print, I make heavy use out of the index of names in the back. As someone who is writing a series of books now, I'd love to include an index as well, but I am running into some serious issues, and would like some advice. 

Creation of the index isn't that difficult, but it is time consuming. Finding every name on every page, alphabetizing the list, then adding them to the Index chapter at the end of the book (right before the many pages of source citations). The problem arises whenever there is any type of edit on the book itself that invariably leads to the page numbers all getting changed. For instance:

1. Removing a copyrighted images previously added

2. Changing the font size, style, spacing, indent, etc.

3. Revision updates as new research is added

These books will not be professionally published to go into circulation. The few print copies I do make at my own expense  are solely for relatives and historical societies. It is my goal to distribute these books digitally whenever possible, and in that case Ctrl-F works much better to find names than a name index, so is an index of names even necessary?

They eventually moved and began renting it out, but the tenant hasn’t paid any rent. The property manager claims to be all handling court proceedings, but I suspect they may be running a scam. My sister left the home in December, and the tenant moved in this past January. I’m trying to help, though they don’t always share all the details with me. The tenant seems to be playing the system and appears very comfortable living in the home on my sister and her husband's dime.

1ju1jq6,Irrigation,Cycling fiasco,"Howdy all. Soooo. This one is stumping everyone with boots on the ground so far, so i am taking it to my trusty reddit. I Work for a small town public works, running the water distribution system, and in my daily travels it's time to take all my irrigation systems out of winter hibernation. All went well, until my last, and biggest sprinkler system(big is a bit of a stretch). Anyway, put all my 2"" unions back on containing the zone valves, turn on the main just before my backflow to check for leaks at the unions-none. However zone 6 is on, and watering as soon as that main is opened up. Walked over to the control (irritrol 12 zone) to check if zone 6 was running, and it was all off. I then tried turning zone 6 on, and off through manual at the control, but turning it on actually shut it down, for whatever time i set the manual run for. When the timer ran down, and turned to off, the sprinklers kicked on for that zone. Ok fine. I then put it back on, so they would shut down while checking all the other zones,  and head operations. All else worked fine, so tried swapping a new solenoid back to zone 6- no dice. Same problem, on for 30 seconds, off for 6 seconds, etc, etc etc. mabey i had dirt, bad diaphragm. Looked good, but swapped anyway-no dice. Same thing. Next i just tried a whole brand new 2"" irritrol zone valve out of the box. Again no dice, same thing. At this point i checked for signal going into the solenoid from the control, and got nothing while set to off, and had good signal when turned on. Again, turning it to run shuts it down, set to off cycles on/off at precise increments as stated above. Lastly, i swapped that zone solenoid with the next zone, and it worked fine on the next zone. Problem child zone 6 kept up with its same b.s. so at that, i completely cut all power to controller, unwired zone 6 completely, and opened the main valve. Same old same old, cycling on, and off, but now all zones came on for a few seconds, one by one shutting down until just zone 6 did it's cycling thing. 
Specs:
2"" inlet- 73 p.s.i./157 gpm
2"" backflow
2"" PVC manifold with 7 zones
All zones start 2"" then tapering to 1.5"" then 1"" over about 300ft give or take.
Heads are hunter I-25 with 5 to 7 heads per zone, but, zone 6 has only 4 hunter I-25 with 3 smaller rain bird rotors.

1ju1jlu,Needafriend,"32F/US/ I wanted to reach out to anyone that wants to be my friend/get to know me. I will be here for 24 hours waiting on any missed contacts, so I thought I would touch base with people that have missed out on contacting me.","Okay, some updates here for my profile. I thought I would make one last update before I go.

I never clarified, but I thought I should let people know that I randomly send voice clips out on Discord when gaming; that is honestly what is more comfortable for me. Being on the spectrum, I can't handle a long period of time on a phone. Unless you like the conversation to be, uh, paused for 30 seconds and then come up with a few more sentences, then rinse and repeat. I also personally get easily distracted while playing a game and trying to find something to say, and then, uhhhhh, 30 seconds and get a few sentences out. It's a lot easier for me to send voice clips when I want when we're playing video games together.

A handful of people expressed disappointment that all my games that are in co-op mode worldwide are on Nintendo. I'm sorry about that. If you want to know what I thought about the Nintendo Switch 2 and prices, you can read here in a post I made on r/SadCornerOfGamers. You can read there, and I wonder if anyone knows what video game pictures I used for the profile picture and background picture that I used. I wonder if you can send a chat request if you know we would be awesome friends if you do know!

I will say I've been a Nintendo membership subscriber for 4 years and counting, just the $20 a year plan though, so I guess that really shows that, yeah, all my co-op games are on Nintendo, haha.

I get asked about Minecraft if I played Minecraft on the Switch but not on the PC. But I'm sure the readers probably already knew this already, haha.  I don't know where the cartridge is; I have to find the game again. I've not played this game in ages, and I really mean that, because every time I played Minecraft for 30 minutes or an hour, I would nod off and doze off because the game was too relaxing, haha.

Final notes.

Send everything by chat request and not by commenting. If you would like to send your Discord handles over to my chat request, then please do so, but before you do, please make an entry on why you would like to get to know me.

Well, yes, that person said I had a bad attitude because I asked for Reddit users to go on their mobile app to look at the communities that I joined, because that's the only way you can look at what communities the Reddit users have joined—only through mobile. Anyways, the person said I had a bad attitude about this because he claimed I'm taking the fun out of people getting to know me as a person, and it's always best to ask the person naturally about themselves besides looking at their profile.

Um, okay? No, that doesn't ruin anything to get to know me naturally at all; these are conversation starters, conversation boosters, and a general idea on how to start a conversation with me, and if you claim that I've ruined the chance to get to know me just by looking at my communities that I've joined through the Reddit app or looking at my profile for 5-10 minutes, then that's just terrible; you basically have run out of conversations to have with me, which is quite hilarious if you're already out of conversations just by doing those simple steps.

Why am I leaving Reddit? I asked this several times in my inbox a few days ago, and it's simple. I did explain already, so I will just copy and paste the reasons here.

The last thing I will say is I never felt welcomed either because apparently people think I have a bad attitude when I ask someone to look at the communities that I've joined through the mobile app of Reddit to figure out conversation starters. Remember it's not that bad to be quirky, fun, and unique, and not only that, it's seriously not that bad to be a tad bit different than everyone else that doesn't let themselves sit in a box of normality. So, with that being said, the best way for this situation is just to leave.



If you want a deeper meaning on why I'm leaving Reddit, okay, sure, I guess if that is what you want.

Keep waving your red flag around for people to see, one person commented on my posts.

I had to delete several of my posts, not the one previously but the one before that. Several people were commenting on my posts when I didn't ask for people to comment on my post at all, which I think should be respected in the OP posts. If the Reddit user says, Don't comment, then don't comment on the posts. But this is where things steer off in the dark seas. Oof, OMG, really? Just why would anyone post a comment like this, which can draw unnecessary drama to me, which caused me to delete my posts because I didn't want people flooding my chat requests, and I had to block several users so those people wouldn't comment again when I repost. Anyways, these people were posting comments about.

You seem in distress about relationships. I think you should go see a relationship therapist specialist, find out about positive reinforcements, and then talk to your therapist about relationship goals to have before going into a relationship. Um, WTF? I can't believe someone honestly typed out a WHOLE PARAGRAPH ABOUT THIS! But that's not all; this is where things get really no comment. Hi, I really think you need to go to therapy for a few years to get your PTSD treatment to help with your flashbacks and nightmares so you can have healthier relationships. Um, WTF? Okay, first and foremost, I think before going on posting on people's posts that didn't even want comments in the first place, you don't have any right to vouch for couch doctor suggestions when you don't have PTSD, and clearly you don't; you're one of those people that think PTSD is all about nightmares and flashbacks, and you don't even take into account that those aren't the whole core aspects of PTSD in general. PTSD is so much more than flashbacks and nightmares, which, to be honest with everyone as someone with PTSD, I don't have nightmares and flashbacks anymore, but I do suffer from the mood/behavioral PTSD problems, which people apparently don't think exist for people with PTSD because people like the couch doctor that hid and sat on Reddit telling me about treating my PTSD flashbacks and nightmares for a healthier relationship totally forget that mood/behavioral problems are a huge core factor for people with PTSD. So, for people that want to play couch doctor and don't have PTSD themselves, please don't comment on people's Reddit posts when the OP never asked. Because on my posts I didn't, and I was looking for friends to talk about relationship issues, and if the person thinks they are cursed in having relationships, which I mean if people are creeped out about that on Reddit, that is a topic that I want to talk about from time to time to get things off my mind, then that's on you, because it's not really a creepy thing to ask. Because apparently there were a handful of people that wanted to converse in that and get to know me, so apparently there isn't an issue with this, and it seems to me that a person with just a normal small box view of the world seems to have an issue with it.

But you should stay to keep chatting with those handful of people that get you; you just have to wait out the storm and wait for these rare people that get you.

No thanks, I understand what you're saying, but I'd rather just leave and just be on Discord, and for people that truly want to get to know me, there is a way outside of here to do so, which I've left on my pinned posts. If you've missed out on this post and missed messaging me, I won't be here within 24 hours.

Now don't get me wrong, I've met a handful of wonderful people on subreddits that decided to reach out to get to know me instead of playing couch doctor. Unfortunately, the hidden couch doctors on subreddits have outweighed the positives and have left me with a negative outlook, which I can't seem to justify me staying on Reddit, but even if you miss me within 24 hours, you still have options to message me, so it's not like you don't at all. By the way, if you can guess where my username is from, that's going to be totally cool!

Just why would anyone post a comment like this, which can draw unnecessary drama to me, which caused me to delete my posts because I didn't want people flooding my chat requests, and I had to block several users so those people wouldn't comment again when I repost. Anyways, these people were posting comments about.

You seem in distress about relationships. I think you should go see a relationship therapist specialist, find out about positive reinforcements, and then talk to your therapist about relationship goals to have before going into a relationship. Um, WTF? I can't believe someone honestly typed out a WHOLE PARAGRAPH ABOUT THIS! But that's not all; this is where things get really no comment. Hi, I really think you need to go to therapy for a few years to get your PTSD treatment to help with your flashbacks and nightmares so you can have healthier relationships. Um, WTF? Okay, first and foremost, I think before going on posting on people's posts that didn't even want comments in the first place, you don't have any right to vouch for couch doctor suggestions when you don't have PTSD, and clearly you don't; you're one of those people that think PTSD is all about nightmares and flashbacks, and you don't even take into account that those aren't the whole core aspects of PTSD in general. PTSD is so much more than flashbacks and nightmares, which, to be honest with everyone as someone with PTSD, I don't have nightmares and flashbacks anymore, but I do suffer from the mood/behavioral PTSD problems, which people apparently don't think exist for people with PTSD because people like the couch doctor that hid and sat on Reddit telling me about treating my PTSD flashbacks and nightmares for a healthier relationship totally forget that mood/behavioral problems are a huge core factor for people with PTSD. So, for people that want to play couch doctor and don't have PTSD themselves, please don't comment on people's Reddit posts when the OP never asked. Because on my posts I didn't, and I was looking for friends to talk about relationship issues, and if the person thinks they are cursed in having relationships, which I mean if people are creeped out about that on Reddit, that is a topic that I want to talk about from time to time to get things off my mind, then that's on you, because it's not really a creepy thing to ask. Because apparently there were a handful of people that wanted to converse in that and get to know me, so apparently there isn't an issue with this, and it seems to me that a person with just a normal small box view of the world seems to have an issue with it.

But you should stay to keep chatting with those handful of people that get you; you just have to wait out the storm and wait for these rare people that get you.

No thanks, I understand what you're saying, but I'd rather just leave and just be on Discord, and for people that truly want to get to know me, there is a way outside of here to do so, which I've left on my pinned posts. If you've missed out on this post and missed messaging me, I won't be here within 24 hours.

Now don't get me wrong, I've met a handful of wonderful people on subreddits that decided to reach out to get to know me instead of playing couch doctor. Unfortunately, the hidden couch doctors on subreddits have outweighed the positives and have left me with a negative outlook, which I can't seem to justify me staying on Reddit, but even if you miss me within 24 hours, you still have options to message me, so it's not like you don't at all. By the way, if you can guess where my username is from, that's going to be totally cool!

1ju1j1a,BloggersCommunity,"CNFANS Clothes: Redefining Streetwear with Style, Comfort, and Consciousness","Fashion is more than just clothing—it's a statement, an identity, and for some, a movement. **CNFANS Clothes** is quickly emerging as a bold new force in the streetwear and casual fashion scene. Known for its sleek designs, versatile pieces, and a focus on quality, CNFANS is capturing the attention of trendsetters who want more than just hype—they want meaning, comfort, and individuality. With each release, the brand proves that style doesn’t have to come at the expense of comfort or conscience. Instead, it can reflect a lifestyle that’s confident, authentic, and forward-thinking.

The design language of [**CNFANS Clothes**](https://cnfanspreadsheet.co/shop?type=T-Shirt) is rooted in **urban culture, minimalism, and practical elegance**. From oversized hoodies and relaxed joggers to graphic tees and structured jackets, each piece feels both effortless and intentional. CNFANS doesn’t chase fast fashion trends—it sets its own. The collections speak to those who appreciate detail: muted palettes with bold accents, high-quality stitching, and thoughtful cuts that flatter a variety of body types. Whether you're dressing for a laid-back day or layering up for an edgy night out, CNFANS has mastered the art of wearable statement pieces.

One of the standout values of CNFANS Clothes is its **commitment to comfort without compromising aesthetics**. Every piece is made with hand-picked materials that balance softness, stretch, and durability. The brand’s design team focuses on fit and functionality, ensuring that whether you’re lounging at home or out in the city, you feel unrestricted and confident. Unlike many fashion labels that prioritize appearance over wearability, CNFANS believes that real style includes how you feel in your clothes, not just how you look. Their garments are designed to be lived in—slept in, danced in, moved in, and made your own.

But CNFANS Clothes isn't just about outerwear—it’s about **inner values** too. As the fashion world becomes more aware of its environmental and social impact, CNFANS is taking proactive steps toward responsible production. Many of its collections feature eco-friendly fabrics, low-waste packaging, and partnerships with ethical manufacturers. The brand is also working to reduce overproduction by creating limited runs that emphasize exclusivity while minimizing waste. For fashion lovers who care about sustainability, this gives CNFANS even more credibility. It’s not just about dressing well—it’s about **doing good** while looking good.

In a saturated market, CNFANS Clothes stands out not just for what it sells, but for what it represents: **a culture of cool confidence, personal expression, and modern values**. It’s for people who don’t just follow fashion—they live it, bend it, and break the rules when needed. As the brand continues to grow, it's building a strong community of fans, creators, and influencers who wear CNFANS not just as clothing, but as part of their identity. With its perfect blend of design, comfort, and conscious production, CNFANS is more than just a clothing line—it’s the future of everyday street style.",2025-04-08 01:08:02+00:00,1,0

1ju1iwo,AskDocs,Can't breathe while exercising!!,"I'm 16 yo girl and I've found that in the last few years it has gotten harder and harder to breathe while exercising. I'm constantly lightheaded which sucks being an athlete. It's definitely not because I'm out of shape since I exercise regularly and participate in a number of different sports and have since I was a kid. Despite being stronger and more 'fit' than most I run out of breath faster than my 10 year old sister!! My recovery is terrible as well - takes me WAYY longer than everyone to start breathing normally again and it's honestly embarrassing. 

Anytime this happens, my chest starts hurting really bad and I feel lightheaded. My breaths become almost short and raspy? Just going up the stairs can make me breathe a little heavy.

I've gone to my doctor numerous times for this - they took blood samples, tested my lung function and a specialist even gave me an inhaler (I'm definitely no doctor but it felt like a last resort type thing that acted as a placebo) - but nothing has helped. Also been swimming a lot to try and improve my lung capacity but my breathing still sucks and all I have now are broad shoulders.

Reaaally wish there was some sort of a solution or way to maybe train my lungs to be better :( thanks ",2025-04-08 01:07:49+00:00,1,1

I could plug my laptop directly into the LAN side of the injector and get connectivity, but now that is not work either. The link is still up and good, but I cannot get connection from the station side. Any ideas? I have not upgraded the firmware in quite some time on these, but this seems like a hardware issue.

I should also note I set Flex switch port to 100FDX to match the Nanobeam interface with no success. No connectivity either auto or forced rate. I have this same setup connected to a set of Nanobeam AC units (gigabit interfaces) with no issues. Any help appreciated!",2025-04-08 01:07:28+00:00,1,1

Have you ever wondered why pineapples don’t grow on trees or why clocks run clockwise instead of counterclockwise? The universe is full of mysteries, like why we park in driveways and drive on parkways. Speaking of which, if a tomato is technically a fruit, does that mean ketchup is a smoothie? And why do we say ""tuna fish"" but not ""beef mammal""? The world is a strange place, filled with unanswered questions. For instance, why do we press harder on remote controls when the batteries are dying, as if our sheer willpower can somehow revive them? Or why do we nod to say ""yes"" and shake our heads to say ""no""? Could it have been the other way around in an alternate reality? And let’s not even get started on why we call it ""after dark"" when it’s really just ""after light."" The English language is a wild ride—like how ""abbreviation"" is such a long word or how ""phonetically"" isn’t spelled phonetically. Also, why do we sing ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game"" when we’re already there? Shouldn’t it be ""I’m at the Ball Game, Let’s Watch""? And don’t even ask why bread always lands butter-side down. Maybe gravity has a personal vendetta against toast. Either way, life is weird, and the more you think about it, the weirder it gets.  ",2025-04-08 01:07:17+00:00,0,1

1ju1ig4,sennheiser,Secondhand purchases and upgrades.,"Hi Sennheiser Reddit. 

A little over a year ago, I got my 458BTs refurbished from a store. While I have no idea how old they were when I picked them up, they've served me very well for this past year, and especially well given the price I paid ($70 CAD). 

However. All good things must come to an end, and I'm concerned that I might be approaching the end of the road with my current set. About a few weeks ago, I noticed that my headphones began playing a constant trill of beeps whenever I had them on but not playing music. This problem does go away when I start playing music, so it's not a dealbreaker... yet. (I've also had some concerns about how quickly the battery life goes from 20% to 0, but that's me nitpicking.)

Last week, while running late for a event, my 458s refused to connect with my iphone. I pulled out a backup set and completed my day as normal, but I'm concerned that this will become a long running issue in the future. 

Fast forward to today. I've browsed the store I got the 458s from and saw that they're selling Momentum 4s (again, refurbished), for $200 CAD. I feel like I can reasonably trust the seller. The price is acceptable (the official website has a price tag of $500 CAD in comparison), and I'm unsure how long my current set can keep going before becoming unusable. 

With the preamble out of the way, I have two questions. 

1: For those who have upgraded from the 450BTs (or any low end model, for that matter) to the Momentum series, what is the difference? Is the sound much better? Are there more smart control features compared to the relatively basic options available for the 458s? 

2: For those who have bought secondhand/refurbished, what can I expect as the lifetime of my product? A year? Two? More than that? 

Thanks. ",2025-04-08 01:07:13+00:00,1,0

Read **The Strawberry Patch Pancake House PDF** by **Laurie Gilmore** released on March 11, 2025.

Fall in love with the brand new spring romance set in Dream Harbor, from the bestselling author of The Pumpkin Spice Café.

As a renowned chef, single-dad Archer never planned on moving to a small town, let alone running a pancake restaurant. But Dream Harbor needs a new chef, and Archer needs a community to help raise his daughter, Olive.

Iris has never managed to hold down a job for more than a few months. So when Mayor Kelly suggests Archer is looking for a nanny, and Iris might be available, she shudders at the thought. But in need of money she reluctantly agrees.

As Archer and Iris get used to their new roles, is it possible that they might have more in common than they first thought, or is Olive just determined to play match-maker…

Tropes:

• single dad
• forced proximity
• slow burn
• found family
• one bed

Quick note:
Fuel sending unit’s shot, so I’m running an aftermarket electric pump mounted near the tank.

Here’s what I’ve already picked up:
	•	Edelbrock 2176 intake manifold
	•	Edelbrock 7276 intake gasket
	•	Edelbrock 1481 throttle linkage adapter
	•	Edelbrock 2732 carb spacer/insulator

	•	MicroGard fuel filter
	•	Accel 4-pin HEI module (Chevy style)
	•	Voltage regulator
	•	Electronic distributor w/ vacuum advance
	•	Fuel pump relay + inline fuse
	•	Toggle switch for the pump
	•	Summit Racing electric fuel pump (5-7 PSI)

Still need to grab:
	•	Edelbrock 600 CFM carb w/ electric choke

It wasn’t so loud or noticeable or anything. Car runs great, no codes or shutter or anything like that. However, this weekend it got louder. It doesn’t happen on start up and first acceleration. But when the engine is warm and is running after a while, I can hear the friction noise much louder. It only happened at first when I began light acceleration and went away at around 3rd gear. Now it happens the same when the car was idle. I was stuck in traffic on Saturday because of a wreck and the car was sitting and not moving and it was growling from that friction noise. Its not a knock or tapping sound and its not squeaky, its like a metallic growling sound. Any thoughts? I have a platinum warranty on the car until 2027 and plan to take it to the dealer for diagnosis on Thursday and won’t be driving it until then. But wanted to see if anyone has any ideas.

1ju1huy,conlangs,Biweekly Telephone Game v3 (668),"This is a game of borrowing and loaning words! To give our conlangs a more naturalistic flair, this game can help us get realistic loans into our language by giving us an artificial-ish ""world"" to pull words from!

The Telephone Game will be posted every Monday and Friday, hopefully. 

### Rules

1) Post a word in your language, with IPA and a definition.

Note: try to show your word inflected, as it would appear in a typical sentence. This can be the source of many interesting borrowings in natlangs (like how so many Arabic words were borrowed with the definite article fossilized onto it! algebra, alcohol, etc.)

2) Respond to a post by adapting the word to your language's phonology, and consider shifting the meaning of the word a bit!

3) Sometimes, you may see an interesting phrase or construction in a language. Instead of adopting the word as a loan word, you are welcome to **calque** the phrase -- for example, taking *skyscraper* by using your language's native words for *sky* and *scraper*. If you do this, please label the post at the start as **Calque** so people don't get confused about your path of adopting/loaning.

1ju1hdn,KarenReadTrial,"I thought she was innocent. The Body in the Snow documentary convinced me she's guilty. Karen Read ""testimony"" compared with just the facts.","**To preface**: 

I watched the trial & I watched all the testimonies. I genuinely thought she was being framed & Alan Jackson is *so* good that I just focused on how suspicious the cops & the people at 34 Fairview seemed based on their actions and testimony. This weekend I ended up watching the Body in the Snow documentary. I am flabbergasted. Why didn't any of you tell me? 

**Karen Read's ""Testimony"" — An actual transcript of what Karen says happened that night (as stated by Karen Read in episode 1)**:

>So, I’m driving and John got on the phone with Jen and he’s telling me it’s “34 Fairview” and we arrive at 34 Fairview. It didn’t look like there was any soiree going on. It didn’t look inviting. The outside was dark and I didn’t see any familiar looking vehicles. And I said, “John, can you make sure we’re welcome?”. And he said, “I’ll run in”. So, when John got out of the car at Brian Albert’s house he took my full vodka soda which was sitting in the cup holder. And he walked up the driveway, and John always walked — kind of skipped and walked at the same time — he was always in a rush. And I saw him reach the breezeway door which is the \[second\] side-front door. And *you* open the door and went to walk in. And **I waited probably a minute** and he doesn’t come. And it only took like **2 or 3 minutes that** — for me to be irritated. So I started…so **I called him**. I didn’t want to wait for him to respond to a text. And he didn’t answer. I said “You’ve got to be fucking kidding me. What are you doing? You just went in and I’m sitting here. Either we’re welcome or we’re not, but it shouldn’t take you 5 minutes to determine that.” And then **about 10 minutes went by & I left** & I was not happy. 

The above account compared with [Trooper Guarino's Evidence Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AtrP_a8HAqSZVtZpIRTUQjNNq6QHGnIm/view):

**12:24:40 AM**: Karen and John arrive at 34 Fairview (car is stopped in the area of the flag pole and fire hydrant). **This is a fact**, unless you're arguing the GPS data was tampered with. Now based on Karen's above ""testimony""...

**\~12:25:40**: By this point (1 minute after arriving) Karen & John **should've had** enough time to have the ""John, can you make sure we're welcome?"" conversation, and John should've ""ran in"". This time (12:25:40) is being extremely generous & I'd argue that IF John entered that house it should have occurred **sooner** than 12:25. Remember: Ryan Nagel, Heather Maxom, and Ricky D'Antuono had arrived immediately after Karen (they both turned into Fairview from Cedarcrest Rd). Ryan Nagel sent his sister Julie a text saying ""here"" at 12:23. All 3 witnesses testified they never saw anyone get out of the car, and Heather Maxom even testified she saw a male in the passenger seat. What does this mean? Either (1) John O'Keefe entered the 34 Fairview house at 12:25 or sooner or (2) John O'Keefe entered the house *later* and all the witnesses are lying or (3) John O'Keefe entered the house *later* and none of the 3 witnesses (4, if we include Julie) saw him or (4) John O'Keefe was sitting in that car and never got out while the witnesses were there

We can argue testimony is biased, but let's continue based on what KAREN READ herself said.

**\~12:26:40**: By this point, Karen Read had ""waited probably a minute"".

**\~12:28:40 / 12:29:40**: By this point it has been 2-3 minutes and Karen was ""irritated"" and she started ""calling"" him. What do phone records say? [Phone data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14dDddMovlgBD5aUR3IQ1_6cUbyWNi2pR/view) says Karen's first call to John occurred at *12:33:35*. It's also important to note that John's Health Data shows he has not taken ANY steps at this time (last time he took any ""steps"" corresponding to the car moving was at 12:24:22). Let's go on.

**\~12:38:40 / 12:39:40**: According to Karen's above ""testimony"", this would have been ""about 10 minutes"" of Karen waiting. It is at this time she would've **started to drive** home. BUT We KNOW this is impossible. Karen was connecting to John's Wifi at 12:36. She was already calling John at 12:33, 12:34, 12:35, etc. 

According to the Health Data, John took 36 steps from 12:31:56 to 12:32:16.

**Discussion based on the above findings**:

I kid you not, as I was watching these words come out of Karen Reads mouth my jaw dropped. I always sort of skimmed past the part about why she stayed in the car (which in retrospect, wtf?). There are multiple things to dissect here. 

First of all, her story doesn't make sense strictly in a common sense way. You're telling me as a 40+ year old woman you're going to leave your drunk boyfriend at this house & you don't even attempt to go inside to tell him you're leaving? Then you leave these angry voicemails calling him a pervert over...this? There is absolutely no way. In my opinion, John and Karen got into a verbal fight on their way to 34 Fairview, or an argument ensued as they parked outside. John never got out of that car until 12:31:56 as evidenced by the health data. They were sitting there arguing, perhaps not even yelling, and at about 12:29 Ryan Nagel and the other 2 witnesses drove away. Karen and John continued to argue until John had enough. At 12:31 he stepped out of that car and started to walk towards the house assuming Karen would follow. Instead, Karen contemplates and decides she's going to prove her point. She was going to leave him there. She begins to drive away. John, realizing Karen actually drove off, turns around and walks back towards the road in an attempt to stop her. Now whether or not she saw him in her rear-view mirror and *intentionally* hit him is debatable. Logic says yes, because why else would she be driving in reverse? Is it possible Karen hit him & didn't realize? Perhaps. The voicemails suggest she didn't know he was hit, but this entire night also suggests she was drunk out of her mind and driving. I can definitely see her driving into him, blacking out, and having no recollection it even happened the next morning. **The point is, sometime at 12:32 John is laying there where his body was found and according to Karen's own ""testimony"" she would have been right at the scene at 12:32.** 

**Other Implications/ Q&A:**

**Q**: ""So now you think she's guilty & that's it""?

**A**: No, that isn't it. I think MULTIPLE THINGS can be true in this case. I think it can be true that Karen, did indeed, hit John with her car ultimately killing him. I think the police was *extremely* incompetent, unprofessional, and biased. I think many involved, including police, are corrupt. I think a combination of that incompetence and corruption leaves room for reasonable doubt. I also think multiple people in that house are honestly quite terrible people for multiple reasons none of which necessarily have to do with John's murder (i.e. the amount of drinking and driving that goes on, disposing of evidence, cheating, etc.).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Q**: Explain missing footage at John's house when Karen arrived at \~12:40 am, explain the botched evidence collection, explain the mirrored video of the Lexus, explain the pieces of tail light found days later, etc.

**A**: Like I said, I believe the police is corrupt. I absolutely think evidence was tampered with. I would even go as far to say that they planted pieces of that tail light onto the crime scenes days after the crime in order to attempt to save their ass and make an easier case against Karen Read. I genuinely believe these people are capable of such. I'm not defending their actions, I'm only offering an explanation. They didn't investigate Brian Albert/the house because he was ""one of the boys in blue"". That's the sad reality.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Q**: Explain Jen McCabe deleting texts, explain Brian Higgins destroying his phone, etc. Generally explain all the suspicious behavior of the 34 Fairview crowd.

**A**: There are a few things. I think these people had things to hide, but it wasn't the murder of John O'Keefe. In my opinion, the GPS/phone data doesn't support any theories suggesting their involvement. I think some of them were hiding things ranging from more embarrassing texts \*cough\*Brian Higgins\*cough\*, weird porn fetishes, potential affairs, potential drug use, potential distribution of drugs, potential evidence implicating them in other botched police cases, and/or other crimes, etc. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Q**: What would it take for you to think Karen Read is innocent again?

**A**: I'd need proof that the above GPS/phone data presented isn't true. If the defense can convince me (truthfully) that this data was manipulated, or that there is more specific data impacting this timeline I'd definitely re-evaluate everything. If there is camera footage recovered suggesting Karen Read wasn't at the scene at \~12:31. If Chloe comes forth & admits to biting John's arm I'll re-evaluate it all. But in all seriousness, despite any evidence manipulation, testimony, suspicious acts, etc. the hard evidence needs to fit the puzzle. There are certain things that are simply factual i.e. time of arrival to 34 Fairview...again, unless the police is tampering with that too.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I'd be happy to have a civil discussion regarding anything I've stated as long as you're someone who actually listened to the testimony/watched the trial and READ THE DOCUMENTS FOR YOURSELF. There is way too much being said that simply isn't true and people are using that to form their opinion i.e. ""John's phone ascended/descended 3 flights of stairs! He was in the basement!"". You're right, the phone ascended/descended...but at 12:22 AM when he wasn't even at 34 Fairview yet and can be explained by the change in elevation. Again, I was certain KR is being framed, but I cannot unsee this timeline straight out of the horses mouth.

1ju1hd3,Fungalacne,Successful Routine - Before & After,"Hi all thought I’d share my journey here and also ask for moisturizer recommendations. My skin is very dry and I haven’t found the perfect one yet! 

How I knew it was FA:
* Bumpy texture - the small bumps were literally everywhere. Pretty consistent size and didn’t really come to a head unless I squeezed at them. When they did pop it was clear liquid not yellow or white puss like a normal pimple.
* Clusters of bumps - new breakouts would appear in clusters of bumps never just one. It also started on my jawline in clusters about a week before it showed up on my whole face.
* Sudden onset - my skin was doing well overall and I thought I had nailed my routine. Bumps spread to basically my whole face pretty much overnight. I suspect recent antibiotics and new products caused the breakout.
* Acne treatment did nothing - usually my breakouts responded well to salicylic acid but this time my spot treatment (Murad) had no impact. Neither did pimple patches.
* Itching - it was kind of itchy. Nothing crazy but definitely more than usual.

CURRENT routine:
1. Cleanse with bioderma micellar water if I wore sunscreen or makeup 
2. Nizoral mask twice a week
3. Second cleanse with dermalogica special cleansing gel
4. Chemical exfoliant COSRX AHA/BHA toner twice a week on days I don’t Nizoral
5. Beauty of Joseon ginseng toner
6. Skin Fix+ barrier gel moisturizer 

PURGED from my routine:
* Oil cleanser - Beauty of Joseon ginseng cleansing oil
* Caudalie Vinoperfect serum - so disappointed bc this was so expensive. But I broke out shortly after adding this to my routine.
* Moisturizer - First Aid Beauty ultra repair cream 

ADDED to my routine: 
* Bioderma micellar water - to remove makeup on a cotton pad (not shown in the pic sorry)
* Nizoral anti dandruff shampoo ketoconazole 1% - used like a mask for 3-5 minutes every other day between removing makeup followed by a second cleanse 
* New moisturizer 
    * Inisfree Youth Enriched Cream with Orchid - this was the first moisturizer I tried and it did help immediately. Left my skin a little greasy tho.
    * Iunik Centella Calming Gel Cream - made my skin DRY but didn’t cause new bumps.
    * Skin Fix+ Barrier+ skin barrier restoring GEL cream - this one was my favorite unfortunately since it’s $50 for 1.7oz 🥲 but it made my skin feel amazing. Still a bit dry so I am looking to replace once I run out.

KEPT in my routine:
* Cleanser (twice daily) - dermalogica special cleansing gel
* Toner (twice daily) - Beauty of Joseon ginseng essence water 
* Chemical exfoliation (twice a week after cleaning but not at the same time as Nizoral) - COSRX AHA/BHA clarifying treatment toner

1ju1hci,lookingforfriendship,"32F/US/ I wanted to reach out to anyone that wants to be my friend/get to know me. I will be here for 24 hours waiting on any missed contacts, so I thought I would touch base with people that have missed out on contacting me.","Okay, some updates here for my profile. I thought I would make one last update before I go.

I never clarified, but I thought I should let people know that I randomly send voice clips out on Discord when gaming; that is honestly what is more comfortable for me. Being on the spectrum, I can't handle a long period of time on a phone. Unless you like the conversation to be, uh, paused for 30 seconds and then come up with a few more sentences, then rinse and repeat. I also personally get easily distracted while playing a game and trying to find something to say, and then, uhhhhh, 30 seconds and get a few sentences out. It's a lot easier for me to send voice clips when I want when we're playing video games together.

A handful of people expressed disappointment that all my games that are in co-op mode worldwide are on Nintendo. I'm sorry about that. If you want to know what I thought about the Nintendo Switch 2 and prices, you can read here in a post I made on r/SadCornerOfGamers. You can read there, and I wonder if anyone knows what video game pictures I used for the profile picture and background picture that I used. I wonder if you can send a chat request if you know we would be awesome friends if you do know!

I will say I've been a Nintendo membership subscriber for 4 years and counting, just the $20 a year plan though, so I guess that really shows that, yeah, all my co-op games are on Nintendo, haha.

I get asked about Minecraft if I played Minecraft on the Switch but not on the PC. But I'm sure the readers probably already knew this already, haha.  I don't know where the cartridge is; I have to find the game again. I've not played this game in ages, and I really mean that, because every time I played Minecraft for 30 minutes or an hour, I would nod off and doze off because the game was too relaxing, haha.

Final notes.

Send everything by chat request and not by commenting. If you would like to send your Discord handles over to my chat request, then please do so, but before you do, please make an entry on why you would like to get to know me.

Well, yes, that person said I had a bad attitude because I asked for Reddit users to go on their mobile app to look at the communities that I joined, because that's the only way you can look at what communities the Reddit users have joined—only through mobile. Anyways, the person said I had a bad attitude about this because he claimed I'm taking the fun out of people getting to know me as a person, and it's always best to ask the person naturally about themselves besides looking at their profile.

Um, okay? No, that doesn't ruin anything to get to know me naturally at all; these are conversation starters, conversation boosters, and a general idea on how to start a conversation with me, and if you claim that I've ruined the chance to get to know me just by looking at my communities that I've joined through the Reddit app or looking at my profile for 5-10 minutes, then that's just terrible; you basically have run out of conversations to have with me, which is quite hilarious if you're already out of conversations just by doing those simple steps.

Why am I leaving Reddit? I asked this several times in my inbox a few days ago, and it's simple. I did explain already, so I will just copy and paste the reasons here.

The last thing I will say is I never felt welcomed either because apparently people think I have a bad attitude when I ask someone to look at the communities that I've joined through the mobile app of Reddit to figure out conversation starters. Remember it's not that bad to be quirky, fun, and unique, and not only that, it's seriously not that bad to be a tad bit different than everyone else that doesn't let themselves sit in a box of normality. So, with that being said, the best way for this situation is just to leave.  


If you want a deeper meaning on why I'm leaving Reddit, okay, sure, I guess if that is what you want.

Keep waving your red flag around for people to see, one person commented on my posts.

I had to delete several of my posts, not the one previously but the one before that. Several people were commenting on my posts when I didn't ask for people to comment on my post at all, which I think should be respected in the OP posts. If the Reddit user says, Don't comment, then don't comment on the posts. But this is where things steer off in the dark seas. Oof, OMG, really? Just why would anyone post a comment like this, which can draw unnecessary drama to me, which caused me to delete my posts because I didn't want people flooding my chat requests, and I had to block several users so those people wouldn't comment again when I repost. Anyways, these people were posting comments about.

You seem in distress about relationships. I think you should go see a relationship therapist specialist, find out about positive reinforcements, and then talk to your therapist about relationship goals to have before going into a relationship. Um, WTF? I can't believe someone honestly typed out a WHOLE PARAGRAPH ABOUT THIS! But that's not all; this is where things get really no comment. Hi, I really think you need to go to therapy for a few years to get your PTSD treatment to help with your flashbacks and nightmares so you can have healthier relationships. Um, WTF? Okay, first and foremost, I think before going on posting on people's posts that didn't even want comments in the first place, you don't have any right to vouch for couch doctor suggestions when you don't have PTSD, and clearly you don't; you're one of those people that think PTSD is all about nightmares and flashbacks, and you don't even take into account that those aren't the whole core aspects of PTSD in general. PTSD is so much more than flashbacks and nightmares, which, to be honest with everyone as someone with PTSD, I don't have nightmares and flashbacks anymore, but I do suffer from the mood/behavioral PTSD problems, which people apparently don't think exist for people with PTSD because people like the couch doctor that hid and sat on Reddit telling me about treating my PTSD flashbacks and nightmares for a healthier relationship totally forget that mood/behavioral problems are a huge core factor for people with PTSD. So, for people that want to play couch doctor and don't have PTSD themselves, please don't comment on people's Reddit posts when the OP never asked. Because on my posts I didn't, and I was looking for friends to talk about relationship issues, and if the person thinks they are cursed in having relationships, which I mean if people are creeped out about that on Reddit, that is a topic that I want to talk about from time to time to get things off my mind, then that's on you, because it's not really a creepy thing to ask. Because apparently there were a handful of people that wanted to converse in that and get to know me, so apparently there isn't an issue with this, and it seems to me that a person with just a normal small box view of the world seems to have an issue with it.

But you should stay to keep chatting with those handful of people that get you; you just have to wait out the storm and wait for these rare people that get you.

No thanks, I understand what you're saying, but I'd rather just leave and just be on Discord, and for people that truly want to get to know me, there is a way outside of here to do so, which I've left on my pinned posts. If you've missed out on this post and missed messaging me, I won't be here within 24 hours.

Now don't get me wrong, I've met a handful of wonderful people on subreddits that decided to reach out to get to know me instead of playing couch doctor. Unfortunately, the hidden couch doctors on subreddits have outweighed the positives and have left me with a negative outlook, which I can't seem to justify me staying on Reddit, but even if you miss me within 24 hours, you still have options to message me, so it's not like you don't at all. By the way, if you can guess where my username is from, that's going to be totally cool!

Small hint: it's a healing movie shouted in an RPG game. May the odds ever be in your favor to figure things out, and good luck!",2025-04-08 01:05:39+00:00,1,0

1ju1hag,malafaatadv,Web Design in Egypt – Why Your Online Presence Matters More Than Ever (From an Egyptian Perspective),"Hey everyone!

I wanted to share something I've been working on that I think a lot of Egyptian business owners, creatives, and entrepreneurs might find useful. I run a platform called [**Malafaat**](https://www.malafaat.com) that focuses on **web design and digital identity** for businesses here in Egypt.

[Web Design in Egypt – Why Your Online Presence Matters More Than Ever \(From an Egyptian Perspective\)](https://preview.redd.it/s05q6orr3ate1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=f51b1cf8dda21f6ce47e07bada262c6a99a85166)

After working with a variety of local brands—from startups in Cairo to family-run stores in Alexandria—I’ve noticed a huge gap between how businesses *present themselves online* and what their customers actually expect in 2025.

Here’s the truth: **if your business doesn’t look professional online, people will bounce**. That goes for restaurants, clothing brands, service providers—you name it. A slow, outdated, or confusing website is just as bad as having no website at all.

# Why Web Design in Egypt Needs to Level Up

Egypt has amazing talent, creative energy, and an entrepreneurial spirit. But too many businesses still rely on:

* A basic Facebook page (which kills your credibility for higher-end clients)
* A website that hasn’t been updated since 2016
* DIY templates that don’t reflect their unique brand

# What We Do at Malafaat

At **Malafaat**, we help Egyptian businesses build clean, fast, mobile-first websites that are both beautiful and functional. Whether you’re a startup, a freelancer, or a larger business looking to refresh your online image, we make the process easy and affordable.

Some of the things we focus on:

* Custom web design tailored to your industry
* Arabic + English bilingual sites
* Fast loading speeds for Egyptian networks
* SEO optimization for local Google searches

# Let’s Talk

If you’re thinking about leveling up your business online—or even just curious about how your site could be improved—I’d love to hear from you.

Feel free to ask me anything about:

* Choosing the right platform (WordPress vs custom)
* What makes a site *actually* convert visitors
* Pricing & how to avoid getting ripped off
* Branding & user experience in Egypt’s market

1ju1h2e,DogAdvice,Anal Gland Mass,"My 14 year old JRT had a small red bump on his anus, I figured it was nothing serious but definitely needed to be checked out. He seemed to be licking and itchy so I made an appointment for their soonest opening, as I thought it was impacted glands and irritated. Within 5 days, the red bump has swollen into a mass about the size of a small donut ball. It had broken open and bleeding, mostly after he poops. 

The vet today said it’s an anal gland mass, unknown “but likely” cancerous. We took chest x-rays to see if the cancer had spread anywhere else as he had some bio markers from a previous lump that suggested he may have a form of cancer. His chest looked cancer free but they did find that he has a grade 2 trachea collapse. 

We decided to run a comprehensive lab panel to see if his pre-Addison levels had progressed and to determine whether or not he could be an okay candidate for surgical removal, as she says it is “medically necessary” to have it removed. The other issue is he is in heart failure, she feels that he is at a 60-70% chance of dying on the table from the anesthesia alone. If his Addison’s has progressed or his other levels come back elevated, it will be an absolute no go for surgery. 

Our regular vet who is also a surgeon will not take him on as a patient, but did make us a referral pending the results of his labs. Not sure the specialist will even consider it. 

I am so lost, the vet said if it was her dog she would absolutely NOT do the surgery and start making end of life plans because these masses typically continue to grow at a rapid rate. 

I feel like I’m damned if I do and damned if I don’t. Either way, the results feel the same. Im wondering if others out there have had dogs with anal masses and if so, did you operate? If you didn’t, how much time did you end up having with your loved pup until they crossed the rainbow bridge? 

My heart feels like it’s being torn in two and despite all of the issues found, my pup is his happy normal self. ",2025-04-08 01:05:16+00:00,1,0
1ju1h0r,chat,"32F/US/ I wanted to reach out to anyone that wants to be my friend/get to know me. I will be here for 24 hours waiting on any missed contacts, so I thought I would touch base with people that have missed out on contacting me.","Okay, some updates here for my profile. I thought I would make one last update before I go.

I never clarified, but I thought I should let people know that I randomly send voice clips out on Discord when gaming; that is honestly what is more comfortable for me. Being on the spectrum, I can't handle a long period of time on a phone. Unless you like the conversation to be, uh, paused for 30 seconds and then come up with a few more sentences, then rinse and repeat. I also personally get easily distracted while playing a game and trying to find something to say, and then, uhhhhh, 30 seconds and get a few sentences out. It's a lot easier for me to send voice clips when I want when we're playing video games together.

A handful of people expressed disappointment that all my games that are in co-op mode worldwide are on Nintendo. I'm sorry about that. If you want to know what I thought about the Nintendo Switch 2 and prices, you can read here in a post I made on r/SadCornerOfGamers. You can read there, and I wonder if anyone knows what video game pictures I used for the profile picture and background picture that I used. I wonder if you can send a chat request if you know we would be awesome friends if you do know!

I will say I've been a Nintendo membership subscriber for 4 years and counting, just the $20 a year plan though, so I guess that really shows that, yeah, all my co-op games are on Nintendo, haha.

I get asked about Minecraft if I played Minecraft on the Switch but not on the PC. But I'm sure the readers probably already knew this already, haha.  I don't know where the cartridge is; I have to find the game again. I've not played this game in ages, and I really mean that, because every time I played Minecraft for 30 minutes or an hour, I would nod off and doze off because the game was too relaxing, haha.

Final notes.

Send everything by chat request and not by commenting. If you would like to send your Discord handles over to my chat request, then please do so, but before you do, please make an entry on why you would like to get to know me.

Well, yes, that person said I had a bad attitude because I asked for Reddit users to go on their mobile app to look at the communities that I joined, because that's the only way you can look at what communities the Reddit users have joined—only through mobile. Anyways, the person said I had a bad attitude about this because he claimed I'm taking the fun out of people getting to know me as a person, and it's always best to ask the person naturally about themselves besides looking at their profile.

Um, okay? No, that doesn't ruin anything to get to know me naturally at all; these are conversation starters, conversation boosters, and a general idea on how to start a conversation with me, and if you claim that I've ruined the chance to get to know me just by looking at my communities that I've joined through the Reddit app or looking at my profile for 5-10 minutes, then that's just terrible; you basically have run out of conversations to have with me, which is quite hilarious if you're already out of conversations just by doing those simple steps.

Why am I leaving Reddit? I asked this several times in my inbox a few days ago, and it's simple. I did explain already, so I will just copy and paste the reasons here.

The last thing I will say is I never felt welcomed either because apparently people think I have a bad attitude when I ask someone to look at the communities that I've joined through the mobile app of Reddit to figure out conversation starters. Remember it's not that bad to be quirky, fun, and unique, and not only that, it's seriously not that bad to be a tad bit different than everyone else that doesn't let themselves sit in a box of normality. So, with that being said, the best way for this situation is just to leave.  


If you want a deeper meaning on why I'm leaving Reddit, okay, sure, I guess if that is what you want.

Keep waving your red flag around for people to see, one person commented on my posts.

I had to delete several of my posts, not the one previously but the one before that. Several people were commenting on my posts when I didn't ask for people to comment on my post at all, which I think should be respected in the OP posts. If the Reddit user says, Don't comment, then don't comment on the posts. But this is where things steer off in the dark seas. Oof, OMG, really? Just why would anyone post a comment like this, which can draw unnecessary drama to me, which caused me to delete my posts because I didn't want people flooding my chat requests, and I had to block several users so those people wouldn't comment again when I repost. Anyways, these people were posting comments about.

You seem in distress about relationships. I think you should go see a relationship therapist specialist, find out about positive reinforcements, and then talk to your therapist about relationship goals to have before going into a relationship. Um, WTF? I can't believe someone honestly typed out a WHOLE PARAGRAPH ABOUT THIS! But that's not all; this is where things get really no comment. Hi, I really think you need to go to therapy for a few years to get your PTSD treatment to help with your flashbacks and nightmares so you can have healthier relationships. Um, WTF? Okay, first and foremost, I think before going on posting on people's posts that didn't even want comments in the first place, you don't have any right to vouch for couch doctor suggestions when you don't have PTSD, and clearly you don't; you're one of those people that think PTSD is all about nightmares and flashbacks, and you don't even take into account that those aren't the whole core aspects of PTSD in general. PTSD is so much more than flashbacks and nightmares, which, to be honest with everyone as someone with PTSD, I don't have nightmares and flashbacks anymore, but I do suffer from the mood/behavioral PTSD problems, which people apparently don't think exist for people with PTSD because people like the couch doctor that hid and sat on Reddit telling me about treating my PTSD flashbacks and nightmares for a healthier relationship totally forget that mood/behavioral problems are a huge core factor for people with PTSD. So, for people that want to play couch doctor and don't have PTSD themselves, please don't comment on people's Reddit posts when the OP never asked. Because on my posts I didn't, and I was looking for friends to talk about relationship issues, and if the person thinks they are cursed in having relationships, which I mean if people are creeped out about that on Reddit, that is a topic that I want to talk about from time to time to get things off my mind, then that's on you, because it's not really a creepy thing to ask. Because apparently there were a handful of people that wanted to converse in that and get to know me, so apparently there isn't an issue with this, and it seems to me that a person with just a normal small box view of the world seems to have an issue with it.

But you should stay to keep chatting with those handful of people that get you; you just have to wait out the storm and wait for these rare people that get you.

No thanks, I understand what you're saying, but I'd rather just leave and just be on Discord, and for people that truly want to get to know me, there is a way outside of here to do so, which I've left on my pinned posts. If you've missed out on this post and missed messaging me, I won't be here within 24 hours.

Now don't get me wrong, I've met a handful of wonderful people on subreddits that decided to reach out to get to know me instead of playing couch doctor. Unfortunately, the hidden couch doctors on subreddits have outweighed the positives and have left me with a negative outlook, which I can't seem to justify me staying on Reddit, but even if you miss me within 24 hours, you still have options to message me, so it's not like you don't at all. By the way, if you can guess where my username is from, that's going to be totally cool!

Small hint: it's a healing movie shouted in an RPG game. May the odds ever be in your favor to figure things out, and good luck!",2025-04-08 01:05:13+00:00,1,0

## The Power of Scent Marketing: why Choose a Commercial Scent Diffuser?

Scent marketing leverages the power of fragrance to create a memorable and emotionally resonant experience for customers. Unlike visual or auditory cues, scent directly impacts the limbic system, the part of the brain responsible for emotions and memories. By strategically introducing carefully selected scents, businesses can influence customer behavior, enhance brand perception, and even increase sales. The right fragrance can transform a sterile lobby into a welcoming oasis, a retail store into an enticing shopping haven, or a gym into an energizing workout space.

A commercial scent diffuser is a complex device designed to release fragrance evenly and consistently across a large area.Unlike consumer-grade diffusers that rely on heat or evaporation, commercial models often utilize cold air diffusion technology. This advanced technology converts fragrance oil into a dry nano-mist, ensuring long-lasting scent without altering the oil's composition or therapeutic properties. This dry mist ensures the scent hangs in the air longer and doesn’t leave residue on surfaces. For business owners and managers, facility managers, and marketing agencies seeking to elevate their brand experience, a high-quality commercial scent diffuser is a valuable investment. Businesses in the hospitality industry, retail stores, spas, and hotels can especially benefit.

1ju1h07,PowerBI,Power BI Freelancing: Frequently Asked Questions,"A lot of the same questions on Power BI freelancing and consulting come up again and again so I thought I’d make an FAQ.

# Technical details

**How do I get access to customer data?**

In most cases, the customer will either provide a virtual machine to log into (sometimes called a [jump box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_server)) or VPN access. Some very small customers may send you data files.

**Do I host the reports?**

It is very rare for a freelancer or consultant to host the reports. Typically, a customer will provide a PBI license and a workspace to deploy to. Some very small customers (<= 5 employees) may be willing to pay for you to host the reports, but it is rare.

**What license do I need for Power BI?**

Technically, none. If you do all of the development locally with Power BI Desktop and pass back and forth PBIX files, you don’t need any license. I’ve done this with smaller customers, but it should be rare.

To publish, you need a Power BI Pro license, ideally in the tenant you are deploying to. Customers will often provide a temporary account and license.

Short term, you can set up [a free Fabric sandbox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6K4ADjkWjaY) without a business email for learning purposes.

Long term, you’ll want your own domain name, Office 365 tenant, and Power BI Pro license in order to have a personal tenant for demos and proof of concepts. This means you are likely paying for the domain, Office 365 ([E1 or E3](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/office365-plans-and-pricing)), and Power BI Pro. So, roughly $40-60/mo.

# Sales and marketing

**How do I find customers?**

Some people find success on freelance site like Upwork or Fiverr, but unless you live in a part of the world where you can charge very low rates, don’t expect a lot of work. If you build a brand, it’s possible to find some work on places such as LinkedIn. I typically find work from content marketing, word of mouth, and referrals. This is the most work but has the best conversions.

Overall there is a spectrum of trust and social proof. More trust means more work up front but better conversions from leads to sales.

[The spectrum of customer trust](https://preview.redd.it/ep8jn7eheite1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3566cae46bad17e97b44475dce4cf3df9b24940)

**What should my rate be?**

Rate varies greatly by experience and region. In the US, a senior Power BI consultant will charge between $150-300 per hour. Europe is somewhat lower.  
  
Other data points

* [One person on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerBI/comments/1j1sljs/data_analytics_freelancerindependent_consultant/) says they charge $145/hr.
* [One person from France](https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerBI/comments/1hh847b/comment/m2q73ch/) says 50-125€/hr is normal in that country.

As a simple rule of thumb, take your pre-tax salary, divide by 2000 hours, then multiply by 3 to get your hourly rate. If you are working as a side-gig or as a long-term contractor, that multiplier might be 1.5-2x.

There are only two ways to be absolutely sure of what your rate should be for your market. First, develop a set of peers in your industry and ask them what they charge. Second, find enough work so that you can keep raising your rates until people start saying no or pushing back, then go down a bit from there.

If your rate is too low, then you might be [too cheap to trus](https://www.thebusinessofauthority.com/episodes/are-you-too-cheap-to-trust)t. You can also raise your *effective* rate buy doing projects and flat rate billing, but that can be risky.

**How can I find global clients?**

This is extremely difficult. Put yourself in the shoes of the client. International vendors mean more paperwork, different time-zones, and potentially language barriers. There is a much higher hurdle to overcome.

There are two main ways to address this. First is [social proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof). Portfolios, case studies, and testimonials on your website can help to show that you have the relevant skills. Even better are referrals and word-of-mouth but those take time to build.

Second, is hyper-specializing in a [niche](https://www.thebusinessofauthority.com/episodes/five-ways-to-specialize). In a sea of 1,000 alternative vendors, why should they pick you. If you can pick a specialized niche, say Power BI for Dentists or Power BI performance tuning, the people are more likely to find you and less likely to go with a generic option.

**Is it helpful to have the** [PL-300 certification](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/data-analyst-associate/)**?**

As a consultant, no one has ever asked me what certifications I have, because it is high-trust work. If you have less experience or are more of a freelancer starting out, the cert can show you have the bare minimum skills. It’s also worth trying to get if you aren’t sure if you have the technical skills yet.

**How do I sell a dashboard?**

I never sell ""a dashboard"". I think many that do so because that's the most visible tip of the iceberg and the easiest to market. In advertising terms, they are selling the sizzle not the steak. I'm usually trying to deliver some sort of improvement for the business.

My smaller customers usually are looking for one of 3 things when they buy a ""dashboard"":

1. **Proof of concept**. They want a tangible sample report with their own data that lays out how they can start making their own reports.
2. **Lift and shift**. They have some cruddy Excel report they want migrated.
3. **Too busy**. They have the skill set but not the time and need a report migrated or built urgently.

I've never provided any sort of maintenance contract or data refresh/hosting support. Usually I'm dealing with either an IT person not skilled in Power BI or a business user that has been field promoted to learn PBI. My job is to ""teach a man to fish"" in both instances.

# Taking the leap

**How do I know when I’m ready?**

Ideally you should have broad Power BI skills. If you aren't sure, then take the PL-300 to assess if you meet the bare minimum. A strong peer network and good research skills can help supplement your technical knowledge.

You also need an understanding of business so you can help your customers as well as run your own. Finally, you need good people skills and communication skills.

If you aren't sure if you have these skills, consider either starting small with projects on the side, or working for a consulting firm where you will learn a lot. This was the way that I went.

**What paperwork is involved?**

At the beginning, you can start with very little paperwork. But as your work grows, you'll want to protect yourself from legal liability. Long term you will want:

* A [legal entity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_liability_company) (preferably one that provides [liability protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piercing_the_corporate_veil))
* Business Insurance ([General Liability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_general_liability_insurance) and [Errors & Omissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_liability_insurance))
* In the US, you’ll want to research an [S-corp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_corporation) tax election
* A business bank account
* A default [service agreement contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_service_agreement)
* The ability to write up a [scope of work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_of_work)
* The ability to track your time and to send invoices",2025-04-08 01:05:10+00:00,1,1
1ju1gyh,DeltaGreenRPG,Played this and love it,"What's the most active online support group for this?

1ju1gy4,AskEconomics,Is capitalism still relevant in a world where the value of human labour is depreciating?,"As technology is getting more and more advanced, we all know a lot of labor will be replaced by Ai. We expect an emergence of new jobs to fill the void, but the question of the century is- as ai gets more and more developed will the ratio of replacement to emergence be the same. A vast majority of replaced jobs will be low skilled workers and medium skilled workers, which will account for the majority of people. We have no certainty that an equal number of jobs will be created except a past preced of industrial revolution which may not repeat and the baseless optimism of those who have their interests linked with ai.

Communism was a failed ideology. Humans won't work hard if they are not paid in tandem with effort. But capitalism has left a world that is obsessed with money, but it is understandable since our life is linked with money. But if capitalism continues through the ai revolution, we may have few people who can still work, people who own everything, and a group that has a unknown fate whether universal income, transition to entertainment or some meanigless of complicated job.

But what will happen to people who are not skilled enough to do what is not doable by ai?

But lets move onto the question, is capitalism still relevant today, currently i do think there is no good alternative for capitalism, since all communist nations are either market socialist with some like china being more capitalist than socialist. North korea, cuba, and laos are authoritarian and are just a fake democracy. There is no modern democratic communist nation. it's all capitalist. And those that are communist are not truly communist.

Absolute power corrupts absolutely, and any new comunist party that holds power absolutely will never function properly. But if there were multiple parties with equal chance of governance, wouldn't the communist nation have a bare minimum competition for efficency among political parties, hence making it a possible alternative. With modern technology acting as base for the motivationless worker to produce just as much. We may not reach the efficiency of capitalism today, but as technology grows, the practicality of communism grows with it.

If the human race is defined by a need for growth, why isn't that desire for growth allocated to the economic system. Or is it possible that we will never find a better form of running the economy in the next billion years than capitalism. 

Now i have made many assumptions, i may seem biased to communism but i am mostly biased against an eternal capitalistic world, if there is an better economic system that can replace this gross commodification of the world, i just wish for that. We are given a gift of life. We are given a chance to understand ourselves and the universe, to obsess in that period over material wealth seems like a waste. Physical and mental Health should not be a commodity but a service.


Tldr; there is no tldr, i sincerely hope you read this with whatever attention you can gather and engage in discourse.

1ju1gte,Needafriend,"21 m looking for a someone to talk to,","preferably female , i am soo fucking bored, please pm ladies, i swear you won’t regret

Have you ever wondered why pineapples don’t grow on trees or why clocks run clockwise instead of counterclockwise? The universe is full of mysteries, like why we park in driveways and drive on parkways. Speaking of which, if a tomato is technically a fruit, does that mean ketchup is a smoothie? And why do we say ""tuna fish"" but not ""beef mammal""? The world is a strange place, filled with unanswered questions. For instance, why do we press harder on remote controls when the batteries are dying, as if our sheer willpower can somehow revive them? Or why do we nod to say ""yes"" and shake our heads to say ""no""? Could it have been the other way around in an alternate reality? And let’s not even get started on why we call it ""after dark"" when it’s really just ""after light."" The English language is a wild ride—like how ""abbreviation"" is such a long word or how ""phonetically"" isn’t spelled phonetically. Also, why do we sing ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game"" when we’re already there? Shouldn’t it be ""I’m at the Ball Game, Let’s Watch""? And don’t even ask why bread always lands butter-side down. Maybe gravity has a personal vendetta against toast. Either way, life is weird, and the more you think about it, the weirder it gets.  ",2025-04-08 01:04:55+00:00,1,1
1ju1gsj,toddlers,To tablet or not to tablet,"My daughter is turning 4 in two months. My husband and I have always been strict no iPad or tablet type of people. We’ve only let our daughter have an iPad once on a plane somehow, successfully, convinced her the iPad belonged to the airplane so we couldn’t use it outside of it. 

Well now I am at a crossroad. I have kinda been a little more lenient the past few months and let her play the PBS kids games on my phone when we are at appointments or if I have something super important to do for work. It’s pretty rare, maybe once every two weeks or so. BUT when I take the game away she sometimes turns into a demon about it and has fits. Which I’m sure is common among toddlers. 

I am now considering buying her a tablet for a few reasons. She has a ballet recital coming up in May and I just learned they will be backstage for 3 hours. They can’t have any makers, crayons, or anything that can get on their costume before they go on stage. They asked us to send them with their tablets or other activities. Tbh I am not sure what other activity I could send with my 3 year old that doesn’t run the risk of her not getting it all over the costume. Another reason is I know she will be the only one there without a tablet. She is also the only one of her little friends who doesn’t have one. Next reason is we are driving 7 hours to the beach next month as well which I feel a tablet would keep her occupied in the car. 

Would I be making a mistake by buying her one? I can’t help but feel like she will feel left out without one. I am also worried she won’t know how to work one in kindergarten and the elementary schools here utilize tablets constantly. 

Last thing- what tablet would you recommend? I don’t know if I want to pay a ton of $$ for an iPad when it won’t be used much (hopefully). ",2025-04-08 01:04:53+00:00,1,2

Observed TMJ at last dental check up, but no one sounded the alarm or anything. Dental health between poor/fair. 

I know I need to get a dr visit, but looking for insight or tips for the meantime.  Also not sure if I should be going to a gp or a dentist. 

I have ear pain that is on and off throughout the day but seems to be escalating in severity. I noticed a correlation between the ear pain and jaw stiffness/pain on the same side (left). 

Sometimes this pain originates in the back of my tongue on the same side. And this tends to lightning bolt into my throat on the same side as well. 

I am starting to lean on foods that are soft, as my jaw and ear pain are getting worse. For example, I can't take a bite of a burger without doing a ton of finagling and still having pain. 

I'm finishing my undergrad in the next 5 weeks, have an internship, am working, and have a family to care for. So, I know that I'm likely grinding from stress when I'm sleeping. And when I catch myself clenching my jaw during the day, I'm making a point to relax it.

Anything other than extra strength otc pain meds? I can't max out on ibuprofen for the next five weeks. But sometimes the pain is persistent enough that I just have to take a nap because I feel it draining me. 

Is this a run, don't walk to the doc kind of thing? If so, which doc? Or can I limp through until graduation in 5 weeks?

Session and scenes have VC and PbP options depending on the DM running the aforementioned session/scene. We are working our way up to two sessions a week, and plenty of options away from sessions like settlements and factions.

In 2287, the Boston Commonwealth was held in the vice of fear and paranoia. The Institute was the proverbial boogeyman. Like the Fey of ancient mythos, anyone could be taken and replaced by an artificial replica under the Institute's control. Families were now faced with harsh reality that their loved ones may have been replaced with synths, who acted and looked just like normal people.  
The Minuteman to a man after the Quincy massacre, leaving the average citizen without protection and support. Raiders and super mutants ruled the streets, with only the stupid or brave would dare to risk leaving their settlements.   
Then, one day not long after the Quincy massacre, an event came to shake up the wasteland. An ancient Vault Dweller rose from cyro-stasis to search for his son. The events that followed happened in rapid succession. He built a small community with the last surviving members of the Minuteman in Sanctuary Hills. The Brotherhood of Steel sent the Prydwen to end the threat of the Institute. With the help of the Railroad, an anti-Institute and pro-synth group, the Survivor was able to launch an assault with the help of the Minutemen. After an intense struggle, the Minutemen emerged victorious and the threat of the Institute seemed to be no more.   
The next threat was the animosity built between the surviving factions of the Brotherhood, Railroad and the Minutemen. It was the hard work of the Vault Dweller that kept the Commonwealth from another war on a grand scale and a truce was formed.

It has been three years since the battle of Cambridge and the truce was formed. The year is 2290. Sanctuary Hills has been a stalwart bastion of the Vault Dweller's ongoing vision, with it's development bolstered by the power of Vault 111 and the Minutemen. Synths now roam the Commonwealth without fear of the Institute, but lingering doubts remain and more disruptive threats exist for the androids. The Brotherhood still roams the Wasteland looking for new technology, even if they cannot actively hunt down the Synths. An offshoot has developed, the Brotherhood Outcasts who cannot tolerate the truce of three years ago and may have planned actions to further their ideals. A bold and ambitious group known as the New Californian Republic has managed to set up an outpost in the Commonwealth, to setup trade ostensibly. The Railroad has found new causes to campaign for with the Super Mutant, Ghoul and Synth populations of the Commonwealth, still pitting them against the Brotherhood and their exiles.

OPRAH’S BOOK CLUB PICK • An astonishing memoir that explores how far we will go to protect ourselves, and the healing made possible when we face our secrets and begin to share our stories


For decades, Amy ran. Through the dirt roads of Amarillo, Texas, where she grew up; to the campus of the University of Virginia, as a student athlete; on the streets of New York, where she built her adult life; through marriage, motherhood, and a thriving career. To outsiders, it all looked, in many ways, perfect. But Amy was running from something—a secret she was keeping not only from her family and friends, but unconsciously from herself. “You’re here, but you’re not here,” her daughter said to her one night. “Where are you, Mom?” So began Amy’s quest to solve a mystery trapped in the deep recesses of her own memory—a journey that would take her into the burgeoning field of psychedelic therapy, to the limits of the judicial system, and ultimately, home to the Texas panhandle, where her story began.

In her search for the truth, to understand and begin to recover from buried childhood trauma, Griffin interrogates the pursuit of perfectionism, control, and maintaining appearances that drives so many women, asking, when, in our path from girlhood to womanhood, did we learn to look outside ourselves for validation? What kind of freedom is possible if we accept the whole story and embrace who we really are? With hope, heart, and relentless honesty, she points a way forward for all of us, revealing the power of radical truth-telling to deepen our connections—with others and ourselves.

1ju1gex,AmIOverreacting,AIO my mother has treated me like shit ever since I got into an accident,"Because I'm at a bad place in life, I unfortunately live with my mother, as I have nowhere else to go (I have an ESA and would never part with her, and refuse to trust shared housing). I also borrow her backup car. Back in november, I went out to run an errand, not knowing how terrible the weather was. It was a whiteout storm. By the time I realized I wasnt going to make it to my destination, I was already out a few miles from my house. So I turned back around and slowly made my way back home. On a downhill slope, an amazon truck had gotten stuck, and there was nowhere for me to go, as there was an 8 foot drop on either side, so I slammed on my brakes as much as I could and hit the Amazon truck straight on. My knee was injured in the accident to the point I couldn't walk without assistance, and had to use a cane. It still bothers me today, and it hurts going up and down stairs or exercising. I called my mom in the ambulance crying, and I told her I'd been in an accident. She just sighed disappointedly and told me to call the insurance company. As an afterthought, she asked if I was fine, and then hung up. She treated me horribly since then. The next day, she was going to the store. So I asked her to pick me up something from there and said I'd pay for it. She got very angry and said no, she didn't want to spend time picking up the item. Then she snapped and said ""its not MY fault you crashed the car!"" And I burst into tears. I couldnt believe she not only didnt care that I was injured or could have potentially died, but that she was happy to hold it over my head. I offered to pay for the damage, but she still brings it up and says she's still angry about it. Am I overreacting about being really hurt by her reactions?",2025-04-08 01:04:20+00:00,2,0

One such game-changing tool is the [**CNFANS Spreadsheet**](https://cnfanspreadsheet.co/shop?type=T-Shirt), a modern-day spreadsheet solution built for speed, collaboration, and precision. While spreadsheets have long been a staple in both professional and personal life, CNFANS takes this classic concept and elevates it to meet today’s expectations. It’s designed not just for data entry, but for **strategic thinking, automation, and cross-team collaboration**, all while remaining intuitive for anyone to use.

What sets CNFANS apart is its **perfect balance between simplicity and sophistication**. The platform provides a clean, clutter-free interface that anyone can navigate, but it’s also packed with high-powered features like conditional logic, advanced formulas, and multi-sheet linking. CNFANS users can create smart dashboards, build dynamic reports, or analyze complex datasets without switching between tools. It’s perfect for startups needing agile tools or departments within larger enterprises looking to cut down on time and confusion. With CNFANS, what used to take hours can be done in minutes—and with fewer errors.

Another strong point of CNFANS is its focus on **real-time collaboration and cloud accessibility**. Teams can share spreadsheets across locations and time zones, and changes are instantly visible to all users. Built-in chat and commenting allow for smoother conversations within the document itself, removing the need for endless email threads. Managers can assign different access levels—viewer, commenter, editor—ensuring the right people have the right permissions. And since it's cloud-based, there’s no worry about losing work due to system crashes or device limitations.

In addition to everyday use, CNFANS Spreadsheet brings a new level of **automation and intelligence** to the spreadsheet world. Users can schedule data refreshes, integrate with other business tools (like Slack, Google Analytics, or payment platforms), and even set up rules that trigger alerts or updates automatically. This means repetitive tasks, such as updating inventory or generating weekly reports, can run in the background without manual input. For those who like to dive deeper, CNFANS supports scripting for custom workflows, offering even more control and customization.

At its heart, CNFANS Spreadsheet is about **empowering users to make smarter decisions with less friction**. It gives individuals and teams the ability to focus on insights rather than inputs, to collaborate in harmony rather than chaos, and to scale their data solutions without needing an IT department. In a time where agility and data accuracy are crucial for success, CNFANS provides a platform that’s both powerful and approachable. It’s not just a spreadsheet—it’s your team’s new best friend in the digital workspace.",2025-04-08 01:03:14+00:00,1,0

1ju1fly,fender,My Fender Mustang GTX100 has been completely crashing and going silent while playing recently.,"I bought this for myself new from Guitar Center around Christmas time 2024. I ran into a few brief instances of it crashing, but I found a quick fix online where folks recommended turning off the WiFi and Bluetooth while not using them, and the problem seemed to disappear. I also had a brief issue where the screen glitched slightly and left these weird shadowed elements on the display. Still very readable, but just visually left some strange artifacts. Restarting the amp immediately fixed it.

All of a sudden this past week, the amp has started completely crashing again while playing. It's happened maybe 20 minutes into me practicing, every day for the last 3 or 4 days now. I've tried using the update function, but no updates seem to be available, and the software seems to be on the current version.

I'm starting to get very worried that I've made a big mistake getting this amp. I love all the effects that it comes with, but I absolutely cannot have this amp shutting off randomly during a potential rehearsal or gig in the future.

What should I do about this? Has anyone else run into this problem?",2025-04-08 01:03:10+00:00,2,3
1ju1fhw,StartUpIndia,"Dear Piyush Goyal — Startup Mahakumbh is Great, But Try Running a Startup","I started a software company in 2019 with nothing but ambition and a laptop. Fast forward to today I have grown to 50 employees, created jobs, paid my taxes, and stayed compliant. And what’s my reward?

The bigger I grow, the thinner my margins become. Why? Because the system is rigged to suck the blood out of small business owners like me.

Let’s break it down:

I import software licenses to resell. Thanks to RCM, I pay GST on every license I import. But guess what? I can’t claim that back unless I have a GST invoice to set it off against. So, all that money? Just parked with the government.

Then there’s TDS. A cool 10% cut on top of my sale. Let's say I buy a license for ₹100 and sell it for ₹110. Boom — ₹11 gone as TDS. Add RCM and my actual cost is already higher than my selling price. I literally need to fund the transaction from my own pocket.

And if I somehow survive all this, Income Tax is waiting at the end of the tunnel. So from every rupee of profit, I’m left scrambling to keep the lights on.

All the “ease of doing business” we keep hearing about? Try being an actual small IT business owner and you’ll know. I’m not asking for handouts. Just stop bleeding us dry.

Is this how we expect Indian startups to thrive?",2025-04-08 01:03:01+00:00,3,0

1ju1ez2,Hair,i am struggling with my hair.,"i know this is quite long, but TLDR, i need help with taking care of/styling my greasy, thin and long straight hair.

i have straight 1A hair that is reaching my elbows in lenght. my hair strands are very thin and i have lots of hair on my head (in amount). also, it is extremely greasy. if i don't wash at least every other day, it looks disgusting, like someone has gone without washing their hair for 2 weeks. also it gets tangled so easily, like when im brushing my hair, if i have done the left side first, as i brush the right side the left becomes tangled and i have to go over it again. even after just brushing all of my hair througly, i cant run my hand through it without it getting stuck. when i go out if there is a slight wind, my hair gets tangled and knotted.

it also holds absolutely no style, if i use heated or heatless curling methods, doesn't really matter, it looks somewhat wavy for about 10 minutes, and it starts to straighten immediately, in about 1 hour it goes back to being completely straight, even if i try very hard to keep them.

i can't do any hairstyles because as i mentioned, it gets knotted very easily and when i try to do any style it becomes a mess and very difficult to navigate, so i just let it stay untied, or put it up with a claw clip if i have to. putting my hair up in a ponytail/bun with a hair tie hurts my scalp so much and i feel extreme weight pulling down so i can't use hair ties or scrunchies to tie my hair up.

also i want to note that my hair has never been dyed before, never bleached, never got a perm or any kind of chemical put on it (i guess other than shampoo), and i have not used heat in years as it proved fruitless, i have not bothered. i try to keep my hair healthy as i fear the state of it would become worse if i dye it for example, though i don't know, i haven't tried it as i said.

i really want to have long hair as i have tried various short haircuts before and all of them look very unflattering on my face, i also like the look of long hair a lot more. but taking care of my hair and styling it is so hard that i am at a loss at what to do. i am on the verge of losing my sanity and shaving it all. (if i knew it would look good, i wouldn't even hesitate a second but i know it won't)

does anyone know what to do in this situation, have suggestions, or if you have a similar hair type, how do you deal with it?

please help me.

————————————————————————————————————————————————————

**Helmet supplemental recording REF#9887674315 /Pabenko/:**





The footage showed a Venlil paw holding a holopad with what appeared to be journal entries, slowly scanning the text from top to bottom as he sat by the bonfire, a calm atmosphere only with the crackling sound of the burning wood and the peaceful chatter of the soldiers... A peace that didn’t last long.



“WWWAAAOOUUUHHH!!!”



What sounded like howls echoed throughout the hill, from the limited protection offered by the few surrounding trees. Most of what appeared to be a wild predatory call concentrated to the east where the vegetation was somewhat denser.







Alerted by the sound, Pabenko carefully tucked his journal into a breast pocket of his uniform, grabing his weapon not far from him as everyone else did the same, looking around for threats, whether wild predators of the night... or Arxur.







“What was that? Predators?” Raomi said, checking his light machine gun with a determined look.



“What else would you believe that is, huh?” Biira said sarcastically, but struggling to get the words out in fear but remaining firm. Both positioned themselves toward the source of the sound.





Cadet Ubim, on the other hand, was figuratively shitting himself, looking like he might stampede at any moment, his paws shaking as he barely held onto his service rifle.



“I-is the A-Arxur? H-here? N-now?” Ubim was practically waving his gun to any dark place, which was everywhere, even looking up at the sky a couple of times.



“Calm down, boys! Hold your fire until you see something in the clearing,” the unit’s sergeant burst in to restore order.



The camera alternated between looking down the hill to the south and at the members of his squad, while his sergeant turned to the team of exterminator currently covering the north and west sides of the small hill with their weapons.



“Do you see anything over there?” Sergeant Thoram asked the second squad, who had already quickly donned their masks, now appearing to be a single entity silently maintaining disciplined surveillance, likely maintaining closed radio communication. The human was the only one with his face more or less uncovered, with the exception of the visor.



“Nothing” the alien predator spoke only a single growl.





The sergeant ordered in a low voice, his gaze alert to his surroundings. “Keep quiet... if you can’t see anything... listen.”





The moments of tension and absolute silence grew ever more intense, as everyone looked intently at their flank, pointing their weapons, half of both teams facing east, while the rest formed the rest of the circle, keeping watch their outward.



No matter how little the clock actually moved, the wait dragged on and on, without a sound, neither from any civilized being nor from nature.



Something began to be heard to the east, with the nearby trees slightly muffling the noise, but it sounded like human screams in the distance.



“I-it’s the human, h-has she gone crazy?” The cadet couldn’t hold his mouth shut for another second.



“Shh, be quiet,” Thim commanded.



The screams died down for a few seconds, but more noises were heard from the eastern grove, indistinguishable for the moment, but it was undoubtedly movement, drawing most of the attention... and weapons to that direction.



The screams were heard again, at the same time the human could be seen emerging from the bushes in a sprint, screaming in panic like a motherless cub in danger.



An Arxur was chasing behind the human! about to pounce on her! she couldn’t react as her pursuer charged at her, falling on top of her body.



The camera Venlil pointed his weapon at the scaled beast as it extended a claw upward to deliver a killing blow to her neck. But his intention to fire was interrupted by the sound of shot to his left and the sight of the Arxur’s head exploding into pieces.



Turning his gaze, Pabenko saw the culprit, one of the Venlil exterminators had a marksman rifle with its smoking barrel, probably saving the life of his human companion, by being the fastest and most accurate of all those present at that moment.



Her gaze returned to the downhill where the human was removing the Arxur corpse from that was on top of her body, climbing to the top of the hill, still letting out small cries of despair.



When the predator reached the top, she practically collapsed to her knees, shocked and covered in the Arxur’s red blood, everyone’s attention was on her, save for a few who were still watching the way she had come.



“Ahh!... Arxur! It’s them! We’re going to die!” the human screamed her words, covering her head with her hands as if death were coming for her to reap her soul... which wasn’t exactly incorrect.



“WWWAAAOOUUUHHH!!!”



Another collective howl was heard again, this time much closer, mainly from the east but also approaching from the north and south towards their position, undoubtedly with the intention of intimidating them.



Pabenko’s gaze shifted eastward, creating a line of fire with his comrades, his weapon pivoting on any possible path up to their position, hearing his sergeant shout orders.



“Hold the position! Watch the flanks! Don’t let them surround us! ...And you, human! Stand up and fight!”



Aiming at the vegetation at the foot of the hill, the bushes were moving, with little more than movement visible in the darkness. Three arxurs emerged from the gloom directly in front of them, practically running up the hill.



“There!” Raomi shouted, opening fire with his machine gun in bursts, shooting one down immediately. Both Pabenko and Biira fired their weapons to take out their targets, managing to take down the other two with a handful of accurate shots. However, there was more movement in the vegetation.



Raomi shouted again, “More, there’s more!” and began to lay down suppressive fire throughout the area, but without much effect. without even an approximation of where they were, there was shadowy movement everywhere! The Arxur began to return fire, preferring long-range combat now that they knew they were defending themselves.



The bullets began to fly toward them, forcing them to take cover further along the edge of the ridge. One bullet passed close to gunner Raomi, shattering a piece of rock next to him, interrupting his suppressive fire.



“Shit!” The impact caused Raomi to crawl back to avoid being so exposed.



The soldiers on the northern and southern flanks began firing occasionally, indicating they were beginning to be surrounded, but they were unable to hit them with their weapons due to the cloak of the night.



Unable to do much, Pabenko turned around, assessing the situation in search of some guidance. The flames of the fire revealed their location and barely reached the foot of the hill. But without it, the enemy would be upon them. They were basically doomed, unable to advance or retreat anywhere. The Arxur troops were closing in like a giant jaw...





“Flares! Use Flares!” The male human roared an order.





His masked prey comrades in the rear began to light up multiple red flares and throw them around the hill, creating a perimeter where the silhouettes of their enemies could be distinguished.



“There they are! Take them down before they take cover!” The sergeant motivated his squad to take advantage of the opportunity and so they did.





Raomi resumed his suppressive fire, this time able to alleviate much of the counterfire on the main flank and prevented the enemies from running back and forth unpunished.



The rest of the team was able to begin shooting down unsuspecting Arxurs without cover and were finally able to take advantage of the height. Even Ubim mustered the courage to take shots aiming his weapon and not just raise it above cover.



Pabenko himself aimed and fired at any silhouettes that appeared to be of the Infernal Predators, taking down two in quick succession, but a burst from a third grazed his ears. When he turned around, he realized the Arxur already had him locked onto, leaving him no time to react, but...



A burst of gunfire right next to him took him by surprise, deafening him in one ear. It was the human Marisha! who gived cover fire, shooting down the grey that was about to kill him.  
  


He turns around in disbelief to find the predator by his side, a predator who still had a slightly shocked face from before, but when he looked at her, she came out of her trance and smiled at him for a brief moment before firing her gun again.





“Go to the sergeant. I got this. He wants you there.”



As Marisha assumes a prone position, Pabenko’s camera pans toward the inside of the circle and walks toward the sergeant, who was standing with Thim on the western edge, a flank the Grays hadn’t yet occupied.



When he arrived, the sergeant placed a paw on his shoulder. “Son, I have a special mission for you. The Arxur have stalled. It doesn’t look like they have the numbers for a direct attack since we have the height advantage, but we still have to break their siege.”



Pabenko Glancing to his side, it could be seen that neither side was using intense fire, but rather it was a shootout with only occasional shots and bursts.





“We must take the initiative to drive those beasts back to their burrows, so you, Thim, and that strange human exterminator will go down this flank and open the enclosure they’re trapping us in, killing as many of them as possible!” The sergeant concluded his explanation by pounding a fist into his palm.





Pabenko and Thim began to descend the relatively safe slope, trying to remain as unnoticed as possible. Just beyond the foot of the hill, the male human was already waiting for them, crouching between a couple of trees.



“Brahk... I can barely see a thing” Thim couldn’t help but complain about the almost incapacitating darkness they had entered, also voicing Pabenko’s thoughts.



“Be more quiet, creature, don’t talk so loud...” the human replied in a rumbling whisper.



“I wasn’t! Hmm... I wasn’t talking loudly...” Thim raised his voice stubbornly and quickly realizing his mistake.



“Be that as it may, be quiet and listen. We’ll have to work together. The Grays won’t see us coming, but we’ll have to be stealthy.”



“Of course that’s the plan...” Thim said with a tired look.",2025-04-08 01:02:03+00:00,1,1

1ju1err,hvacadvice,Is my 1999 HVAC system cooling?,"Selling our home that we've been in for the past 15 years. The HVAC system is original to the house - 1999. 

About 7-8 years ago, at the recommendation (and our agreement) of the person doing our annual HVAC maintenance, we decided to just let it ride, not put any more mainteance dollars into it, and when it died, we'd get a new system since we knew we were living on borrowed time. Every year or two, it would struggle to cool at the beginning of the warm season, and we'd pop a new $10 run capacitor in, and it carried on like a champ through the summer (and we regularly top 100 degrees here in NC). Fast forward to now, we're selling the house and never had to replace the HVAC. Obviously, the dated HVAC system was a known ""downside"" to an otherwise excellently maintained and updated home, and clearly wasn't a deterrent to buyers as we got 6 offers on the house.

We moved out of the house in December, and put the house on the market a few weeks ago, quickly going under contract. The AC hasn't been run since before we moved out (probably since October), until the inspection this week. The inspection report noted that ""The system did respond to thermostat controls, however, the temperature did not drop to a normal operating range"", accompanied by a photo of a thermometer at an air vent, showing 57.4 degrees. <There was no photo or documentation of the temperature at a return vent. The outside temperature on the inspection report was noted to be ""60-70 degrees"" that day.>

Now, the buyers are asking for a credit for the HVAC. I'm trying to determine if, based on what's in the inspection report, is it actually not cooling much? Or is it just not cooling ""as much as a perfectly-working system should cool?""  If it's truly not cooling, then I'm more inclined to agree to a small credit. But if it's just ""not perfect""....well, they knew when making the offer that this was a 26 year old system, so...kick rocks.

Thanks to anyone who read all of that and can weigh in!

1ju1eio,joannalopez,Why so many airings?,"I had taken a break from checking for updates, and just popped back to this sub to read that Joanna’s slide aired four times!

Some hypothetical questions that I’d love to hear opinions on:

1) I always read that the second airing was a mistake. In fact, I believe someone confirmed this with WMAQ quite awhile ago. Someone put in an old master tape with Joanna’s slide, realized what they had done, and pulled it after a few seconds. Not sure how the filing system worked then at broadcast stations, but wouldn’t the editor try to avoid another error by placing the tape somewhere it wouldn’t be accidentally grabbed again… and again, and again?

2) Do we know if WMAQ would typically only run one missing side a night - or was Joanna’s situation an anomaly? 

3) I’ve lived in Chicago for 25 years, and can attest that a lot of people go missing here - some for only a short time, and some seemingly without a trace. There’s somewhat of an epidemic of women of color disappearing on the south and west sides of our city. I’d think there would be no shortage of “Missing” PSAs to run, even in the late 80s and early 90s. Why did they keep returning to Joanna? One replay could be an accident, but three definitely seems deliberate. ",2025-04-08 01:01:39+00:00,2,0
1ju1ei5,bayarea,Has H-Mart alway been this expensive?!,"I've always been shopping with different Asian grocery stores, never really had a strong preference nor paid close attention to the prices, and I've always assumed the Japanese ones are slightly more expensive and higher quality while the Korean and Chinese ones are generally more affordable.

So I just went to the H-Mart on De Anza for grocery run, and I'm kinda shocked by the prices: no-brand medium white eggs for ~$11/dozen, baby back ribs for $11/lb. like WTF??? For reference, the most expensive egg in my nearby whole foods is Vital Farms some blue shit for ~$11/dozen, and the ribs is $7.5/lb from Ranch.

1ju1dts,Wildfire,FEMA Needs to Be Led by Federal Emergency Responders — For the Sake of Incident Management,"In an era defined by megafires, superstorms, and cascading disasters, the most critical component of emergency response isn’t just policy — it’s incident management. And that’s exactly where FEMA continues to fall short.

Rather than being a nimble, field-savvy agency driven by those who actually manage crises on the ground, FEMA has become a reactive instead of proactive coordinating group, instead of leading. The people best equipped to lead FEMA into the future aren’t political appointees. They’re federal emergency responders — the incident commanders, logistics chiefs, operations leaders, finance, and boots-on-the-ground personnel who actually run disasters.

If we want FEMA to function as the nation’s premier disaster response agency, then it should be led by the very people who understand incident management at its core.

Real-world incident management requires experience, instinct, and constant decision-making under pressure. It’s the art of controlling chaos — organizing resources, assigning roles, anticipating failure points, and adapting on the fly.

Federal emergency responders do this every day. They’ve stood up incident command posts in burning forests, hurricane zones, and flooded towns, as well as ground zero. They understand span of control, unity of command, operational tempo, and the real difference between a plan and a mission. 
FEMA too often acts like a middleman — facilitating contracts and grants while relying heavily on state and local agencies to do the real work. 

Disasters don’t wait for memos or interagency meetings. The longer it takes to stand up an effective incident organization, the greater the human and economic cost. Putting seasoned federal responders — those from the U.S. Forest Service, BLM, National Park Service, and other land and fire management agencies — in charge of FEMA is the key. 

These responders have experience leading Type 1 and Type 2 incidents — the most complex, resource-intensive, multi-jurisdictional events this country sees. They know how to build scalable teams, manage large operations, and stay calm when everything is falling apart. That’s exactly who FEMA needs at at the top. 

FEMA should have a model where every regional office had its own incident management team — not just liaisons and coordinators, but full-scale IMTs led by seasoned responders. FEMA logistics being run by people who’ve actually managed supply chains into remote, disaster-impacted areas. Unified command that’s truly unified — not a patchwork of overlapping authorities and unclear responsibilities.

When the command structure works, everything downstream improves: resource ordering, communications, public information, and even intergovernmental cooperation. Better incident management means faster responses, more lives saved, and less confusion in the most critical hours.

IMO, This should be a considered federal response. ",2025-04-08 01:00:49+00:00,3,2
1ju1dn4,attackontitan,Custom 4 Titans. Wanting thoughts and opinions,"So the long and short is I'm making a dnd campaign based on aot. There will be 4 new titans. I want your guys thoughts on

- if they fit aot
- they aren't pulling bullshit that doesn't make sense
- originality
- if they are distinct from the existing 9
- are distinct from the other custom 4
- are actually useful and do their role


Please be honest if they are bad since I want them to be accurate. As well, before reading the titans abilities read their name and guess what's special about the titan (the armoured titan has armour, the colossal Titan is big, the attack titan is good at attacking). I want the names to follow a similar format to the original.

(Minor spoilers I suppose? Won't spoil the story, only mentioning titans and their abilities as well how we've seen titan stuff interact with other Titans)



1. Skeletal Titan

A 20 meter tall titan that has the appearance of being a skeleton, barely any fat or muscle.

This Titan is slow, and doesn't hit hard at all. Due to the lack of anything this titan is incredibly energy efficient able to stay in titan form for 5 days with training. This titan also heals ridiculously fast.


Ability wise, the titan is made up of titan hardening that's built fibrous like a tree almost and is prone to splintering.

Upon splintering the titan won't remove the splinters rather it'll keep them, this is because when a splinter stabs into another titan, so long as the splinter remains in contact with a titan, it'll spread the hardening locking the attacker in place. This effect will persist till contact with the splinter  is lost.

This titan can also cause an uneven growth of hardening on its body, this will build pressure and upon reaching critical pressure it'll explode sending ""bone"" shards flying around, this does sacrifice that body part however.

Lastly the titan can cause the growth all over it's body, this will act as a ""suicide"" bomb of sorts, if the Skeletal Titan is grappling another titan and does this, the grappled titan will get completely locked in place forcing both the Skeletal Titan and the grappled to re-enter their titan forms.

Abilities summerized

- can spread titan hardening locking titans in place

- can explode limbs give range
- can explode entire body


(For number 2. There are spoilers to a character in invincible, show watchers you've be warned. This character is in the newest season)




2. The Battle Ram Titan

This titan is a 16 meter tall unit. It's built similarly to Conquest from invincible. This titan is alright on energy efficiency, it's total energy supply is less than average however. This titan can ""burn"" away it's muscle and use that to replenish it's energy or act as an intense adrenaline rush at the cost of lowering strength. It's muscle is replenished on transformation.

Ability wise

This titan can selectively harden 3 limbs (I define a limb differently for homebrew dnd rules. There's 10 recognized limbs).

This hardening is essentially 10x stronger than usual hardening, 10x as dense and thicker as well, this hardening is basically indestructible to that worlds time. It can also use the hardening as a weapon to hit things really hard. (It can't hardening the nape for gameplay reasons)

The Titan also has such high muscle built up that if it ""burns"" the muscle it takes a bit to actually loose a problematic amount of muscle. the muscle can act as a speed boost, healing speed boost, as well as replenish it's energy, this will make the titans strength weaker.

The Titan will often go far away and harden it's fist, then charge through enemy lines. (Hence the name Battle Ram titan)


To summerize

- incredibly strong hardening that can be used as a club of sorts or ram.

- can burn it's muscle for energy or speed.

- (this wasn't mentioned but the titan can only cover a limb with the hardening. It cant use it to make actual weapons. Think Hellboys arm from Hellboy. Thats how it uses the arm as a weapon)



3. (New) The Blitzkrieg Titan

The Blitzkrieg Titan is a 14 meter tall slimmer titan. This titan has a high energy use and lower total energy. This titan has what appears to be braces of sorts made of hardening on its limbs, the defense these offer are minimum and used more to prevent it from break itself.


Ability wise


- this titan can control it's steam release in such a way that it boosts itself. This means the titan is among the fastest in a sprint, it will use the released steam to accelerate its attacks, it can also boost itself to run faster (think Tenya from My Hero Academia).

(WIP subject to change) - the titan might have reactive hardening. This means that the area will harden in response to pain, this would have the potential to lock the titan when struck. This ability is still a work in progess and is very subject to change.


To summerize

- this titan can release steam anywhere to boost itself. This steam won't be used like the colossal titans. 

- the braces are there to prevent the titan from breaking itself with the speeds this titan can travel.

- the reactive hardening is a work in progress. It will harden automatically when struck however the titan doesn't have control over it making the titan subject to locking itself.



4. The Puppeteer Titan 


This titan is a 10 meter tall genaric titan, this titan has a high total energy but also a high energy cost. The titan itself heals at a normal rate.


Ability wise


- this titan can use a cable like structure attached to itself that makes a titan puppet of sorts. These puppets are made of hardening thats softer and they can't heal. These puppets are attached to the Puppeteer titan via cable like the warhammer titan, this cable can be broken making the puppets become inactive.

The puppets take a bit to make but the Puppeteer Titan has complete control over the puppets meaning they can coordinate incredibly well.

The puppets are limited to 

- 6 ""mindless"" puppets. These puppets are built like mindless titans, meaning on average they are 6 meters tall and full of deformities. 

- 3 well made puppets. These puppets are built like pure titans that have minimal deformities. On average are 10-13 meters tall.

- 2 special puppets. These puppets can be any one of the 9 titans as well as my 4 custom however they don't possess abilities of the titans just the physical qualities. These puppets can also be custom made puppets that haven't been shown in the anime nor manga (such as a puppet having 4 arms or something)

- 1 colossal sized titan. This is quite self explanatory. This puppet is sized as the colossal titan however it doesn't get the nuke nor steam ability. This is the most energy costing puppet. This puppet takes 3-6 minutes to make.


The puppets are based around a cost system. Mindless puppets are the cheapest. The Puppeteer titan can only have a max number of puppets equal to six mindless puppets.

1 colossal puppet = 6 mindless puppets
1 specialized puppets = 3 mindless puppets
1 well built puppet = 2 mindless puppets

To summerize

- the Puppeteer Titan can create puppets that are controlled via cable. If the cable is broken the puppet is deactivated and the Puppeteer titan must make another one. The puppets are flawlessly controlled by the Puppeteer titan. The Puppeteer titan is incredibly vulnerable however.




The custom titans roles are

- Skeletal Titan
Battlefield controller. Controls the pace of battle

- Battle Ram Titan
Supposed to be a defensive titan. A defensive titan that smashes through defenses

- Blitzkrieg Titan 
A speed demon that is pure offense, the titan is supposed to be able to blitz through enemies.

- Puppeteer Titan
A jack of all trades but master of none. Supposed to fill every role that was missed.


These are my ideas I have thought of. I have a few more that were cut because I didn't like how they turned out. Please let me know your thoughts as well as adjustments you'd make.

Also don't be affraid to ask questions.
(Credit where credit is due my friend came up with the new Blitzkrieg titan ideas)

1ju1d6i,blackops6,My Issues with Battlenet and BO6,"Hey guys, I bought BO6 back on release in 2024 and the game continuously suffered from crashes and stutters - eventually leading to me just uninstalling and never touching this god forsaken game. Ever since **Verdansk** came back, I decided I should try again to play with a couple buddies. As expected, the game will not even run anymore. It gets to 6% shaders and completely crashes my entire PC. 

  
A quick note, back in October 2024, i contacted battlenet to make them aware of this issue, they offered a few basic troubleshooting tips that I tried and did not work. At the time, my pc was running a Z690, i9 12900k, 3060, 16GB of ram, 1 tb SSD, with ethernet. As of the time of this post, I am now running a 5080 Astral, x870e Crosshair, 9800x3d, 64GB 6000mhz ram, 2 TB SSD, and ethernet with another ISP. The game will still not work.

  
I contacted their support again, still not help. All I got was the usual scripts that they are copying and pasting and refuse to assist me. I was curious and bought the game from steam (to ensure its not actually my PC), and guess what! It works! No issues, no stutters, no tearing, no crashing. It runs stable the way the game is supposed to operate. Unfortunately only took thousands of dollars to get to this point, however, I did come to the conclusion that battlenet is probably the worst launcher i have ever used. I will never recommend them to anyone and will never use their ""Ddos"" servers again. 

please take this with a grain of salt, I was already planning on upgrading my PC and changing ISP's - I will also note, my friend on Battle also had a similar issue. However, he just purchased on steam and hasn't faced any issues yet. This may just be bad luck - but wow battlenet and their representatives are a nightmare to deal with.",2025-04-08 01:00:00+00:00,1,0

1ju1czo,techsupport,Experiencing severe stuttering on new PC,"Hello!

First of all: I am sorry for my really terrible english! I also hope that I used the right flair!

I have recently bought a new high-end PC (I will list the parts below) and overall I am very happy. But I encounter severe stuttering issues in some games, making some of them nearly unplayable. I have played some of these games on my old PC before and they were playable back then, but now I am encountering these FPS-drops.



Specs:

CPU: Ryzen 7 9800X3D

GPU: Gigabyte RTX 5080 Gaming OC

RAM: 2x32GB Kingston 6000MHZ CL36-38-38-80 (KF560C36BBEK2-64)

Mainboard: ASUS TUF Gaming B850-Plus-Wifi

Cooler: MSI A13 360

PSU: MSI A850GL (850W, ATX 3.1)

SSD: Kingston NV2 1TB

OS: Windows 11



So, these are my specs. I will now explain the stutters and frame drops for each game I tested in more detail because they are not the same in every game and some games dont seem to be affected by this problem:



Arma 3: noticeable and measurable framedrops maybe once a minute, otherwise good average FPS (Way above 100 FPS, most of the time, depending on the map, above 145FPS) at 4K, max settings

Subnautica: noticeable and measurable framedrops depending on what you are doing in the game, framedrops especially when moving around the map and going into new areas (for example when you go near the island), otherwise good average FPS (about 160 FPS) at 4K, max settings

Transport Fever 2: heavy stuttering every few seconds, unplayable, especially when moving over the map or zooming in, FPS drop to 10 - 15 FPS, 4K, max settings (I have been able to play this game before without any stuttering)

Cities Skylines: heavy stuttering every few seconds, nearly unplayable, gets worse then the simulation is running, stuttering when moving over the map or zooming in, FPS drop to 10 - 15 FPS, 4K max Settings (I have tested 2K and FHD, with lowest settings and I still get heavy stuttering, also on empty maps. I have been able to play the game before without these stutters)

MSFS2024: irregular framedrops at 4K High - Ultra Settings, probably caused by the bad optimization of the game

Modern Warfare 3: No noticeable stutters. High average FPS.

Minecraft: heavy stuttering when flying over the map, no stuttering in a flat map, stuttering is better when render and simulation distance is reduced (Stuttering mainly occurs when both is set to 32), stuttering can be partly fixed by using some Java arguments in the launcher

Stray: good average FPS, irregular but noticeable and annoying stutters sometimes, 4K, max settings

Hearts of Iron: unplayable, heavy stuttering, very unstable framerates, framedrops to very low FPS (I have been able to play this game before without any stuttering)

Planet Coaster: Average FPS with a medium-sized park at around 112 FPS, sometimes the FPS are dropping down to 60 FPS, the framerate is very unstable, feels very unsmooth even though the FPS dont go below 60, 4k, max settings

Civilization VI: Good average FPS, but drops down to 80 FPS sometimes, tested on a new save. 4K, max settings

Fortnite: I have not measured the FPS with any tool here, but there were noticeable framedrops at 4K, max Settings, especially when loading into a game (the loading time was very long) and when driving around the map with a car, the stutters got better with time and after some rounds the stutters were gone.

  
What I have tried so far:

- Setting the Windows power option from balanced to high power.

- EXPO on/off

- Resetting BIOS to default multiple times

- Updating BIOS to the latest version (Version 1022)

- Installing newest driver for LAN, Bluetooth, WLAN and USB from the ASUS website (I am not sure if some of the drivers have been installed correctly, as nothing has happend when I tried to install them besides a command prompt opening for a small amount of time)

- Downloading latest chipset driver from the AMD-Website

- Downloading latest GPU-Driver from the NVIDIA-Website

- Doing a reinstall of Windows 11 with cleaning up the SSD 

- I have tried to use an older version of the GPU-Driver

- I have tried using the NVIDIA Studio-Driver

- I have tried uninstalling the chipset driver and playing a game without these drivers

- I switched the USB-Ports for my mouse and keyboard

- I disabled one of my monitors and only used one monitor

- I have tried to run sfc /scannow and these DISM-Commands

- I have set the NVIDIA Powerplan to prefer maximum power

- I have set the Global C-States and the DF Cstates to enabled, disabled, and of course auto (default setting)

- Switching PCIE for the GPU from Auto to GEN5 and GEN4

- Switching PCIE for the SSD from Auto to GEN4 and GEN3

- CPPC Preferred Cores from Auto to Driver

- hardware accelerated gpu scheduling on/off

- Deinstalling Armourycrate and other software

- Not installing Armourycrate and other software in the first place after the clean install of Windows

- I have unplugged my headset and every other device besides my monitors, my keyboard and my mouse

- I have done multiple complete scans with Microsoft Defender, multiple normal scans and one offline scan with Microsoft Defender

- I have set the priority of stuttering games to ""High"" using the task manager

- I have checked the temperature of my hardware using HWInfo (Both CPU and GPU have good temperatures and are far from throttling)

- Disabling Windows Gamemode 

- Disabling Steam Overlay

- Stopping the Gamebar-Process

- Checked for Windows Updates

- I made sure that the Turbomode and other Performance ""Enhancements"" are disabled in the BIOS

- I have changed my RAM (I bought 64GB of RAM but got 32GB, so I changed the RAM a few days later. I got stutters in Subnautica, Minecraft, MSFS2024 and Fortnite with the old RAM, I didnt test the other games with the old RAM.)

- I have checked if my new RAM is on the QVL-List (It is on the QVL-List.)

- I downloaded the Kingston-Software and checked if my SSD is fine

- I optimized my SSD using Windows

- I cleaned up my SSD using Windows

- I disabled some unused devices in the device manager

- I have tried to look out for other hardware informations using HWInfo while the framedrops occured to find something that could explain these framedrops

- I have tried to lower the resolution of my monitor and the refresh rate of my monitor 

- I downloaded the software of my mouse and lowered the polling rate

- I have downloaded GPU-Z and checked if I have missing ROPs (I have 112 ROPS)

- I also did the GPU-Z Render-Test and everything seemed to be fine

- I disabled the iGPU

- I checked my SSDs health in the windows file explorer

- As said above: I have tried playing without any software installed besides steam and the game and the drivers, so I have tried it without any monitoring software too.

Note: I have tested most of the stuff I explained above with Cities: Skylines. But Cities: Skylines, as I said, should run fine as it did on my old computer.

  
I have also done some benchmarks and stresstests:

- MemTest86 (both with the old and the new RAM), 0 Errors 

- Multiple 3DMark-Benchmarks (Score was always where you would expect it to be for my hardware), everything was fine here

- Cinebench R23 and R24,, both single- and multicore score was where it should be for my CPU

- A 2 hour + a 40 minute Prime95 Blend-Stresstest, no errors

- A 2 hour Prime95 LargeFFTs-Test, no errors

- 1 Hour OCCT Combined Stresstest (CPU, RAM, GPU and VRAM at the same time), no errors

- CrystalDiskInfo, everything was where you would expect it to be for this SSD

- Rainbow Six Siege Benchmark, FPS, as well as the minimum FPS, were okay (what you would expect for this hardware)

- 45 Minutes OCCT CPU+RAM Stresstest, no errors

- OCCT CPU-Benchmark, results were okay

- OCCT Memory-Benchmark, results were okay

- OCCT Latency/Bandwith-Benchmark, everything looks fine but the L3 Latency is EXTREMLY HIGH. Around 60ns, I have tested it multiple times. It also said that the L3 Cache has a write bandwith of only 248 GiB/s and a read bandwith of about 439.11 GiB/s. I think this is a false reading because I think it would have resulted in significantly decreased performance in benchmarks like Cinebench and 3DMark. But maybe this has something to do with the stuttering?

- Windows memory diagnostic, no errors detected

  
I have also tried to check for problems using LatencyMon and often the DPC-Latency and the interrupt to process latency would be very high with ""nvlddmkm.sys"" causing the high DPC-Latency most of the time.


Another thing that I noticed is that the GPU Wait and the CPU Busy times are very high (I used HWInfo to monitor this) in Cities: Skylines, they can even go as high as 250ms.

  
The desktop and the browser dont really stutter. This seems to work fine. The overall system stability is also great, I didnt had a BSOD yet. Fortnite and MW3 had issues with both of these games crashing because of a DirectX error, but I researched this error and it seems to be driver related.

  
So. I hope someone here can help with these stutters. I am really sad because I hoped my new PC would be a huge upgrade over my old PC (Ryzen 5 3600X with a RTX 2070). Any help is welcome!!!!!

Thank you in advance!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2025-04-08 00:59:42+00:00,1,2
1ju1czn,LocalLLaMA,Quasar Alpha on NoLiMa - 16k Effective Context - Best Known Result,"I ran the NoLiMa (""No Literal Matching"") benchmark on Quasar Alpha with tokenizations as given by `tiktoken.encoding_for_model(""gpt-4o"")`.  This benchmark evaluates performance on long-context information retrieval (needle-in-a-haystack) tasks where there is minimal opportunity for literal text matching between the prompt and needle.  All credit to Modarressi et al. at Adobe Research for the benchmark; their code and results can be found here: https://github.com/adobe-research/NoLiMa

In my testing Quasar Alpha achieves an average score of 85.1% at a context length of 16K, which exceeds the best result (by GPT-4o) given by the authors.  It also outperforms all the models tested by the authors on the abbreviated -Hard benchmark, with an average score of 62.8% at 16K.  
Reasoning models, which in the paper were only evaluated on NoLiMa-Hard, may perform better on the non-hard variant, as may recent models such as Gemini 2.5 Pro.  Nevertheless, given its strong performance on this benchmark I look forward to finding out more about this model.

At 32K I expect Quasar to fall below the 85% threshold, however I've hit the OpenRouter daily rate limit so running that will have to wait for tomorrow.  I will update this post and upload raw result files once that's available.  
One further note: the authors defined ""Base Score"" as the mean of maximums of 250, 500, and 1K context, per task.  Since it's nearly 100% anyways I didn't bother and just used maximum of means, but the Base Score for Quasar Alpha should actually be slightly higher.

1ju1cz4,pokemon,I made a video calmly explaining why Ash Ketchum is the worst trainer in Pokémon history.,"Hey trainers 👋

I run a small channel called *Pokémon Biologist* where I break down Pokémon lore with lo-fi vibes and soft narration. This week, I decided to turn the microscope on Ash himself... and what I found was *brutal*.

From forgetting type matchups to abandoning fully trained Pokémon, Ash might be the most chaotic case of arrested evolution in the franchise. I analyzed him like a real subject—scientific, cozy, and just a little savage.

Hope it gives you a laugh or two while sipping your Oran Berry tea.

1ju1cvh,WH40KTacticus,How They Play,"How they play. I thought I’d make a quick primer on how each faction PLAYS. Meaning overall strategy. This is to help players know if a faction will be fun for them. 

I’m rank 57 with 7.6M total power with 23 heroes rank 5 blue star.

These are just my opinions and I don’t play every faction. Feel free to add your own take.

ULTRAMARINES: are an early faction. They have some of the most difficult heroes to level. Bellator, because of his armor, is good late game. And marneas because of his armor, buff, active, is good late game. But they struggle overall. And are incredibly slow to get diamond level. Built around the lynchpin and buffer marneus who is difficult to acquire. They can survive with a healer and 2 mega defense heroes. But struggle to do dmg.

ASTRA MILITARUM: or another early faction that is difficult to level. They can get two summoners of guardsman, but they tend to retreat easily. Thaddeus is a standout hero. Even at top tier ranks this faction will struggle vs other factions with kut being just one of numerous weak links. Needs an upgrade.

BLACK LEGION: an early chaos faction. They are hard to level, and they simply lack a lot of of fire power. Their kits are outdated and they have largely been power crept by newer chaos factions. No healing, low mitigation except 2 terminators. They have heroes who can provide niche value. Like angrex in onslaught. Hard to level.

DEATH GUARD: recently upgraded, DG are probably the tankiest faction in the game as well as the slowest. They have a great healer and buffer, but both require adjacent units which is impossible. They can hit hard, strip armor, and with buffs, handle most enemies. But their incredible slowness can become a drag and this game overall values offense more than defense. A solid faction, however if you don’t get slowed down by enemy snares and traps.

TAU EMPIRE: a shooty faction built around drones. Their drones can be a nightmare by intercepting enemy attacks, making them more durable than they seem. Revas is perhaps the most used hero in all arena teams. Shosyl is a great sniper. They have two (and a half) heroes who kind of drag. Darkstider is pretty lousy with no drones. Aunshi is a melee buffer who’s buffs rotate from great to meh. Shadowsun drops a largely terrible turret and is anti vehicle, with there being exactly 2 vehicles in the entire game. They are still a solid faction but could use a buff or two.

ADEPTUS SORORITAS: I haven’t played much. Celestine is a powerful melee flier and Isabela is a great static healer. Thick Vindicta is a premier AE fire attacker. But I don’t know how they play well as a whole.

NECRONS: are another faction in need of an upgrade. They are fast, ranged, self-healing mechs. But their health is so low their self healing rarely gets a chance to activate. They have niche units used in other areas. Imospech is great in onslaught with an infinite overwatch. Alephnull is a melee healer who can summon swarms. And anuphet has arguably the most powerful late game summons. But together they still struggle to do dmg and survive dmg.

ORKS: a recent upgrade, the orks are in a good place. The boss charge is what the faction is built around so if you don’t like a single rush as a gimmick, you won’t enjoy them. They have multiple mech units and a healer but can’t recover their fleshy units. Their grots are not only an extremely powerful summon, they’re the most annoying in the game. They can do decent ranged but lean towards melee.  They can struggle on endurance type runs where their one charge is largely mitigated. Very solid.

BLACK TEMPLARS: who? Other than brother bruchard, I largely don’t play this almost exclusive melee faction.

AELDARI: eldar space elf weinies. Their kits are a little bit outdated. Eldryon was probably the most used hero in the game before her nerf. They are flimsy shooters with decent mobility and buffs. But overall their low health and mitigation with no healing make them hard to play.

SPACE WOLVES: or bearded Orks. This faction largely relies on Ragnar and his war cry. So it’s another rush faction with one rush. They have several heroes who really lag the others such as tjark and njal and bdork. Just kidding, there is no hero named tjark. They need a faction buff or they will simply be a supplier of Ragnar to other teams.

THOUSAND SONS: a poofy magic faction they are almost totally psycher. They are also almost totally built around abraxas summons and yazaghor resummons. So they got one summon gimmick and then you’re kind of squishy psychers with no healing. But they are fairly mobile. They don’t hit very hard unless you count smite, which isn’t guaranteed. Don’t perform well in endurance battles but they’re solid in arena-type fights where you have room to summon.

TYRANNIDS: who?

ADEPTUS MECHANICUS: my fave faction. They are shooty mechs with 2 healers. They’ve recently added their 5th hero which is a busted red wagon capable of sucking against most foes. If you can swap in Revas or shosyl or any mech, they are incredibly powerful. But the red wagon is pretty lousy.

BLOOD ANGELS: I got em, but don’t really play them. I’m impressed with Dante’s 45 talents and the ability to buff non adjacent (which I think should be all buffs). They take grimdork and make it even grimmer and dorkier, but are a solid faction. Though I can’t stop laughing at mephiston

DARK ANGELS: blood angels 1.0. These guys are lagging a bit as far as their kits go. And word has it their 5th hero will be released in the year 40,000. Cuz of like symbolism. They have defensive buffs in a game that favors offense. They have their own unique sword, which increases your critical chance. Already they added asmodai who is a hooded potato and largely they are used for baraqiel who can theoretically use his ability infinite times. They are in need of a good buff. Their damage is low and their mitigation is low and don’t really have much of a niche.

WORLD EATERS: the power crept chaos. They hit obscenely hard and are very mobile. They have some mitigation with shield spam but are largely about doing damage. A solid team with good kill potential. But watch out they don’t attack each other.

GENESTEALERS: these guys are so low in health and so spammy in decoys that they’re pretty difficult to play. I’ve tried. They make decoys which can make summons and they can resurrect if the enemy doesn’t step on all you dog poos. But I largely don’t understand them.",2025-04-08 00:59:32+00:00,2,0

1ju1cp3,homelab,Proxmox VM organization,"All,

I have a server build currently going together and need help with organizing VMs. 

I definitely want to use Proxmox because I want to have a Windows VM, truenas VM, and docker containers (VM or through Truenas) all on one unit. I understand that truenas could do all 3 but I have decided on this setup specifically to keep the Windows VM out of another VM. 

The main goal of this AIO unit is to host a Windows VM for a workstation and some emulation gaming if traveling, host a NAS for backing up all my systems, host a media server, and run a few docker services. 

The hardware includes an intel i9 10850k 10 core cpu, Radeon rx 6600 8gb gpu, 32gb ram (expandable to 64gb), 4 WD Red Plus 12tb HDD for storage (Raid 1), and 2 mirrored SSDs that will host Proxmox and VM data (I opted out of an M2 drive to gain the extra HDD for now. I could expand using a PCIE card to add more SATA if this was a big mistake)

My question pertains to efficiency. Where should I place the docker containers? And furthermore, the media stack? 

Options as I see it:

1. Proxmox has 3 VMs- Windows, Docker, Truenas- media stack installed in docker with all other docker containers 

2. Proxmox has 3 VMs but the media docker containers are hosted in truenas- Windows, Docker, Truenas- media stack installed inside the truenas VM with all other docker containers in Docker (not sure if this is a thing but I wasn’t sure if keeping the media items separate would have an impact)

3. Proxmox has only 2 VMs and all docker containers are hosted in truenas - Windows, Truenas- all docker containers would be run side of Truenas scale.

1ju1cjg,ouraring,"Input, please!","Hi all!
26F here who is beginning TTC and has lots of questions :) 

To preface:
• I use ovulation tests, BBT, and Natural Cycles to help in tracking things such as ovulation, my cycle, and other health aspects. 
• I have no diagnosis, but am wondering if I have PCOS. (my OB told me at our Jan. 16th, 2025 meeting that if I was having trouble conceiving after 6 months, we would run testing for PCOS)

My situation/story:
Last week, I had positive ovulation tests on 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, and Natural Cycles confirmed my ovulation on 4/5. 
My hubby and I did the BD on 3/30, 4/2, and 4/4. 

I KNOW it’s early. I promise. 
But, since last Wednesday, my Readiness scores have been steadily declining (as shown in the photo attached), even with a consistent sleep schedule, about the same amount of activity per day, and a “rest mode” day on Sunday, 4/6. It’s gotten as low as 46 for today, 4/7. 
My temperature has steadily increased - I understand that a +0.5 increase after ovulation is “normal,” but mine has gone above +0.5…even reaching +1.0 the past two days. 
I had some spotting on 4/5 and 4/6. My breasts are beginning to become very sensitive. Both common symptoms of ovulation, I hear. 
Yesterday I got a “minor signs” warning, and today I got a “major signs” warning.
I’m not sick, either…

My question: 
What’s going on with my readiness and my temperature? My resting heart rate is considerably up, and HRV balance is considerably down. It couldn’t be pregnancy…could it? 2-3 days after my confirmed ovulation seems far too fast. 

Any ideas?",2025-04-08 00:59:05+00:00,0,0

1ju1chs,motorcycles,Low-Side at 20–25 mph – Could There Really Be Major Damage?,"**Hey everyone,**

Just to get straight to the point – I need your input or opinion on a situation I experienced today.

I went out riding with my buddy, but since my own bike isn’t registered yet, I used his second bike – a 2005 Kawasaki ZX-10R in silver.

Unfortunately, things went a bit sideways (literally). Since the bike has neither ABS nor traction control, I must have hit some debris or dirt on the road while braking. The front tire slipped away unexpectedly, and I ended up low-siding his bike. The whole thing happened at relatively low speed – around 30–40 km/h (roughly 20–25 mph). The bike and I slid across the asphalt, but there was no major impact or collision. The only real hit was when the bike initially dropped onto its side.

Of course, I’m fully taking responsibility for the accident and will cover the damage.

Here’s what happened:

* The bike sustained **minor cosmetic damage**:
   * broken and scratched fairings
   * slightly scratched carbon engine cover
   * one bar end
   * lightly scraped brake lever
* **No contact** between the ground and the **frame, fork, swingarm, or tank**
* After the fall, the bike kept running for a few seconds (maybe 4–5), lying on its side
* A **small amount of coolant** leaked – not enough to form a puddle
* The police were called and documented the incident. We then pushed the bike off the road and had it towed home

My buddy and I were both in a bit of shock, obviously. While looking over the bike, he saw the coolant and said, *“Hopefully that didn’t come from the fork seals.”*  
At that point, I was thinking: **how would the fork suddenly be leaking when it never even touched the ground?**

Then he noticed that the **two front screws that hold down the metal cover above the tank were missing**, and said *“Hopefully they didn’t rip out during the fall.”*  
Again – I was skeptical. The internal threads looked completely fine, no damage at all. And if they had torn out, I’d expect broken-off threads or at least some visible stress. But the threads were totally clean – no signs of tearing or snapping.  
And honestly, it seems pretty far-fetched that **both screws could have completely unscrewed themselves during a short slide at low speed** and vanished without a trace.

We agreed that we’d have a shop look over the bike to assess what was really damaged, and then I’d pay for the repair.  
But I gotta admit: **those two comments (about the fork and tank bolts)** gave the situation a bit of a strange vibe. Not because I think he’s trying to scam me, but because it just didn’t make much mechanical sense.

Back to the **coolant** – it was so little that even the **police on site said it’s nothing to worry about**. The bike didn’t lose any other fluids before or after being picked up.  
Later, when we turned on the ignition (without starting the engine), the **oil warning light stayed on**. The bike had not lost any oil, though.  
According to ChatGPT, this could be normal until the bike is restarted, or it could be something like a damaged sensor or loose wire.

I’ve been riding motorcycles for 3 years now – not an expert, but I know enough to keep my head clear in situations like this.  
So now I’m asking you folks: **how realistic is it that any major damage (like engine, frame, fork, etc.) could result from this kind of low-speed low-side?**

There was **no impact against any object**, no flips, no high-side, no bouncing. The bike slid on its side, and that’s it. Afterward, we were still able to move it around and load it onto the trailer normally – nothing felt off mechanically.

Again: I’m not trying to imply my friend is shady – he was calm and mostly worried that I was okay, which I really appreciated.  
But things like “leaking forks” and “tank bolts ripped out” just seem physically implausible in this case, given the nature of the fall and the parts that actually touched the ground.

 I understand it’s hard to judge something like this without seeing the bike in person or having photos or a video – I’m just hoping for a **rough technical assessment** from experienced riders or mechanics here.  
I’d just like to make sure I’m not overlooking something major, and that I’m not getting blamed for damage that might not realistically have come from this incident.

1ju1c3b,Original_Poetry,The Rose 🌹,"     I am at least 6 good long calendar months from any contact of a Rose who I think of thoughtfully as I wrap my mind around a world where I can't see Honey. 

   Honey is on my mind...I am stuck. I will never forget the last time my eyes saw heaven as I took in all of the color her amber eyes gave me to look at. Next to pupil I looked into the eye of a woman I love. More than love I am forever in love with a Rose.

  My biggest dilemma is a question I can answer in many ways as I ask myself what do I do. What's meant to be will find a way to be and if not then I will be left at a crossroad that I will 
Learn from and let go to love from a distance.

    I have a world of wonder I can lay out to connect the dots into a picture we find a way out of black and white to look for a source of color. I would like to paint this picture. She deserves color.

    I have no idea as to a start of a story that bleeds Red as a Rose will Rise to live again. She has no idea who she is, no idea past a think I thought over a world of thought that ran a riddle down my spine.

   I was 29 years old when I met Kristin Rose 🌹 and instantly my own self could not hold back a connection that nerved it's way into my spine. 

    I am interested in typing my day into night as I look to better understand a woman who stole me mind. She has my existence as my soul is hers. 

Shall I continue? It's a joke that had to riddle itself into a joke just to remind the audience that the riddler has a play of words. Clever he is more than a far from normal as he sits in a left hand that will run in a circle to a spin takes itself into a self spun that feeds it's momentum with no more that the electricity that grounds him out. 

   With that said would you like to fuel the fire. Fire is key in hell to survive we must live within the heat of a source that ignites. I am the Gas in a world that puts me into my natural state. I am fire. I sit in the belly of a man in love with a woman.

This game feels like one of their most polished, dynamic, and addictive creations yet. The movement, the style, the flow — it’s got that perfect Supercell magic, but with an edge.

That said, I’ve got one idea that I think could elevate the experience even more:

Let’s have a central city or social hub where players can just hang out.

No bosses, no rifts, no waves — just vibes.

Imagine a city space where:
	• You can show off your mount, rare titles, or cool skins
	• Global or local chat is buzzing with convos, team-ups, and flexing
	• Maybe even mini player-run stalls, emotes, or arcade corners for role playing
	• Occasional random NPC events or fun interactions — no pressure, just immersion
       • A shop to purchase items

Right now, the gameplay is high-energy and intense — which is great — but giving players a break to connect and chill would help build more of a community around the game, not just a grind loop.

What do you guys think? Would love to hear your takes — and if any Supercell devs are lurking, this could be a dope feature for a future update.",2025-04-08 00:58:25+00:00,3,2

My son (7) has severe food allergies including egg, tree nuts and sesame oil. We are extremely careful with what he eats for obvious reasons, and always carry an Epi-pen.

My family and my wife's sister's family met up at Be Our Guest on our last night so our kids could take it all in one last night before heading home. Kids all at one table and adults right next to them. 

We let the servers know about my son's food allergies, and made it clear that if they can't assure us that they can make things safe for him to eat we brought a backup sandwich and chips. The server said the sheet friendly chicken tenders were safe for him so we ordered since he's been eating those all week at the various quick service spots around. 

He ate them along with the French fries that came with them and all was well. 

The dessert was next so again we asked the server if they can do a modified plate so my son could enjoy painting the teacup with his sister and cousins. They said yes no problem ""We do that all the time.""

All was going great! Dessert came and the server stopped by and said, ""The chef removed the macaron from his plate since that's made with egg whites, and instead of an extra cake pop on the plate since ""those are made without eggs."" That came directly from the chef.

We ordered coffee and started to enjoy our dessert and my kids started painting their teacups and having fun. Suddenly my daughter jumps up frantically and runs to me and says the cake pops have egg in them. Another server comes walking over very quickly as to not make a scene and confirms with me there is indeed egg in the cake they served to my son. Luckily he was so busy painting he hadn't taken a bite yet. 

I was in shock and my daughter started crying knowing what could have happened. My wife and I were so thankful that nothing bad happened that we were too in shock to raise any issue with the manager that soon came over to speak with us. The manager comped my daughter and son's meals without us asking. We paid and left. 

I'm still in shock. We got home last night and I laid in bed and started to cry thinking about what might have happened. God bless that second server who double checked the ingredients. We left her a massive tip in place of the charge for my kids' meals.

Please double and triple check with your servers if you or your loved ones have any severe food allergies. Always carry an Epi-pen like we do and never assume. Thankful my son is ok, but it obviously left a very sour taste in my mouth.",2025-04-08 00:58:17+00:00,1,4

1ju1bw5,PubTips,"[QCrit] SCRAPE, Upmarket Cyberpunk/SciFi (86k words, 2nd attempt)","Dear [agent],

[personalization]

I’m seeking representation for SCRAPE, an upmarket speculative thriller complete at 86K words. It combines Philip K. Dick's reality distortion with William Gibson's gritty cyberpunk aesthetic. I think it will appeal to readers who enjoyed Blake Crouch’s RECURSION and Tom Sweterlitsch's THE GONE WORLD.

A light memory scrape is mandatory for all Arcturis Corp employees. No exceptions. Joe Cooper is Arcturis’ lead memory thief, with a thousand lifetimes threaded into his Brain Boss. When Joe identifies threats to Arcturis, he’s the executioner. But he's unraveling, his identity fracturing, addictions growing, his real past drifting away. He seeks out a risky underground procedure to remove every memory that isn’t his, a desperate attempt to get his life back. But when Arcturis implants a powerful AI in his mind, it threatens everything Joe thought he knew: his reality,  his humanity, even his life. He has to find a way to get rid of it, or learn to live with it, before his time runs out.

Arcturis conscripted Maria Kanner, and she has plenty of secrets in her head. She was once the leader of a group called Five Swords, who sought to expose Arcturis’ darkest secrets. After someone tries to kill her, she’s caught in a strange liminal world, a controlled simulation. The same faces. Same routines. Same lies. When she digs too deep, asks too many questions, they ""reset"" her. But Maria finds a flaw in their system— a way to hide her memories. When she escapes, she learns a devastating truth: she’s not human. She’s a synthetic construct, a Scarecrow created by Arcturis. But if Arcturis made her, why does she carry the memories of Vivienne Wells, the revolutionary who created Five Swords? And who exactly wants her dead?

In a world where memory can be harvested, truth manipulated, and identity erased, the question isn't whether they're human enough. It's whether being human still matters at all.

# The Idea

Do you hate seaports? Do you hate the constant sound of trucks smacking into each other? Do you hate the 5 minute wait for that one CPL to finish with the crane while he pulls 60 crates of public wrenches into a shipping container?

Do you like organization? Do you like trains? Do you like WLL's container yard but thought it was a bit too filled with random boxes of stuff and also kinda only works in on Cannonsmoke?

Do you like going FAST AS FUCK?

We do. So let me introduce MJB's latest ~~larp~~ shakeup of the logi meta [trustmebro](https://www.reddit.com/r/foxholegame/comments/1i3p049/mjb_the_tempest_island_project/): **The Logi Railgun**. What if we did container-based logistics outside of a seaport, but also made it hyper-organized and really, really fast? And what if we could set it up to get a full train of 12 shipping containers anywhere on the front within 10 minutes of a request coming in? This was the idea, and in war 123 we set about making it reality.

# Why do this?

While watching an extremely strong push in war 122 die out due to a severe lack of AT, I had an epiphany. I kept thinking ""If someone could just dump a train full of AT supplies up here in the next 20 minutes, we could take this entire hex no problem"". And then realized that under current logi methods, that wasn't really possible. You could have logistics that was fast, but not in bulk and often not prepared enough to bring the front exactly what it needs. You could have logistics that was in bulk and organized, but not fast. Nobody could, without prep, get a train with multiple containers of exactly needed supplies to the front in under 30 minutes. Often setting up and making train deliveries was an hour+ long process under the best setups.

But we could solve this problem.

# The Design

So what even is this Logi Railgun thing? Here's the basics:

We set up a rail yard just outside of Therizio, along the typical devrail line to the seaport. And using the power of the new crate transfer station pull times, we base the entire rail yard around container logistics but not just any container logistics. Instead we implement *organized* container logistics. This means implementing a system where every container has a set amount of specific crates inside of it so that we can know at a glance exactly which container has what inside of it and ensure that there's no ""nonsense"" crates of just random public stuff like uniforms and radios tossed in there, wasting valuable logi capacity.

[Our railyard layout \(sans defenses and the facility we added onto the north side\)](https://preview.redd.it/elyua63e7ite1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89b5b0d40e05140833d89d23f775b337c188ed1)

We accomplished this by first setting up a line of 6 crate transfer stations along a provisional road, just outside the main NE Therizio road. These crate transfer stations were divided into 6 broad categories of light small arms, heavy small arms, PvE, Anti-tank, tank ammo, and other/utilities. The crate transfer stations serve as an intermediary storage where we can dump crates from factories and the MPF before getting onto the next step, container loading. This system allowed us to almost completely ignore the seaport except for things like BMATs and vehicles.

As mentioned above, our containers were all organized into what we call ""container loadouts"". Using a shared sheet, we set up several pre-set loadouts of 60 crates for the 6 equipment categories above.

[A snapshot of our container tracker sheet, showing the different loadouts](https://preview.redd.it/hytzx3e68ite1.png?width=1364&format=png&auto=webp&s=60dc6171551c6ae45be6081f60fa8bb16f463ecd)

We tried to stick to a few critical loadouts for each category to not overtax our production ability and to ensure we were only producing the most impactful equipment. Each equipment category also had their containers color coded, and we tracked stock and production numbers across the war.

[The individual loadouts for our \\""light small arms\\"" category](https://preview.redd.it/k5k9fiwh8ite1.png?width=954&format=png&auto=webp&s=be06354440943666a6a3d4761dc85c79d99a97ba)

Empty containers were kept in a separate area to the West of the base, and always colored white so we could keep track of which were empty. Once enough crates had been produced and accumulated in the transfer stations/the seaport to build a full container loadout, we'd move the empty containers to the transfer station pads, fill them up, then recolor them and place them in the container yard

[The container yard, split by category and further split by container loadouts](https://preview.redd.it/ahtgd5k29ite1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=6843aaf9e5502f7e73e461b71967702346102337)

The container yard was set up split into 6 sections for the 6 categories, with a dedicated column for each loadout and 2 rows per loadout. Signs were placed denoting the order of the loadouts in each section. For example for small arms, the southernmost column was always rifles, the next always SMG's, the next always grenades, and the final always gas.

This system allowed for anyone from our regiment to be able to tell, at a glance, what we had in stock, to always know where a particular container was, and to be able to quickly coordinate loading trains with our 3 cranes. And because the containers were always sitting there prepped, our regi members knew where everything was, and we had a train sitting in the station at all times, this meant that we could, on a dime, load up a 12 car train and then have it shooting towards the frontline in mere minutes. Hence the name, the Logi Railgun.

**So to run through the whole process**: Regi members move equipment from town factories/MPF to transfer stations. From transfers stations, crates go into organized containers. Organized containers sit in the yard till they're needed, then we hop in the cranes, load up the train as fast as possible, and shoot it out of the station at near-max speed.

# The (lack of) Performance

So some of you may have put this together by now, but unfortunately we did not really have a lot of opportunity to test this concept out this war. Within a day and a half of us completing our train, the only frontline depot we could actually reach was Scuttletown, less than 1500m away because of how far the Wardens had pushed the front up after the fall of Vulpine/Brackish. In total, we made about 4 ""real"" runs with the train before that point, with all the runs after that point just being us dumping supplies wherever we could actually get to because we didn't want them falling into Warden hands.

However! Those 4 runs were pretty good! Two of them were initial test runs, where we were able to load the train up and make it from Therizio to Vulpine in under 10 minutes. From a completely empty, unloaded train with no prep to unloading 12 storage containers into Vulpine storage in like 9 and a half minutes was crazy.

We also, I am proud to admit, fulfilled an order directly from **SEED HIMSELF**, who called for logi aid to Saltbrook and we answered. We managed to, again with 0 prep (we were all busy scrooping at the time he started posting in logi chat) load up the logi railgun and fire off a 12 container shot of logi into Endless Shore seaport in under 7 minutes. And because of our organized system, we were able to bring tons of the exact equipment Seed had requested (Lunaires, Gas, Shirts, AT, of which we brought 2 containers of each). And within an hour or two of our delivery, the attack was repelled!

I think we more than made up for our earlier sins that war...

# Conclusion, Pros and Cons

So it's hard to make a definitive conclusion about this system because of how cut short it was, but overall we feel pretty good about it! It definitely has some real flaws, but we think being able to offer a fast, accurate, on-demand bulk logi service like this could potentially be super useful. We're probably not going to try this again next war because we're a smallish regiment who REALLY stretched ourselves to make this happen (first time doing bulk MPF logi and it's HARD) and after trying so hard for such a short war we probably are gonna do something slightly more chill in 124. However we'd be excited to see others try the concept and see how it potentially evolves!

**Pros:**

* Fast as FUCK
* Accurate (always able to deliver exactly what people request)
* Avoids logi town seaport headaches
* Doesn't block half the logi town with your big ass train while you load
* Can make a huge impact if the right supplies are delivered at the right time

**Cons**

* VERY prone to alting. [We actually caught an alt trying to dump crates from our transfer stations onto the floor](https://www.reddit.com/r/foxholegame/comments/1jo517y/please_bring_back_locked_reserveable_transfer/). We thought that was going to be the end of our little experiment right there, but thankfully they never came back
* Pretty at risk of partisans with all those containers and crates in the open outside of the safety of the seaport. However the proximity to a logi hub and also the amount of space you'll have to build defenses (since it's a rail hub and needs a lot of space to begin with) gives you some good protection. We built some solidly half-assed defenses this war and didn't have an incident with partisans at all, despite heavy partisan activity.
* Makes all of your supplies very public, since technically anyone can just waltz in and decide to just deliver your containers for you
* Need to balance deliveries with stock. You don't want to have too much stuff just sitting in your container yard, but you also don't want to be in a situation where you can't bring something urgently needed because you're out.

1ju1bjl,prius,"2025 Prius LE Reserved, question on stargard","I reserved a 2025 white Prius LE from Toyota of Marin.  I've been looking around for a while and my lease is running out on my old car and I can't tell what's gonna happen with tarriffs so was trying to lock in the current MSRP, though toyota said they'd eat the increase.

  
I looked at the price sheet and it says ""STARGARD ($1,295.00)"".  This largely looks like a scam and I'd like to get it removed though the dealership has basically admitted there's limited inventory so they are basically using it as a markup opportunity over standard MSRP which seems to be what stargard was for, which I appreciate the honesty and I agree they do have me over the barrel on price a bit, so I'm fine eating part of the costs, but I don't want the stupid thing in the car causing problems / allowing me to be tracked by the dealer for a car I'm paying cash for.

  
Any words of advice?  Go in and try to get them to take it out?  Don't pay for it?  Walk away?  Anyone have any experience with Toyota of Marin?",2025-04-08 00:57:39+00:00,2,1
1ju1bht,orthodontics,"What should I do? Extracted later incisors, not enough root space for implants yet - pictures attached","I had my lateral incisors extracted by an orthodontist when I was 8 years old. The situation has caused me to lose a lot of confidence as I’ve worn trays and retainers without real teeth for the majority of my life.

I am now on my 2nd attempt to try and get an implant but I’ve run into an issue of not having enough root space between my front and canine teeth. I’ve been working with a periodontist and an orthodontist. The ortho gave me 8 trays to make the space. They were able to move roots to make adequate space on my left site, but the space between my roots on my right site didn’t budge. 

My ortho said this was because the roots on my front teeth are bowed. He says he knows how to fix it, will revise the dental plans, and give me another 4 trays. After the failure of the first 8 trays to get me where I need to be, I have lost confidence and become anxious about the situation. I’m wondering if he’s selling me a pipe dream about being able to open up 1mm of root space on my right lateral incisor. 

I have attached the pictures of my bowed roots. I have the bone density for the implant, the root space is the real issue. My questions are:

1. Does 1mm of root movement with bowed roots seem possible? 

2. Can Invisalign “tip” a root? 

Thank you, happy to clarify any questions. I’m quite bummed out. It’s been 8 years of trying and failing to find a solution. 

If you want photos, I’ve asked similar questions to r/invisalign and r/dentistry with no success

However, most dog parks I come across are gravel with absolutely no paths even to just the entry gate, meaning I can't get there in a wheelchair. I would like to get my dog more exercise (the part of Denver I live in only has those narrow half-sized sidewalks that also don't fit wheelchairs very well so taking her on a long walk around the neighborhood is typically a nightmare unless I want to roll in the streets...) and was hoping that a dog park might be an option but so far in searching that seems not to be the case...any ideas?

1ju1ayu,LittleRock,"LITTLE ROCK PHOTOS (March  31 - April 6, 2025)","
Green.

That’s the very obvious thread running through this week’s photos.

And for good reason, too. The color is everywhere.

Its on the fresh buds of new life on the trees.

Its in the clouds during storms.

Its in the windows of skyscrapers, as they are simultaneously lit from within & without.

Its on those little scooters downtown.

Even the current flag of Little Rock, redesigned in 1988, uses the color green to signify the “fields, parks and forests which contribute to the natural beauty of the city.”

ngl green is  the color i most closely associate with Little Rock. 

During my first visit, as a young butter bar 2nd lieutenant driving across country from Washington DC to artillery school at Ft. Sill in the early 90’s, I recall parking my truck on a street near the old statehouse. 

I was  struck by the great canopies of green trees downtown. It reminded me of walking the streets of Washington DC in the 1970s and 1980s with my granddad.

Then again in the early 2000s, when i started spending holidays here with my  ex in-laws…. I remember being in awe of the green light of summer mornings in all these tree covered neighborhoods, from Hillcrest to the original Simms BBQ (the one that burnt down … I think it was all the way down the south end of Broadway).

Green to me, evokes feelings of cleanliness. 

Things that are crisp and cool and fresh.

Thats definitely the energy I feel around downtown LR right now. Or maybe its just my own energy.

I’ll take either.

A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THIS PROJECT 
✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
This is part of a year-long project for me - looking at Little Rock photographically in ways that it never has been. 

I explain the project best in the post titled “LITTLE ROCK PHOTOS (February 17-24, 2025).”

I keep playing with the title, but really what we have here is Little Rock through the trans gaze.

I post pictures from Little Rock on BlueSky page several times a week (Link in my profile)

Weekly, I’ll curate a handful of photos alongside  a journal entry about my experience in our town.

The last photo in the carousel is a photo of me… There are several reasons

First, it’s important to me that viewers know that i am a trans femme photographer and I’m looking at Little Rock through the lens of a Queer person.

Second, safety… people are naturally suspicious of photographers, no less one dressed as fine as me. Lolz. The more people there are who recognize me, the safer i am.

Third, I want you to see that i am very approachable. If u recognize me,  you can come up and say hi if you see me out “in the wild”. I want to hear about your life and your experience in Little Rock and what you think I should consider photographing here.

Sorry for the hashtag… I’m doing it solely for my ability to gather these posts and review the flow of the project from time to time
