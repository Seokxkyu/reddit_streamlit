1ju52j9,pinoy,Duterte's Boracay cleanup program was really underappreciated,"Back in 2018, Duterte shut down Boracay for six months and forced businesses to comply with environmental laws and upgrade their sewage systems. Even local water providers were ordered to improve their infrastructure and the results were very impressive.

Fast forward today, an international celebrity is in critical condition after contracting a bacterial infection from dirty water in El Nido, another Philippine paradise lacking proper sanitation because of weak leadership.

Yet when people talk about Duterte, it’s always all about EJK. Almost no one brings up the big wins like the successful Boracay rehab.

1ju2qz7,AmItheAsshole,"WIBTA for not paying ""more"" for my tour?","So I went on a tour to Yemen two weeks ago. I was packed and ready to go and had a group chat with everyone and the tour guide. A week before the person organising the tour asked if the price for 1200 is still confirmed. I read it as 1200 together and brought 300 dollars.  
This wasn't the case and no one informed me the total price, actually of anything except a single message with a PDF of my visa.  
So I find out when I meet the other 3 at the airport and literally boarding to Yemen they ask if I brought $1200, I didn't. No ATM and the tour guide refuses to discuss it and being very flippant, if was kind of anxious as I am in a foreign country completely different to mine.  
On the way to the airport is when he brings up the 900$ and mentions a guy in Dubai to send the remaining balance and I agree.  
It's an international transfer, I send it and get harassed daily by this Dubai guy and the guide when I sent screenshots of my transfer, he was even telling others from the tour to message saying I'm not paying.  
It finally arrives and the AED was around $25 less, I sent my screenshot from my bank which was 710 pounds (907 dollars).  
I feel I did my end of the bargain but he's messaging like I short changed him when I actually paid more but for whatever reason, currency etc. it was less.  
Should I pay?  
Edit: I forgot to add, we gave him a $100 tip each, I sent my part of the tip to a friend with a local bank.  

Ok maybe I need to add context to this; The message was buy another tourist ""so is the 1200 price still ok?"" Which he didn't reply, it's why I assumed 300 each, either way there was no communication . The guide never messaged me to say to me how much of anything, not even an itinerary, except the pdf of my visa I needed to print (that tourist directly messaged me saying I needed to print it, he just sent it to me).

1jtzhzp,antkeeping,Pogonomyrmex occidentalis heating,I have a colony with about 20 workers and they move the pupae to and from the test tube to the nest each day. I was wondering if I should adjust the heating pad so that it hits the top half of the test tube (away from the water) to help with the colonies growth? I ask because last time I checked the test tube I did not see any eggs but figured I would give them some time after attaching the outworld/nest and let them settle in. I figure I will give them some more time before I check again and understand that young colonies do best when left alone. They also had a small pile of seed husks/trash pile in the test tube which I figured they would move into the out world when it was attached but have yet to do so. They continue to take seeds and the occasional Dubai roach part when offered . This is my first harvester ant colony and would just like to see them thrive. Any other tips and or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you,2025-04-07 23:27:45+00:00,1,0

- I dust only the Superworms with Calcium (with phosphorous and Vitamin D3)

I've been actively looking for a job for the past 3 months and could really use some help or advice. I lost my previous role due to company restructuring, as HQ decided to move my department's operations elsewhere. This has put me in a difficult spot financially.

I live in Abu Dhabi and, as a single parent, I have no external financial support.

I have 13 years of experience in the marketing industry, including leadership roles across the Middle East, Africa, and the APAC region.

My background includes extensive experience in events, retail branding, social media, account management, and relationship management. Most recently, I was the Regional Marketing Head for a well-known company in Dubai, and I'm looking for new opportunities in marketing or related fields. I am open to various roles and would appreciate any leads, recommendations, or advice.

1jty6mu,dubai,How to file a noise complaint with the police on a hotel,"I live near a hotel that has a nightclub in it. On weekends, it’s expected that the streets get noisy—mostly from drunk people hanging around, being loud while waiting for rides. But lately, I’ve noticed the same level of noise creeping into the weekdays.

Right now, it’s 2 a.m. on a Tuesday morning, and I was just woken up by people shouting outside, right in front of the hotel. I looked out the window and saw a large crowd gathered in the street. I couldn’t tell if there had been a fight or if they were just being drunk and obnoxious. On top of that, many of them drive loud supercars, which makes it even worse.

At this point, the noise is becoming unbearable. Is there anything I can do about it?

1jty3dr,canadatravel,Fly via US or Change,"Hey guys, I know no one has a crystal ball so it's hard to predict something a few months away, but looking at my options. I have a roundtrip flight booked from Dallas to Dubai via Emirates coming up in July. We were supposed to travel with some family from there, but due to the way US customs has been, they don't want to risk getting refused re-entry back and have cancelled their flights.

So my options are either to keep that itinerary, risk myself to travel to the USA, I've heard reports of even Canadian citizens being refused entry there. Change my origin flight to like Toronto/Montreal as Emirates do fly from there as well. I'm likely going to wait till mid-end of May, maybe into June to see if things improve or not and then decide.

Obviously the better option is to take a direct flight to the USA from a Canadian airport, this way if you are refused entry, go back home, no issues; in my case I live in Edmonton so I'd look for a 1 stop flight to Dallas via another USA city (there are no direct flights from YEG so like YEG > IAH > DFW), customs would be in Edmonton as that would be the first entry into the USA or fly from Calgary (American Airlines flies direct from YYC to DFW).",2025-04-07 22:22:55+00:00,0,2

1jtw06h,RasAlKhaimah,How to find an Apartment in RAK City at a good price 2BHK,"I am new in RAK. I wanted to live in Al Hamra but after living here for 1 month I can see that this area is not for me as my budget is less while everything is over prices. 
In Al Hamra everything seems to be controlled by real estate agents. 
They are asking 5% of commission.  
5% security. 
1500 FEWA. 
2-3K Municipality. 

I have lives in Ajman and Dubai where it was very easy. You can go to developers office like Aqar and they give you an apartment without this high commission, security and maintainance was also with Developers for tenants. 

Now here in RAK they say everything less than 500 AED will be on tenant and above 500 will be on owner. 

Now I have decided to just move to RAK city, Nakheel, Al Dhait or Riffa area. The problem will be commuting daily to Mina Al Arab for work and office. 

Can someone please suggest what to do where to go to find a nice 1-2BHK in the budget of 20-25K AED. The max I can pay is 30K AED. 1200-1500 square feet will be ideal even of its 1-BHK. 

I want to avoid these hefty commissions, maintainance charges and burden. 

Please guide me what to do and where to look for apartments. ",2025-04-07 20:52:13+00:00,2,0
1jtvxhu,Perfumes,Beginner Questions,"As someone who has always worn Lynx body sprays as an attempt to smell good, during a trip to Dubai, I decided to take the plunge and get some bottles! They're delightful and I do wonder why I never indulged myself. 
I've always considered perfumes as being something only reserved for wealthier people or special occasions. I now realize how silly a notion it was. 

Now that I have a bottle or two in my collection (My my, they are lovely things, aren't they!), I have a few questions as a beginner!

      1) I can appreciate mileage varies here, but how long does a 100ml bottle last you typically?
	2) Are atomizers worth it? If so, are there any particular things I should be mindful of?
	3) Perfumes can cost a pretty penny, so are there things I should be way of? What's generally considered a waste of money? 
	4) What are peoples experience with Roll Ons? Are they worth it? I imagine they're more ""economical"" compared to sprays, how much so?

I'm doing well for myself now so I can afford to buy a bottle every once in a while which I plan on doing, but I'm being economical as well. It's nice to see the various collections and I find the designs of some of these bottles to be amazing!

In recent 5 years, after father retired, they have been doing well, going abroad (never been abroad with them), sometimes even twice a year, at some point even more often than myself cause I was saving for mortgage since covid started. So cant say they are poor or anything like that.

So We got this house in 2022, we invited them in, they never spoke of actually coming to see us, but they went to Greece if I recall correctly at that time.

At 2024 We moved to other house, and invited them again, but this time they also never asked about visiting us but they were so proud of trip they took to Dubai. I had listen actually twice about that trip, once over phone second time in person.

They have 50th anniversary of wedding this year, I told them Im coming actually for the anniversary and I dont plan to stay whole week in country, and my mother start complain that every time I visit them its just for a week, and I should be visiting family more often, and so on, totally not understanding that I dont have limitless time off like them and I dont even go twice to holidays like them.

I asked mother like a week ago why is that always a problem, and why they never visited me but had no problem go to Dubai last year, and her response was ""I might die soon and you wont have that problem with us"".

I dont really knew what to say back then, she would always complain that I wont come while doing really nothing on her side to see me.

In recent 5 years, after father retired, they have been doing well, going abroad (never been abroad with them), sometimes even twice a year, at some point even more often than myself cause I was saving for mortgage since covid started. So cant say they are poor or anything like that.

So We got this house in 2022, we invited them in, they never spoke of actually coming to see us, but they went to Greece if I recall correctly at that time.

At 2024 We moved to other house, and invited them again, but this time they also never asked about visiting us but they were so proud of trip they took to Dubai. I had listen actually twice about that trip, once over phone second time in person.

They have 50th anniversary of wedding this year, I told them Im coming actually for the anniversary and I dont plan to stay whole week in country, and my mother start complain that every time I visit them its just for a week, and I should be visiting family more often, and so on, totally not understanding that I dont have limitless time off like them and I dont even go twice to holidays like them.

I asked mother like a week ago why is that always a problem, and why they never visited me but had no problem go to Dubai last year, and her response was ""I might die soon and you wont have that problem with us"".

I dont really knew what to say back then, she would always complain that I wont come while doing really nothing on her side to see me. Once she was even asking how many days of time off I have and she started calculating how I should dispose them during year (of course to go back to them, not like holidays or anything).

I really dont know what to do, that situation is like constant for 8 years, but that last year with them going to Dubai really hit me.

I dont want to make them sad by not showing up at their big party, but honestly if I hear another complain about that I might not go at all. I would really like to travel somewhere else instead going there, watch them fight like I watched for 20 years and being gratefull to 22yo me that I moved out.

Should I dont even go there this year? Or should that be last time Im going there?",2025-04-07 20:28:27+00:00,1,2

1jtv0o4,chicagofood,I’m a pistachio freak. Please drown me in them.,"Planing a day trip into the city and I need my fix. Where can I have a pistachio filled day start to finish? I’m talking a pastry bursting with pistachio cream, a pistachio latte, a pistachio ravioli or pizza, some pistachio crusted fish, some Dubai chocolate or baklava, and then a decadent pistachio cake for dessert. I searched and found a couple old threads but a lot of the places closed or offered seasonal pistachio items 2 years ago. 

I also do NOT like artificial or almond-y pistachio, so nothing that is marzipan-like or dyed green, please. Just delicious pistachio delicacies :P

EDIT to say DAMN YALL SHOWED UP 🫶🏼😭 thank you so much, my list is now at least a three day weekend’s worth of pistachio dreams 💚",2025-04-07 20:11:52+00:00,182,136

I'm leaving Dubai soon to study in Canada and I'm planning to take my PC with me. I'm a bit unsure about the best way to ship it internationally. Should I ship the fully assembled rig, or would it be safer to disassemble it and only take the key components, leaving behind the case and monitor?

I've heard a suggestion that shipping just the parts might reduce the risk of damage and potentially cut down on shipping costs, but I'm not completely sold on that idea. Has anyone here shipped their PC or similar electronics internationally?

In all these places, public transport is efficient, infrastructure looks top-notch, crime is low, and people seem generally happier and less stressed.

Meanwhile, in the US, we’ve got broken roads, homelessness on every corner, rising crime, crumbling infrastructure, and constant economic pressure on the average person. For a country that’s supposed to be “the most powerful,” it really doesn’t feel like it on the ground.

Why do you think that is? What are these countries doing differently? I’d love to hear thoughts from people who’ve traveled or lived abroad.",2025-04-07 19:33:29+00:00,0,34

1jtty05,EngineeringStudents,(18M) Robotics Student at Heriot-Watt Dubai looking for advice on future studies.,"Hey everyone!

I'm an 18-year-old currently in my first year of a Robotics Engineering undergraduate program at Heriot-Watt University (Dubai campus). While I'm enjoying my studies here, I'm already starting to think about potential options for my Master's degree or even transferring for my Bachelor's in a year or two.

I'm particularly interested in universities in the UK, the US, or any other country renowned for its strong Robotics programs. I'd love to hear your recommendations and insights!

**Specifically, I'm curious about:**

* **Top-tier universities for Robotics Engineering in the UK and the US (and beyond!).** What programs are particularly strong in areas like AI in robotics, autonomous systems, robot design, or control systems?
* **Experiences of international students** at these universities. What are some things I should be aware of regarding the application process, visas, cultural adjustments, and overall student life?
* **Any advice for someone in my position.** Are there specific skills I should focus on developing now? What kind of projects or extracurriculars would strengthen my future applications? Should I be looking at internships already?
* **Insights into the academic rigor and teaching styles** at universities in these regions compared to my experience so far.
* **Any general tips for planning future academic pathways** as an international student in engineering.

Also, I'm pretty keen about these universities' sports programs, as I would love to play football (soccer) as much as I can!

I'm really open to exploring different options and would greatly appreciate any advice, personal experiences, or recommendations you might have. Thanks in advance for your help!",2025-04-07 19:28:35+00:00,1,0

It was all green and with a yellow symbol, similar to a star but with much more points. Everything was in ruins, and there was black smoke everywhere and small fires between the rocks and debris. I also heard helicopters? Or planes I don't know, flying overhead, all the time.

I didn't even ""see"" myself in the dream. Here it gets confusing and I can't even say for sure if it's the same dream. But I also saw a burned hand, holding ashes in its hands, and a woman's voice screaming ""that was Dubai and now it's gone"".

Wtf?

I want to add that I am neither from Dubai nor I have any connection to it whatsoever, and it's the reason I can't pinpoint why would I dream this? ",2025-04-07 18:35:14+00:00,1,6

1jtsjcu,dubai,"The property is nearing handover, but I haven’t had the chance to complete the snagging yet. Nor did the seller. I just visibly saw the building. Is this a standard DLD document that I’m required to sign at this stage, or should I request again and push for it to be removed",,2025-04-07 18:31:38+00:00,2,9
1jtsgei,UAEjobseekers,Indian lawyer in talks for a position in Dubai. NEED INSIGHT/ADVICE,"Hi, I am a 28 year old from India who is currently in talks for a position in Jebel Ali Dubai. I am a lawyer and work at a tier 1 firm in the commercial capital of the country. While this may sound too enticing to give up, the long hours and grind has gotten to a point where I am looking for something more sustainable. I have completed my masters and have been considering working/studying abroad for a little bit, get that exposure and experience and decide where I want to set up my nest eventually. Middle east has rose up to become one of my first options in this regard unlike US/UK which do not seem worth the hype and the ROI is just not worth it. I dont want to end up in student debt for the rest of my life. I have got my degree and have considerable work experience under the belt now (5 years this October) and now seems to be the right time to explore more and starting with a job seems to be the best option in my case. The position is one of an executive secretary to the managing director with a side of legal work as well. I dont mind the admin part of the job because i quite frankly enjoy it and hope to learn more about the work and the place through it. I just want to get some insight on the work and life in jebel ali as well as what is a good salary to live in Dubai in today’s times. ",2025-04-07 18:28:23+00:00,2,0

1jtsfmt,UAE,Indian lawyer in talks for a position in Dubai. NEED INSIGHT/ADVICE,"Hi, I am a 28 year old from India who is currently in talks for a position in Jebel Ali Dubai. I am a lawyer and work at a tier 1 firm in the commercial capital of the country. While this may sound too enticing to give up, the long hours and grind has gotten to a point where I am looking for something more sustainable. I have completed my masters and have been considering working/studying abroad for a little bit, get that exposure and experience and decide where I want to set up my nest eventually. Middle east has rose up to become one of my first options in this regard unlike US/UK which do not seem worth the hype and the ROI is just not worth it. I dont want to end up in student debt for the rest of my life. I have got my degree and have considerable work experience under the belt now (5 years this October) and now seems to be the right time to explore more and starting with a job seems to be the best option in my case. The position is one of an executive secretary to the managing director with a side of legal work as well. I dont mind the admin part of the job because i quite frankly enjoy it and hope to learn more about the work and the place through it. I just want to get some insight on the work and life in jebel ali as well as what is a good salary to live in Dubai in today’s times. ",2025-04-07 18:27:30+00:00,0,0
1jtsdns,AllFoodEntrepreneurs,Dubai Chocolate: Chasing Trends for Quick Money,"We all know that food and beverage trends are hard to keep up with. 

      By the time a trend is popular and you attempt to make it to sell, it seems that trend will start to become old and be replaced by another trend.

    The constant cycle of a trend emerging and then dying is becoming faster than ever before. Social media is the main culprit for trends to come and go at a moment’s notice, which is not good for you or your business. 

    Should you keep up with the food or beverage trends of the day? It depends.  

If you have the ability to quickly find the trend, make it, and advertise to sell it on social media. 

Do not feel bad if you cannot do this, following a food or beverage trends is a fast-paced game that not everyone can do. Also, the money you earn may not be worth the time and investment in following a trend. 

Just some food for thought.

I hope you're all doing well.

I'm planning to come to the UAE next August, InshaAllah, to look for a job opportunity in Dubai.
 I hold a Master’s degree in Business Law, with 1 year of experience in the legal field and 2 years of experience as a sales agent.

I also speak four languages fluently, including English and Arabic.

Caught a crowded train to get to practice. Aunties pushing from one side, uncles using newspapers as shields. Switched trains mid-way. At this point, I’ve changed more trains than career goals.

Cricket practice. Flat pitch, again. Coach gave me the “you disappoint me” stare even before I picked up the ball. “Bowl like Bumrah, not like Bablu from gali cricket!”—sir, let me warm up first at least.

Batted alright. Didn’t get sledged today, which is rare. Fielded like I was auditioning for a toothpaste ad—smiling, running, and confused.

Lunch: 5 cucumbers. No, I’m not on a diet. I just don’t want to argue about food anymore. At this point, I’m basically one salad away from turning into a plant.

Evening was piano time. Played one bhajan, one Bollywood song, and accidentally hit a note that sounded like a dying duck. Felt musical though.

1jtrv0d,skyscrapers,World's Best Skyline Tournament - Bangkok vs Wuhan (Round 1 Match 5),"Vote here: [https://strawpoll.com/wby5QDbpJyA](https://strawpoll.com/wby5QDbpJyA)

It wasn't even close. **Hong Kong** takes the win with 378 votes to 58, which is close to a 7-to-1 margin. Dubai was able to have a fourth of the vote share early on, but it slowly dropped throughout the day. HK moves on to round 2.

Today, two Asian giants with immense and rapidly ascendant skylines collide with each other. Bangkok and Wuhan have skylines that are comparable in size, while Wuhan edges it out slightly in height, having 7 supertalls to Bangkok's 3. Their skylines are so wide that neither could be fully captured in one shot. In addition, both cities have high-rises along a river that runs through them: Bangkok with the Chao Praya River, and Wuhan with the Yangtze River.

**Bangkok** is the capital and largest city of Thailand, a megacity of 18 million on the Gulf of Thailand. Its skyscraper boom began in the 1980s during the Asian investment boom, and has been ceaseless since - with the exception of the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997. This accelerated into the 2010s as the city gained a metro system, with many new skyscrapers developed around MRT and skytrain systems. The Baiyoke Tower II supertall forms peak around Lumphini park, a large urban park similar to Central Park in New York. However, perhaps the most recognizable skyscraper is King Power MahaNakhon, known for its distinct, geometric Jenga-like form. A third supertall was built near the Iconsiam mall, and remains the tallest building in the city. The One Bangkok development, which is underway, will see the construction of a new 400-meter tall supertall. Today, new condo towers sprout up constantly.

**Wuhan** is the capital of the Chinese province of Hubei, and perhaps central China's most important city. Population estimates put the urban population between 8 to 12 million. While Wuhan is infamous globally for being where the Covid-19 pandemic originated, it had been a major hub in central China for quite some time, and is sometimes compared to Chicago for its role as a transport hub. It built its first skyscrapers in the late 1990s, and a supertall in 2008, but it was from the late 2010s that its skyline really took off. Its tallest skyscraper is the Wuhan Greenland Center, which was originally planned to reach a staggering height of 636 meters, before Chinese regulators demanded that it was cut. Its skyscraper boom continues, and over 20 new ones have been added yearly in the past 4 years. A whopping 5 supertalls are still in construction.

[Vote by clicking the link here](https://strawpoll.com/wby5QDbpJyA) for which city you think has a better skyline. You can also discuss or duke it out in the comments. Remember, the vote should be about the **skyline**, not about the city itself, nor national or international politics.",2025-04-07 18:04:29+00:00,117,24

* Business roundtable in Mumbai to deepen economic cooperation

Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Al Maktoum’s first official visit to India as[ Crown Prince](https://worldmagzine.com/world/allegations-against-saudi-crown-prince-forgery-and-yemen-war-controversy/) of Dubai marks a significant moment in the evolving India-UAE relationship.

The Crown Prince’s stop in Mumbai highlights the growing role of [business ](https://worldmagzine.com/business/smart-online-marketing-investments-for-small-business-growth/)in foreign relations. His participation in a business roundtable with Indian and Emirati industry leaders aims to open doors to collaboration in multiple sectors. These sectors range from infrastructure and energy to fintech and innovation.

# Strengthening Bridges: Dubai Crown Prince’s India Visit Aims at Future-Focused Cooperation

The Crown Prince’s visit reflects the growing strategic importance of the India-UAE partnership. Both countries aim to play larger roles on the[ global economic stage](https://worldmagzine.com/politics/carneys-diplomatic-push-strengthening-canadas-global-alliances/). The UAE is one of India’s top trade partners, and Dubai plays a central role in facilitating trade routes. Additionally, it aids investment flows between the two nations.

Beyond trade, the visit underscores the defense and diplomatic engagement that has expanded between New Delhi and Abu Dhabi. As Minister of Defence, Sheikh Hamdan’s discussions with Indian leaders may include regional security dynamics. They may also discuss joint cooperation in defense manufacturing and technology.

The India-UAE Comprehensive Strategic Partnership has gained momentum over the years with several high-level visits. There have also been agreements on energy cooperation and increasing people-to-people ties. Dubai, as the home of the majority of the[ Indian diaspora](https://worldmagzine.com/world/indian-diaspora-in-dubai-extends-a-warm-welcome-to-pm-modi/) in the UAE, is a vital hub of cultural and familial connectivity.

Mumbai’s business roundtable will bring together innovators, investors, and industrialists. It will create a unique platform to explore joint ventures. With a shared interest in sustainability, digital transformation, and economic resilience, the visit may result in new avenues of cross-border synergy.

Sheikh Hamdan’s visit marks not just diplomatic tradition but a forward-looking vision. It aims to elevate [India-UAE](https://worldmagzine.com/business/india-uae-cepa-balancing-revenue-losses-and-economic-opportunities/) relations into a model of modern global partnership grounded in shared goals and mutual respect.

\
\
Una sorta di media center e game launcher che funge anche da frontend per l'esecuzione di ROM attraverso emulatori come Mednafen, Dolphin e PCSX2.\
https://twitter.com/SvenGDK/status/1908898193783267719\
In questa versione, sono state apportate modifiche interne per migliorare la stabilità del lettore ISO e ottimizzare il sistema di ricerca per icone e sfondi, limitando la scansione a una sola lista di alias dei giochi.\
Il comportamento di caricamento della schermata ""Home"" è stato rivisto per correggere la disposizione errata di app e giochi durante il caricamento, il ricaricamento o l’aggiunta di nuovi contenuti.\
Inoltre, ora l’input è disabilitato fino al completamento del caricamento della ""Home"", e il rilevamento dei giochi installati sul disco C: è stato migliorato.\
Al momento, la rilevazione automatica dei giochi funziona solo nelle cartelle C:\Program Files (x86) e C:\Games, ma è previsto un futuro aggiornamento che estenderà questa funzione anche ad altri dischi.\
L’elenco di esclusione, che impedisce la visualizzazione di determinati elementi come launcher o error reporter, è stato aggiornato e ora include anche GOG Galaxy e REDlauncher, se presenti sul sistema.\
Sono stati aggiunti 19 nuovi set di icone e 17 nuovi sfondi, oltre al supporto preliminare per i modelli Asus ROG Ally X e MSI Claw in vista di usi futuri.\
Tra le correzioni, sono stati risolti alcuni crash occasionali nell’esplora file e un’anomalia grafica relativa all’animazione dello sfondo durante la selezione di app o giochi privi di asset grafico associato.\
Infine, l’app ""Media"" è stata rimossa dagli strumenti interni, in quanto considerata superflua rispetto all’esplora file già integrato.\
OrbisPro è attualmente in fase BETA, il che significa che potrebbero verificarsi alcuni bug durante l'utilizzo dell'applicazione. Si consiglia agli utenti di consultare il Wiki su come utilizzare OrbisPro disponibile all'indirizzo https://github.com/SvenGDK/OrbisPro/wiki/First-Run per istruzioni dettagliate.\

1jtqtxi,dubai,Have immigration rules changed? I just found I overstayed when I'm usually granted 90 days.,"Hi everyone! I finished a work contract last year, so a few days before my visa expired I did an Airport 2 Airport trip to Bahrain (not the first time doing this) and came back. 

Usually the process is seamless. Now the 90 day period is about to finish and I happen to check on Smart Services to get the exact date to leave the country. To my surprise I am overstaying 85 days without having the slightest idea. Not sure what I've done differently that my last exit did not renew my stay. OR did the rules change?

Also, how can I go for a waiver? What's the best way to solve this? I'm also starting a new job contract this week. I'm wondering if I can get some kind of help from my employer. I'm not sure. Please shed some light. Thanks so much!

First, am I able to change my travel dates and still have the visa remain valid? I’m considering flying a week earlier than originally planned.

Second, do my flights both into and out of the country need to be booked through Emirates, or is it only the arrival flight that must be with Emirates?

My baby is 8 months old and for 6 months of her precious life, her skin has been experiencing these lighter itchier flaky skin. Initially we thought eczema but it started to show up on her legs and crease areas. We used a few eczema topical creams to keep the skin moisturized but it kept spreading. A paed mentioned ring worm and we started using lamisil and similar creams. Took her for an allergy test and she’s not allergic to anything. We are from South Africa but living in Dubai, and another paed mentioned the climate is affecting her skin. However we’ve cycled through different seasons and the marks comes and goes. 
We are stumped and not sure what else to try. It’s affecting her sleep patterns and she scratches herself to the point that it bleeds. It’s really awful not knowing. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

1jtplic,WhatShouldIDo,"A friend’s of a friend knocked my phone put my hand, now i need to replace the whole phone but i don’t have the money for it but she does. What should i do?","

My phone was in my hand and she accidentally knocked it out of it which it landed on the floor and cracked my front camera. She picked it up and gave back to me, shocking news it was cracked and she was laughing awkwardly which is absolutely fair because i would do the same but she didn’t even say sorry which made it even more weirder and i had said like “you cracked my screen?” or something and this girl looked at me so offended and told me that it wasn’t even her fault and i was like bro you just knocked it out my hand so she said that it was both of our faults. I looked her like really confused because like what the hell? first you didn’t even say sorry and now its my fault as well, like am i not allowed my phone in my hand. Even when my friend had asked her if she said sorry this girl said “hmm idk i can’t remember” bro…
thats a hint to maybe say sorry omg🤦🏻‍♀️. This girl even came along to see how much it was to get it fixed and it was like £60 but its not as bad as i thought it was still expensive until i went to apple store so they could have a look at it and to replace it there they said it would be like £280 minimum. Crazy right, but… but they couldn’t even replace the screen because when it landed on the floor when the girl knocked it out my hand the metal part of the phone around it bent over the screen so they cant even place another screen on top of it cuz it would crack as the metal part is in the way. They said my only options were to replace the phone and get a new one or just deal with the phone i have now. The worst part is it the camera that is cracked so i can’t even use my front camera and let me tell ya it’s not even 6 months old yet, i literally got this phone for Christmas. Oh and its not like this girl doesn’t have the money to pay for it, this girl is loaded and i mean shes got an allowance from her parents every 2 weeks, she doesn’t work, she even goes to dubai EVERY YEAR and her house is quite literally a mansion. I don’t know if i should ask her to pay because she’s someone that literally hates confrontation and would cry at literally anything. oh and bare in mind guys shes older than me.

1jtpejv,UAE,Struggling as a Fresher Android Developer in Dubai   Just Need One Chance,"
Hi everyone,
I’m a fresher Android developer currently in Dubai, and I just wanted to share my experience and maybe get some advice or encouragement from this amazing community.

It’s been really tough trying to land a job here. Almost every job posting asks for experience, and as someone just starting out, it feels like a never-ending loop—how do I get experience if no one gives me a chance? I’ve put in months of effort learning Kotlin and Java, building personal projects, and even doing freelance work to improve my skills. But still, companies seem hesitant to hire someone without a few years under their belt.

I know I’m not alone—many of us have dreams, goals, and a strong willingness to learn and grow if just given the opportunity. We don’t want handouts, just a foot in the door.

If any of you have been in this situation and managed to find a way through, I’d love to hear your story. Any tips, leads, or advice would mean the world to me.

To all the freshers out there—don’t give up. Let’s keep pushing forward.

Thanks for reading.

1jtpbbz,Euroleague,ABA league champion should get a wild card for EuroLeague,"Let's be honest, ABA league is not the domestic league. It is regional competition. Without something to fight for, what's the point to even be there?

First of all, the goal should be to promote basketball in as many different countries as possible. Especially if we talk about countries like Slovenia, Croatia, Montenegro, Bosnia or even some other cities in Serbia other than our capital. The solution which some are suggesting is, throw every club from former SFRJ under the bus, don't allow them to compete against the best clubs ever again, let only two clubs exist on serious level, that should be enough. It's completely and utterly wrong. Why?

1. The very reason why clubs from Belgrade have so much money right now is because corrupt leadership of our country wants some kind of marketing for them, and the easy solution is just throw our millions of euros to the EuroLeague, buy wildcards, licenses and every other crap available, make people believe that everything is much better than ten or fifhteen years ago when they hadn't been in charge. Now, EuroLeague is also corrupt as hell, that's why they want money from literally anyone, be it dictator Vucic or samo oil salesman from Dubai, they just don't care. They will say some lies about fans, but if it is only about fans where are other clubs with great football fans, like Aris or Besiktas? Why those clubs didn't get wildcards or invitations? That's right, they don't have money to spend.

2. The EuroLeague best interest should be to have clubs like Partizan before. That is, clubs without so much money, but with young prospects. Because, trust me, european basketball needs new prospects, new talents, new names. Not some another rich clubs with best coaches and experienced players. If you want to watch only big names and clubs full of expensive players, you should watch NBA, much better competition.

3. Like I said, we need to slow down with this crap about ""Serbians best in this"", ""Serbians best in that"". We don't need nationalism, we don't need some pride, we need humility and we need reality. This all crap about ""Serbian derby is the best"" makes me puke, because I know very well what it really means, brainwashing ""we should all support red-whites or black-whites whenever we live"". No, other cities and other coutries alse deserve the chance!

4. Like, KK Zadar have passionate fans! Why are they not in EuroLeague? Because they don't have money? Well, say that, it's about having a president who wants to throw million for his petty projects, not fans. What about Cedevita Olimpija? You know, it's not really the same club as were Olimpija, it's Cedevita and Olimpija molded into one. It's oxygen is some guy named Tedeschi, but he won't be there forever, and why would be there anyway if his club can't be in EuroLeague ever? What about Buducnost? Let them die, they are not important anyways, the only important teams are serbian president's toys. 

Look, if you think that what you have in greek or turkish league is great, with only two clubs who can play EuroLeague, then, sure. But don't cheer for destruction of every club in one great part of Europe other than you-know-which-two-clubs.  ",2025-04-07 16:21:26+00:00,17,25

1jtnxnp,Slime,"OG Slimes review! (dubai chocolate cake, banana pudding and bath bomb bubble bead)","I ordered banana pudding, dubai chocolate cake and bath bomb bubble bead. It also came with a freebie :)
Banana Pudding: 10/10!! I chose not to add the vanilla wafers and the graham cracker crust it came with because I prefer the yellow color it came as. The smell is SO good exactly like the name, it doesn't just smell like bananas it smells like banana pudding with the creamy and the graham cracker. The texture is SO thick and glossy and the add ins are so cute.
Dubai chocolate cake: 9/10! Oh my god the smell. It smells SOOOOO GOOD exactly like chocolate cake with pistachios in it. The pistachio add in is so cute and the texture of the pistachio filling is so interesting. When mixed all together it does get a little sticky and has some slight fallout but I'm pretty sure they advertise that it can happen. I foresee myself opening it just to smell it.
Bath bomb bubble bead: 11/10! OMG!! The texture before you mix anything in is so amazing it's literally like a massage for your hands. There's NO bead fallout and the smell is like a really nice cologne. The clay add in is also scented and it's slightly citrusy, it kind of reminds me of grapefruit in a good way. Once you mix it all together it inflates SO MUCH and the texture is so nice on my hands it's (like i said) literally like a massage for your hands and the final color is so so pretty.
Freebie: 10/10! its free its an instant 10/10. It's a clicky white glue slime and it's either unscented or lightly scented mango but either way I love it.

1jtnt0c,dubai,What are my options during a lengthy legal battle?,"TLDR: ***Ongoing legal case. ILOE claims rejected since visa is not yet cancelled. How to get ILOE claims approved?***

I currently have an ongoing legal case against my former employer for non-payment of WPS wages and breach of contract for not paying the agreed upon commission. The case has been going on since Jan 2025 (MOHRE) with it being moved to Dubai courts since Feb 2025.

ILOE has rejected my Job loss claim, since I am technically still employed (as the visa is not cancelled).

I have attended multiple interviews so far, with almost all of them rejecting me once they are made aware of my situation (As it is legally required for me to submit an NOC from Dubai Courts to my potential employer if I am to start working for them while the case is still active). All my savings has gone towards legal fees and other court related payments. My friends have been supporting me with as much as they could, but I no longer want to put them in a difficult situation because of what's going.

Is there any way that I can get my ILOE claims approved?",2025-04-07 15:19:16+00:00,2,0
1jtnswe,TrueOffMyChest,Why does Dubai feel so artificial? Like it’s a city without a soul.,"
Dubai is impressive, no doubt. It’s a feat of engineering, wealth, and ambition. But idk why it feels like a simulation of a city, just looks good on paper. Everything is curated, polished, optimized for image. There’s no grit, no tension, no imperfections, nothing that gives a place its humanity. 

I’ve just been there, and the feeling was immediate, like I’d stepped into a luxury showroom or a concept city built for a brochure, not for actual living. Everything is gleaming, massive, and meticulously designed, but there’s this strange emptiness underneath it all. It’s like someone asked, “What do rich people like?” and then built an entire city out of that answer.

I see that there’s no natural layers to the place. Cities usually carry a mix of yk grit, history, chaos, and identity that slowly form over time. But Dubai feels like it was dropped from the sky, prepackaged and ready to impress. It’s all presentation and skyscrapers, malls, luxury cars, artificial islands and none of it feels lived in. It’s like you’re walking through a simulation of wealth.


That’s not to say people aren’t building lives there, or that it doesn’t have its appeal. There’s efficiency, cleanliness, and ambition. But it’s ambition with no roots. The kind that grows up fast but doesn’t know why it’s growing in the first place.

Am I off? Or have others felt that too,that sense of being somewhere that looks impressive but doesn’t feel real? It’s just really hard for me to explain. ",2025-04-07 15:19:08+00:00,574,82

1jtnphj,DHA_pharmacist,How to Become a DHA Pharmacist – Start Here!,"Hey everyone!
Welcome to r/DHA_Pharmacist – if you’re here, you’re probably looking to work as a pharmacist in Dubai and want to know how to get that DHA license. I’ve seen a lot of confusion around the process, so here’s a simple breakdown to get you started:

⸻

Step 1: Check Eligibility
	•	You must have a pharmacy degree (BPharm, MPharm, PharmD)
	•	Minimum 2 years of work experience (sometimes flexible for certain roles)
	•	Transcripts, experience letters, and registration with your home country’s pharmacy board

⸻

Step 2: Create an Account on Sheryan (DHA Portal)
	•	Go to the Sheryan DHA website
	•	Make a professional account and start your application

⸻

Step 3: DataFlow Verification
	•	Upload your documents (degree, license, experience letters, passport, etc.)
	•	DataFlow will verify everything—it takes a few weeks
	•	You’ll get a Positive, Negative, or Unable to Verify report

⸻

Step 4: Schedule and Pass the DHA Exam
	•	Once your DataFlow is cleared, you’ll get an exam eligibility ID
	•	Book your Prometric exam (usually MCQs, mostly clinical + pharma knowledge)
	•	Passing score is around 60–65%

⸻

Step 5: Get Registered
	•	Once you pass the exam, you’ll receive your DHA Eligibility Letter
	•	Use this to start applying for jobs
	•	Once you’re hired, your employer will help convert this into a full DHA License

⸻

Tips:
	•	Use reliable study resources: Lexicomp, BPharm notes, Prometric practice questions
	•	Join study groups (Telegram/WhatsApp can help a lot)
	•	Don’t panic if DataFlow takes time—it’s normal
	•	Double-check every document before uploading!

⸻

That’s the basic roadmap! If you’ve already started your process, feel free to share your progress, ask questions, or help others out. Let’s make this subreddit a solid guide for all future DHA pharmacists.

Drop your questions below!
And if you’ve already passed or are working in the UAE, we’d love to hear your experience!",2025-04-07 15:15:10+00:00,1,0

1jtnlzc,uaelaw,"Im tired, someone please help.","Hey guys! So i work as a freelancer and had visa from a close friend of mine for the past 2 years which expired in Feb 2025 (currently on 3 months grace period) . Last year i decided to get my own trade license because i wanted to expand my small business and do it legally.

I live in UAE with my mother. Shes been here since the seventies. After my father passed away, every two years we had to figure out how we will get our visas. So I decided to make her an investor in my company and get a manager visa from the labour department myself. 

So heres the issue, my mom is the sole owner of the Dubai mainland license. She is currently out of the country since December 2024, we cancelled her previous visa and wanted to bring her on new investor visa. I applied for her visa in Jan 2025 and it got rejected because she is Pakistani even though her age is almost 70. 

I didnt open a labour file in the MOHRE and now i cant get a visa in my own company because my mother can not come to UAE without a visa and without her we can’t open labour file

We currently have active establishment card and trade license and memorandum and her UAE pass is active. Can someone please help me with my options? 

- is there a way i can transfer the ownership to myself ? 
- is there a way i can open the Lanour file using a POA from my mother? 
- should i try to get her here on visit visa?
- is there another option that i have?

I have spent so much money and i am going broke and i have 34 days remaining in my grace period and i am starting to worry. Every PRO is giving different answer and i am not sure what to do. If there is anyone with any information i will be forever gratfeul. Thank you!

Breed: British Shorthair 
Age: 2.4 years old
Location: Dubai
Neutered male, weighs 4.5kg~, with history of FIP that was treated at 7months - 1 years old with GS injection and no apparent relapse or issues 

We live on the 26th floor and our cat never interacts with outdoor cats. We noticed he's been drinking more water than usual for 2-3 days. Yesterday we noticed he was warm around the ears so we took him to the vet today. 

Vet said she doesn't know what's wrong with him but he has a fever, and after drawing blood said he might have liver impairment and that his creatinine is a little high but nothing worrisome, she also said he's anemic. Didn't give us anymore information and told us to check in in 2 weeks if he's still tired. She gave him a multivitamin and a shot to bring the fever down

His eating and habits haven't changed except for the increased thirst and visible lethargy that started last night with the fever. Does the blood test indicate anything specific? Should I see a better vet?

# My Situation:

* **39, Eastern European**, single mom (7 y/o), attractive blonde, **polished, high EQ**, multilingual, few degrees.
* **Relocating to Dubai by September**—but unsure which path to take:
   * **Option 1:** Re-enter the corporation 
   * **Option 2:** Start a business (but funding/risk is shaky).
   * **Option 3:** Seek a **long-term sugar/or family-oriented relationship**.
* **Past lifestyle:** $12K/month income + travel, housing, and perks, but now rebuilding post-divorce from a **dominant high-net-worth partner**.

# My Dilemma:

* **Age deadline:** I know my “market value” declines after 40-45 in elite circles.
* **I need stability** (apartment, school fees,  helper), but I’m torn between **self-sufficiency vs. finding a provider**.

# Questions for SLF:

1. **Honestly—at 39 with a kid, can I find a true LT provider in Dubai?** Or should I focus on career/business?
2. **What’s the ‘standard’ arrangement range** for women like me in Dubai or USA? (I need **$10K+/month** to maintain my lifestyle—is that delusional?)
3. **Where do I look?** [Seeking.com](http://Seeking.com)  \- i feel ashamed to be seen there as it feels like prostitution, without recovery chance in the eyes of the guy... i was thinking of ""Luxy"" and starting just from making friends.
4. **Married SDs vs. family-minded ones?** I’m open to either, but need transparency.

# What I Bring:

* **No drama**, Sharp wit – Dark humor optional but available
* Fluent in boardroom, ballroom, and “how did we end up at this underground speakeasy?”
*  **Discreet, high-caliber companionship**—I enhance your world socially and intellectually, adept in high-society settings. 
* Happy, lighthearted, carrying, yet a bit provocative and real
* The kind of woman who **walks into a room quietly but leaves an impression**.

According to the State Department website, the current wait time for a visa appointment in Dubai is around 70 days, while in Abu Dhabi it’s about 120 days. My question is, how accurate are these numbers? Based on what I’ve seen here on Reddit, they are not , and actual wait times can vary a lot.

Also, how many times are we allowed to reschedule a visa appointment in the UAE? I’ve heard that in some countries, like India, you can only reschedule once. Does the same rule apply to the UAE?

As the title says, I want to buy a car. New in UAE.
Budget is 40k-50k (I can pay more if offer is really good), 3-6 years old. Also, I am totally fine with cheaper than this 😅 as long the car is in good shape and have some perks like navigation screen, automatic climate, aplle/android connection etc.. 
I have two kids, 9 and 7 years, so something that is comfortable (but not to big, I do not want SUVs, maybe crossover as the biggest) and that we can pack some things for weekend drive around the UAE.
I assume that I should go for GCC specs.
I am buying a car that I will drive for 1-2 years. After that, when I see how I stand with expenses and everything, will maybe sell it and buy something better, newer.

So, what do you recommend? 
How have the European cars performed in this climate? 
Chinese one? Are they good? Are the prices of Chinese cars dropping more than the others?
Which car model would you recommend from your experience?

This year’s edition pushed [technological artistry](https://worldmagzine.com/trending/hybe-we-believe-in-music-exploring-k-pops-global-impact/) to new limits. It used almost 6,000 drones to craft the world’s largest flying LED screen. The precision and synchronization created a screen that could display videos in the sky, transforming the airspace above Meydan into a giant cinema.

Spectators were treated to a choreographed blend of visual storytelling. This included aerial 3D representations of UAE’s leaders, racing elements, and traditional poetry. It wasn’t just eye-catching—it was emotionally resonant. The show paid homage to the nation’s identity while showcasing its futuristic ambitions.

Guinness World Records confirmed that Dubai Racing Club not only beat their 2024 record but redefined what’s possible with drone technology in live events. The show demonstrated how far drone displays have evolved. They are no longer gimmicks, but a [medium](https://worldmagzine.com/business/unequal-growth-how-uk-policies-favor-medium-sized-businesses-over-micro-businesses/) for real-time storytelling at massive scales.

The ceremony wrapped with a heartfelt message: “See you next year: 30th anniversary of Dubai World Cup.” This signaled that it was not an end, but a preview of what’s yet to come. As Dubai continues to set the global standard in event innovation, all eyes are already on 2026.

Dubai didn’t just close the World Cup with fireworks—it launched a new era of immersive [entertainment](https://worldmagzine.com/celebrity/taeyeon-sm-entertainment-and-korean-companies-unite-for-wildfire-relief/). Innovation meets culture in the skies above.

* £900,000 available to secondary schools to expand Welsh-speaking teaching staff.
* [Schools](https://worldmagzine.com/education/ensuring-equal-education-for-all-addressing-discrimination-in-schools/) use grants for training, subject expansion, and collaboration.
* Part of a wider mission to reach one million Welsh speakers.

The Welsh Government’s Welsh-medium capacity building grant has become a key tool in addressing the shortage of Welsh-speaking [teachers](https://worldmagzine.com/education/malaysia-invests-rm9-million-in-ai-and-leadership-training-for-teachers/). It not only funds innovative school-led solutions to staffing issues but also promotes curriculum diversity through the Welsh language.

Past recipients like Ysgol Rhydywaun have seen[ tangible benefits](https://worldmagzine.com/crypto/fifa-coin-the-cryptocurrency-that-could-revolutionize-football/). They used the grant to train existing staff in new subject areas and expand A-level options.

# Building a Bilingual Future: Welsh Schools Empowered by Targeted Grants

The Welsh-medium capacity building grant supports Welsh-medium and bilingual secondary schools in developing their teaching staff. This helps to deliver a broader curriculum in Welsh. This initiative directly aligns with the Welsh [Government](https://worldmagzine.com/dubai/dubai-government-approves-aed-277-million-in-performance-based-bonuses/)’s target of one million Welsh speakers by 2050.

By allowing schools to use the grant creatively—such as retraining staff or forming teaching partnerships—educators are better equipped to provide high-quality education in the Welsh language. These efforts are particularly impactful in shortage subject areas like STEM and humanities.

The grant complements wider efforts like Cynllun Pontio, which helps Welsh-speaking teachers transition to secondary [education](https://worldmagzine.com/education/zayed-education-foundation-uaes-vision-for-global-leadership/). Additionally, the Iaith Athrawon Yfory incentive offers £5,000 to trainee teachers. These layered schemes reflect a holistic strategy for growing the Welsh-medium education sector.

Importantly, the grant is not just about workforce numbers—it’s about cultivating a thriving ecosystem of Welsh-medium teaching. This is achieved through mentorship, career pathways, and retention strategies. As a result, more learners can pursue their education in Welsh. They have access to a broader selection of subjects and better teacher support.

With continued government support and school innovation, schemes like the Welsh-medium capacity building grant are paving the way for a bilingual future. These schemes ensure students can thrive [academically ](https://worldmagzine.com/education/the-war-in-ukraine-leaves-millions-of-children-without-education/)while embracing the Welsh language.

Vintageshopaholic · Today 12:24

I basically am lost for words and need some advice understanding how and where I move forward from here.

me and my husband and DD 5 went to Dubai for a few days to see our friends who live there. We extended our stay and we were having a wonderful time.

on Friday I left my husband and his friend to go and have a drink at the hotel bar. I took dd to bed in the hotel (bar is upstairs) and the wife of the friend took her baby to bed at home.

basically both the men went on a mad one and partied all night, they went to a club at another hotel and I woke at 4am calling and calling as my husband was not home and I had no communication from him. They got a hotel room at our hotel and crashed.

they came into our room at 10am the next day absolutely battered and started drinking from the mini bar. It is at this point I see a message from ‘star’ (prossie looking image) on what’s app on my husbands phone. I open the messages and it says from my husband ‘ready to rumble’ she goes ‘mmm’ he then says ‘payment link’

she then sends a payment link and underneath puts - this girl gone, I want to see you.

long story short they went out picked up this woman in a bar and she ended up back at the hotel in the room with them. My husband claims he was trying to get dr\*gs off her and that it was his friend who was upstairs with her.

im lost for words, I left Dubai with my daughter and told him not to come home. He is flying back today. There have been numerous calls at this stage I don’t know what to think. Am I being stupid. I am adamant he has cheated and feel sick to my stomach, but he has promised me he hasn’t and that he’s scared himself with what’s happened.

1jtjhbb,interviews,Dubai interview,"I went for a walk in interview last Thursday in Dubai, 50+ candidates, got shortlisted after HR,then gave a written test, after which had a finance manager round. HR said that she will call for the final round with the CEO. Got a call next day on Friday for the CEO interview on the same day. There were 2 more candidates with me. After my interview with the CEO, he got busy so decided for some other person to take interview for the 3rd candidate. The candidate didn't seem happy about it. HR said that she will call me in 1 or 2 days. Monday is almost over and I haven't heard anything. All the jobs I have got in the past were on the same day or the next day. The wait is so difficult. The job posting was taken down the same evening when we gave CEO interview. There was another walk in interview day before I went so I assume there were 50+ candidates in that batch also so 3 would have got shortlisted from that so altogether 5 candidates who were interviewed by the CEO. It's a mid sized company (around 100 to 200 employees). I know often HR calls the next day in the morning with a job offer. Considering the job posting was taken down on the same day when I was interviewed by the CEO, is it safe to assume that the job is given to someone else? I am losing hope now 😢 😔.

1jtjgl5,WorldMagzineMedia,Kawasaki Unveils Corleo: The Rideable Robot of the Future,"https://preview.redd.it/p39s2w3fjete1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e7e15bd4f67f89c747396c9852627d76b2a64644

* Corleo is a hydrogen-powered, AI-driven rideable [obot](https://worldmagzine.com/technology/chinas-robotic-dog-enhances-tunnel-inspections-with-ai-precision/) from Kawasaki.
* Designed to traverse rough terrain, it can jump and maintain stability.
* Mass production is not expected before 2050.

Kawasaki has taken a bold step into the future of mobility with Corleo, a quadrupedal robot that doubles as a [personal transport](https://worldmagzine.com/politics/starmer-faces-policy-challenges-amid-transport-and-justice-controversies/) vehicle. Unveiled at a trade fair in Osaka, Corleo is powered by a 150 cc hydrogen engine. This engine generates electricity to operate motors on each of its legs.

What truly sets Corleo apart is its use of advanced [artificial intelligence ](https://worldmagzine.com/education/discover-some-of-the-best-artificial-intelligence-tools-for-students-and-teachers/)for navigation. Unlike traditional vehicles that rely on manual control, Corleo maintains balance and stability through real-time spatial analysis.

# Corleo: Kawasaki’s AI-Powered Hydrogen Robot Redefines Off-Road Travel

Corleo represents a fusion of robotics, clean energy, and artificial intelligence. By using hydrogen as its fuel source, Kawasaki positions this concept as an eco-conscious innovation in a[ world ](https://worldmagzine.com/entertainment/unveiling-ai-in-the-real-world-tron-ares-trailer/)seeking sustainable transport options. Its hydrogen engine doesn’t directly power the robot’s legs. Instead, it generates electricity for the motors, a hybrid-like approach with futuristic implications.

The robot’s structure and legged design give it capabilities far beyond traditional wheeled vehicles. While most off-road SUVs struggle with rocky or steep terrain, Corleo is built to climb, jump, and navigate with precision thanks to its mechanical limbs. Promotional visuals suggest an experience more akin to horseback riding than driving. This adds a new sensory layer to travel.

Kawasaki emphasizes the robot’s potential to serve more than just thrill-seekers. It could revolutionize rescue missions, rural travel, and exploration in difficult environments where traditional [vehicles](https://worldmagzine.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-powered-police-patrol-vehicles-in-dubai-will-come-soon/) can’t reach. This makes Corleo as much a tool as it is a transport mode—offering practical applications beyond recreation.

Although Corleo is still far from commercial release, the company’s use of generative AI in promotional videos hints at the ambitious roadmap ahead. These visuals don’t just illustrate features—they project a vision. This vision is likely crafted to inspire both public interest and investor confidence as technology progresses toward feasibility.

Kawasaki’s Corleo is more than a concept—it’s a[ glimpse](https://worldmagzine.com/trending/princess-beatrice-steps-up-a-glimpse-into-her-royal-future/) into a transformative future where intelligent, rideable robots could redefine how we explore and interact with our world.

1jtjeub,dubai,Employer didn't renew insurance last year — now using it to pressure decision to stay. Is this legal? (UAE),"I work in the UAE and my employer failed to renew our health insurance last year, even though it's legally required. One of my colleagues recently resigned and cited this as a breach of contract, leaving without serving the notice period.

Now, my employer is asking if I’m planning to stay. She said that if I confirm I’m staying, she will apply for my insurance. If I don’t confirm, she won’t renew it at all. At the same time, she insists that I cannot resign without serving the full notice period.

She also told me, quite directly, that I can't use the lack of insurance as a reason to resign without notice—because she had already asked me twice if I was staying, implying I had a chance to speak up. It feels like she's trying to cover herself after breaching the contract, while still demanding full compliance from me.

This seems manipulative, and possibly illegal. Can an employer withhold mandatory health insurance depending on whether an employee plans to stay or not? And is it fair/legal to enforce the notice period when she herself is in breach of contract?

Would appreciate any advice or similar experiences—especially if you’re familiar with UAE labor law.

I’m in the IT field, with a focus on project-based roles – Project Coordinator, Project Manager, Scrum Master, Assistant Project Manager, and similar roles in that line.

I started off focusing solely on the IT domain, but over time, I’ve expanded my search to include construction, healthcare, and other industries as well. Project management skills are largely transferable, and I’m open to opportunities across various sectors.

I’m a PMP and CSPO certified professional, and I’m passionate about what I do — but this journey has definitely taken a toll. The lack of responses, rejections, and ghosting can really mess with your energy and motivation.

If anyone here knows of any openings, or even better, is willing to refer me or just guide me in the right direction, I’d deeply appreciate it. Even a small lead can make a big difference right now.

And if you’re in the same boat or have been through something similar, feel free to PM me — whether to share tips, exchange experiences, or just talk things out. Sometimes just talking to someone who gets it can make a difference.

Between paperwork, middlemen, delays, and unclear rules, it can be a headache. That’s where smart contracts on the blockchain are starting to quietly flip the script.

Imagine this: You find a place you like, read a clear contract stored on the blockchain, and once you send the agreed rent, access to the property (like a digital key) is automatically granted. No waiting. No awkward calls. No chasing landlords or agents.

Smart contracts are basically self-executing digital agreements. They only act when both sides meet the terms. So if the rent isn’t paid, access doesn’t happen. If it is, everything goes through instantly. Everything’s transparent, time-stamped, and secure.

This doesn’t mean agents or landlords disappear; it just makes the system way smoother and more honest. Especially in short-term rentals or co-living spaces, this tech can save time, build trust, and remove unnecessary friction.

It's not some sci-fi future. In places like Dubai and parts of Europe, this is already happening. Slowly, but surely, the way we rent is getting smarter, and it's about time.

1jtiww0,BiteYourConsole,[Scena Switch] Rilasciato un nuovo aggiornamento per il porting di 2048 per la console ibrida Nintendo Switch,"Best curtains shop in Dubai[Scena Switch] Rilasciato un nuovo aggiornamento per il porting di 2048 per la console ibrida Nintendo Switchhttps://www.biteyourconsole.net/wp-content/uploads/duemilaquarantotto.webphttps://dubaicurtainshops.com/Il developer BernardoGiordano ha recentemente ripreso in mano lo sviluppo di 2048 su console Nintendo Switch, tornando a lavorare su un progetto che aveva abbandonato per ben sette anni.\
2048 è un rompicapo freeware che sfida i giocatori a manipolare una griglia 4x4, spostando piastrelle numerate in orizzontale o in verticale per combinarle e raggiungere l’obiettivo di creare una tessera con il valore 2048, da cui il gioco prende il nome.\
Le piastrelle nella griglia contengono numeri, tutti multipli di 2, e quando due tessere con lo stesso valore si scontrano, si fondono in una sola, il cui numero è la somma delle due tessere precedenti.\
Questo processo di combinazione incrementa il punteggio del giocatore, visibile in alto a destra, che parte da zero e cresce ogni volta che due tessere si uniscono, aggiungendo il valore della nuova casella al totale.\
La partita si considera vinta quando il giocatore riesce a ottenere una tessera con il numero 2048, anche se è possibile continuare a giocare oltre questo traguardo per aumentare il punteggio.\
Tuttavia, il gioco termina se non ci sono più mosse disponibili, ovvero quando la griglia è piena e non ci sono tessere adiacenti con lo stesso valore da combinare.\
BernardoGiordano ha condiviso i dettagli di questo ritorno al progetto in un aggiornamento, spiegando di aver finalmente sistemato il codice per far funzionare nuovamente il gioco su Switch, dopo che alcuni cambiamenti critici avevano reso il software inutilizzabile negli ultimi anni.\
Ha raccontato di aver originariamente portato 2048 sulla console nel 2018, un’impresa compiuta senza nemmeno possedere una Switch per testarlo, definendo l’esperienza come molto divertente.\
All’epoca, il rendering del gioco si basava esclusivamente sulla CPU, poiché non erano ancora disponibili strumenti avanzati per sfruttare la GPU nella comunità di sviluppo homebrew per Switch.\
Negli ultimi sette anni, però, la scena homebrew ha fatto grandi progressi, rendendo il rendering grafico tramite GPU molto più accessibile.\
Nonostante ciò, BernardoGiordano ha deciso di non aggiornare il gioco per passare al rendering GPU, considerando 2048 un progetto semplice e leggero, un “toy project” come lo ha definito.\
Ha comunque lasciato aperta la porta a contributi esterni, invitando chiunque a migliorare il codice, ora che il gioco è di nuovo funzionante.\
\
Istruzioni\
\
 	Avviare il gioco dall'homebrew launcher e iniziare a giocare, è possibile iniziare una nuova partita premendo il tasto .\
 	Lo stato attuale del gioco verrà salvato quando si esce utilizzando il tasto  e verrà caricato automaticamente la volta successiva in cui si avvia il gioco.\

I’m about to rent my first apartment ever in Dubai as I just moved here, and I’m super confused about this whole “chiller free” vs “non-chiller free” thing.

I work from home full time and will be setting up a proper desk setup with monitors, lights, etc. I also film videos for work, so I tend to use a decent amount of electricity. On top of that, I’ll probably have the AC on most of the day – like 80% of the time at least.

From what I understand, if the apartment is **chiller free**, I don’t have to worry about the AC cost at all (except for the electricity used to power the AC I will pay with the DEWA bill if I understand correctly), and if it’s **non-chiller free**, I’ll get billed based on usage?

If I go for a **non-chiller free apartment**, how much should I expect to pay monthly with my kind of usage (AC almost always on, computer gear, lights for filming, etc)? Just looking for ballpark figures so I don’t get surprised.

* [China](https://worldmagzine.com/world/eu-china-canada-challenge-us-tariffs-to-protect-trade/) sweeps 4 golds, showcasing diving supremacy.
* Mexico earns 3 silvers, marking a historic milestone.
* Britain grabs two medals, including Spendolini-Sirieix’s platform bronze.

China reaffirmed its global diving dominance on Day 3 of the 2025 World Aquatics [Diving World Cup](https://worldmagzine.com/world/climate-change-cause-many-dangers-to-many-species-in-the-world/) in Guadalajara, sweeping all four gold medals up for grabs

Host[ nation Mexico](https://worldmagzine.com/technology/dubais-hassyan-swro-plant-pioneers-renewable-powered-desalination/) thrilled the home crowd with three silver medals, including a standout gold in the men’s 3m synchronised event by Osmar Olvera Ibarra and Juan Manuel Celaya Hernandez

# Guadalajara Glory: Diving World Cup Sees China’s Sweep, Mexico’s Rise

Saturday’s competition began with the women’s 3m synchronised springboard. China pulled ahead in the latter rounds to clinch gold. Meanwhile, Mexico and Australia fought fiercely for the remaining podium spots. Mexico’s [final](https://worldmagzine.com/entertainment/vijays-final-act-jana-nayagan-set-for-grand-pongal-2026-release/) dive won them silver in a nail-biting finish, bringing the crowd to its feet.

In the women’s 10m platform, Chen Yuxi and Quan Hongchan delivered a closely contested battle. Chen ultimately triumphed with 419.35 points, though Quan stayed close with 414.40. Britain’s Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix recovered from early mistakes in the prelims to clinch the bronze with 337.70.

Britain’s medal momentum continued in the men’s 3m synchro as [Olympic](https://worldmagzine.com/sports/vinesh-phogats-heroic-return-wrestling-star-welcomed-with-grand-celebrations-despite-olympic-disappointment/) veterans Jack Laugher and Anthony Harding delivered a solid series of dives. They scored 396.06 points. However, they were edged out by the Mexican duo, who earned gold with strong consistency and crowd support.

China’s fourth gold likely came from another synchronised discipline. This solidified their total haul for the day at four golds and one silver. The nation’s emphasis on training discipline and execution remains unmatched in international diving.

Day 3 in Guadalajara not only spotlighted China’s continued excellence. It also highlighted Mexico’s[ emergence](https://worldmagzine.com/business/rural-rentals-to-shape-new-cpi-series-from-february-2026/) as a formidable diving force and Britain’s rising consistency.

1jtilt1,dubai,Need advice about pregnancy and insurance renewal (Dubaicare),"Hi everyone,

  
My wife is pregnant, but we haven’t informed our health insurance provider (Dubaicare) yet. The insurance is active but expires on **May 21st**, and the expected delivery is in **November**. The current cost is **4500 AED**.

We’re based in **Dubai**, and this is our **first baby**, so we’re not sure how things work when it comes to insurance and pregnancy here.

I’m not sure how the renewal process works or whether the cost will increase once they know she’s pregnant. Should we inform the insurance company now or wait until after renewal? And should she go to a doctor now so it’s officially recorded?

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Did your renewal cost go up, or was everything smooth?

Any advice would be really appreciated. ",2025-04-07 11:06:14+00:00,1,3

Nido trip on Instagram. He was in Dubai when he started feeling ill. 

A similar incident happened in 2023 when Antti Lukkari (Swedish executive chef and guest judge of Masterchef Finland) died of sepsis due to bacteria strains acquired during their vacation in El Nido. I cannot find any PH news about this but there are Swedish news outlets who have reported it.

I’ve been to El Nido several times. I had stomach issues during my first visit. I stuck with water bottles in my next visits. I’m thinking how aggressive and life threatening these bacteria can become and how can PH tourism take action.

1jti026,pregnant,Unsure on weather to get an abortion or not,"I'm 27 years old and my husband is 32. We've been together for almost 10 years and we run a business together. The business is up and down and we're also in the middle of relocating from the UK to Dubai. I've just found out I'm pregnant and I know sometimes there's never a right time, but we're unsure on whether to keep it or not. We were hoping to have a baby in 18 months time.

I feel super guilty because I had an abortion when I was 21, and now it feels like because I'm married ect then I should just keep it as I feel so guilty.

I'm unsure how we'd handle it in the midst of relocating countries (staying in the uk isn't an option), plus with how up and down business is, I'm worried about it financially.

Any advice would be hugely appreciated.

EDIT: I appreciate all the messages, and this has helped so much. I just wanted to answer a few questions regarding why 18 months.

6 years ago, my partner and I lived in Australia for just over a year, and my partner absolutely fell in love with it! We planned to head back to the UK, save a little money, and then fully relocate. But when we got back to the UK, covid happened, and the world got locked down as we know.

During this time, we decided to start a business, and before we knew it, 6 years had passed. During these 6 years, my partner has constantly mentioned how unhappy he is living in the UK and how much he wants to relocate to anywhere but just not the uk.

Both his and my brothers and sisters have permanently relocated, and I just don't want to put him in a position where he feels trapped. We mentioned 18 months because we already had everything planned and organised to relocate to dubai in September, where we were planning on setting up the business there.

Hope that's provided a better insight.",2025-04-07 10:27:05+00:00,1,4

I came to Dubai in 2012, chasing a dream like many others. The city was bright, fast, and full of promise. My journey wasn’t always smooth, but every challenge shaped who I am today.

Since then, I’ve worked for nine different companies. Each job came with new experiences, new people, and new lessons. From my first role to the latest, I’ve grown—both professionally and personally.

In 2016, a big chapter of my life began—I got married. That same year, I bought my first car, a symbol of how far I had come. Every day since then, I’ve been driving from Sharjah to Dubai and back. The commute became a routine, a quiet time to reflect, plan, and sometimes just enjoy the road.

Through all the highs and lows, Dubai became more than just a place to work—it became my second home. And the journey is still going on.
